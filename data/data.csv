Change in Estradiol Levels among Premenopausal Patients with Breast Cancer Treated Using Leuprolide Acetate 11.25 Milligrams 3-Month Depot and Tamoxifen.,"The combination of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs (LHRHa) with tamoxifen is used as a standard postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive/premenopausal breast cancer. Long-acting LHRHa formulations offer advantages in terms of patient convenience. However, data on the effectiveness of the 3-month (3M) acting formulation are still insufficient. This study was performed on patients who received the 3M LHRHa after surgery. The serum estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were measured before surgery, and periodically after surgery. In total, 318 patients were included in the study and analyzed. The mean E2 level before surgery was 63.7 pg/mL, while the mean E2 level during the administration of 3M LHRHa was 4.9 pg/mL. None of the patients were menstruating and had E2 values above 30.0 pg/mL. It is thought that the 3M LHRHa formulation can suppress the ovarian function effectively and be safely used to improve compliance.",['Lee YJ; Wu ZY; Kim HJ; Lee JW; Chung IY; Kim J; Lee SB; Son BH; Kim SB; Jung JH; Gong G; Ahn SH; Ko B'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33154830,318 patients were included in the study and analyzed. the mean E2 level before surgery was 63.7 pg/mL.
Age at menarche and premenstrual syndrome in adolescent girls with intellectual disability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.,"The issues involving menstruation are the topic of many scientific inquiries in the fields of medicine, psychology, sociology and anthropology. The aim of this study was to determine the age at menarche and the most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescent girls with intellectual disability. The main method of data collection was through the use of a survey and an interview with the girls. The sample consisted of 31 adolescent girls with intellectual disability and 31 adolescent girls without intellectual disability serving as a control group. Both groups were between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The results of this study revealed higher variability of age at menarche in girls with intellectual disability compared to girls without intellectual disability. The symptoms of PMS were almost equally distributed in both groups of girls. Many girls with intellectual disability do not have enough knowledge about menstruation. More attention needs to be given to treating the symptoms of PMS and educating the girls in a school setting.",['Ibralic I; Sinanovic O; Memisevic H'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20207519,the study was conducted in a study of 31 adolescent girls with intellectual disability. the study was conducted by a survey and an interview with the girls. the results revealed higher variability of age at menarche in girls with intellectual disability compared to girls without intellectual disability.
Archaeological evidence of an ethnographically documented Australian Aboriginal ritual dated to the last ice age.,"In societies without writing, ethnographically known rituals have rarely been tracked back archaeologically more than a few hundred years. At the invitation of GunaiKurnai Aboriginal Elders, we undertook archaeological excavations at Cloggs Cave in the foothills of the Australian Alps. In GunaiKurnai Country, caves were not used as residential places during the early colonial period (mid-nineteenth century CE), but as secluded retreats for the performance of rituals by Aboriginal medicine men and women known as 'mulla-mullung', as documented by ethnographers. Here we report the discovery of buried 11,000- and 12,000-year-old miniature fireplaces with protruding trimmed wooden artefacts made of Casuarina wood smeared with animal or human fat, matching the configuration and contents of GunaiKurnai ritual installations described in nineteenth-century ethnography. These findings represent 500 generations of cultural transmission of an ethnographically documented ritual practice that dates back to the end of the last ice age and that contains Australia's oldest known wooden artefacts.",['David B; Mullett R; Wright N; Stephenson B; Ash J; Fresløv J; Delannoy JJ; McDowell MC; Mialanes J; Petchey F; Arnold LJ; Rogers AJ; Crouch J; Green H; Urwin C; Matheson CD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38951612,"ethnographicly documented rituals date back to the end of the last ice age. in societies without writing, ethnographically known rituals have rarely been tracked back archaeologically more than a few hundred years."

Steadiness of plate motions over the earthquake cycle is a central tenet of the plate tectonics theory and has long been a main pillar in models of earthquake genesis, or of plate-margins seismic potential inferred from slip-deficit estimates. The advent of geodesy in the geosciences and the availability of multi-year-long series of position measurements permit tracking the motions of tectonic plates from before to after the time of significant seismic events that occur along their margins. Here, we present evidence that large earthquakes are capable of modifying the motions of entire microplates. We use high precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position time-series covering the periods 2001-2004 and 2014-2017 to demonstrate that, contrary to the tenet above, the South China microplate motion changed after the 2008 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msub><mi>M</mi> <mi>W</mi></msub> </math> 7.9 Great Wenchuan earthquake. The GNSS data and associated uncertainties indicate a plate motion slowdown of up to 20% that is beyond the possible impact of data noise and is thus tectonically meaningful. We use quantitative models of torque balance to show that generating this kinematic change requires a force upon the South China microplate compatible with that imparted by the Great Wenchuan earthquake of 2008. The existence of a kinematic signal linked to the earthquake cycle that impacts an entire microplate might offer an additional, novel perspective to assessing the hazards of earthquake-prone tectonic regions.",['Iaffaldano G; Martin de Blas J; Rui X; Stamps DS; Bin Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39014128,"tectonic plate motions drive the earthquake cycle, as they result in the slow accrual and sudden release of energy along plate boundaries. tectonic plate motions drive the earthquake cycle, as they result in the slow accrual and sudden release of energy along plate boundaries."
Characteristics of the menstrual cycle in 13-year-old Flemish girls and the impact of menstrual symptoms on social life.,"This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle and their impact on social activities in young teenage girls. Between March and June 2009, all girls born in 1996 who were residents of eight regions in Flanders (Belgium) received a semi-structured questionnaire, including questions about the age of menarche, characteristics of the menstrual cycle, and its impact on social activities. Participants were 792 13-year-old girls (15.7 % of the target population). Out of 363 (47.2 % of participants) postmenarcheal girls, 41.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 36.4-47.0 %) reported painful menstruations. The proportion of girls with painful menstrual periods decreased approximately 16 % with each year the age at menarche increased (relative risk (RR) = 0.84; 0.73-0.98; p < 0.05) and was positively correlated with the amount of blood loss (RR = 0.33; 0.16-0.67; p < 0.05 when little and 1.85; 1.49-2.31; p < 0.001 when abundant, compared to average). One in four (25.4 %) postmenarcheal girls indicated a negative impact of menstruation on social activities, but this proportion was significantly higher in girls who experienced menstruation as painful (41.3 %) compared to those who did not (14.2 %). Early menstrual complaints are common in young adolescent girls and the likelihood of pain increased significantly with lower menarcheal age. What is Known? • Menstrual cycle-related symptoms may negatively interfere with school absence and social activities. • Early menarche and severe dysmenorrhea are correlated with endometriosis. What is New? • In this large population-based study on the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in young teenage girls at or shortly after menarche, painful menstruation was highly prevalent (41.7 %), but related school absenteeism was low (3.2 %). The likelihood of pain increased significantly with lower menarcheal age. • The findings support the need for a systematic evaluation of the characteristics of the menstrual cycle shortly after menarche.","[""Hoppenbrouwers K; Roelants M; Meuleman C; Rijkers A; Van Leeuwen K; Desoete A; D'Hooghe T""]",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26670027,"study aims to investigate the characteristics of menstrual symptoms in 13-year-old girls. participants were 792 13-year-old girls (15.7 % of the target population) out of 363 (47.2 % of participants) postmenarcheal girls, 41.6 % reported painful menstruations."
Menstrual and perimenopausal migraine: A narrative review.,"Migraine is affected by the changing hormone environment, with perimenopause associated with increased migraine, particularly menstrual migraine. Menstrual attacks are recognised to be more disabling and less responsive to treatment compared with non-menstrual attacks. Perimenstrual estrogen 'withdrawal' is implicated in the pathophysiology of menstrual migraine, with increased prevalence of migraine in perimenopause associated with unpredictable estrogen fluctuations. Perimenopausal women often have contraceptive needs as well as menopause symptoms and it is important to understand the potential effects of exogenous hormones on migraine. Maintaining stable estrogen levels with exogenous hormones can benefit migraine but clinical trial data are limited. This short narrative review addresses the diagnosis and management of menstrual migraine in perimenopausal women, and discusses the management of menopause symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women with migraine.",['MacGregor EA'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33158484,menstrual migraine is associated with increased migraine. menstrual attacks are more disabling and less responsive to treatment. menstrual attacks are recognised to be more disabling.
Prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and related factors among nurses.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common condition among women during their menstrual cycle. PMS can negatively affect a woman's daily life and function. Nurses, as an important and substantial segment of healthcare staff, are affected by the demanding environment of work place. Since PMS, as a prevalent counterproductive condition, has not been studied in this population in Iran, we assessed the prevalence of PMS and its associated factors among nurses aged 23 to 49 in teaching hospitals of the Tehran province of Iran. In this cross-sectional study from April 2021 to January 2022, 280 participants from teaching hospitals were enrolled. Simple random sampling was used to determine the sample size of the study. Two validated questionnaires and a data gathering sheet were used to collect information. The premenstrual symptoms screening tool was used to determine PMS severity and the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire to evaluate the associated job demands. Demographic data and work-related data included: night shift, shift type, monthly COVID-19 care and gynecologic and past medical history were gathered. Then data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis, chi-square and t-test. The severity of PMS was: mild (42.5%); moderate (30%); and severe (27.5%). Regular menstruation and dysmenorrhea were reported by 84.6% and 72.3%, respectively. Moderate to severe PMS was associated with: monthly COVID shift (p=0.02); emotional (p<0.01) and quantitative (p<0.01) demands; regular caffeine intake (p=0.01); education level (p=0.005); regular exercise (p=0.003); regular fiber intake (p=0.08); and irregular menstrual cycles (p=0.007). In logistic regression only quantitative (p=0.003) and emotional (p=0.018) job demands were significant. Results showed that the prevalence of PMS was high among Iranian nurses and was associated with quantitative and emotional job demands. We suggest further studies focusing on preventative and effective interventions to diminish the consequences of PMS in this population. We also suggest investigating the practical application of the findings of this study for healthcare professionals and policymakers.",['Saraei M; Shahrbabak ZM; Khalafi F; Aminian O; Eftekhari S; Izadi N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38867710,premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common condition among women during their menstrual cycle. the condition can negatively affect a woman's daily life and function.
Luteal Phase Defects and Progesterone Supplementation.,"Luteal phase defects (LPDs), or an insufficiency of progesterone production during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, have been identified as a potential cause of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), but its exact contribution to RPL is not well-defined. In addition, the role of exogenous progesterone supplementation during pregnancy remains controversial. The goal of this review is to provide an updated, evidence-based summary of LPD, including prevalence and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, and to explore the current controversies regarding progesterone supplementation for management and treatment of RPL. A literature review identified relevant research using a PubMed search, Cochrane summaries, review articles, textbook chapters, databases, and society guidelines. Endogenous progesterone plays a crucial role in the first trimester of pregnancy, and therefore, insufficiency may contribute to RPL. However, the precise relationship between LPD and RPL remains unclear. Luteal phase defect is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on a luteal phase less than 10 days. Although there may be a possibility of incorporating a combined clinical and biochemical approach in defining LPD, the current lack of validated diagnostic criteria creates a challenge for its routine incorporation in the workup of infertility. Moreover, no treatment modality has demonstrated efficacy in improving fertility outcomes for LPD patients, including progesterone supplementation, whose inconsistent data do not sufficiently support its routine use, despite its minimal risk. It is imperative that women diagnosed with LPD should be worked up for other potential conditions that may contribute to a shortened luteal phase. Future work needs to focus on identifying a reproducible diagnostic test for LPD to guide treatment. Currently, the perceived relationship between LPD and RPL is challenged by conflicting data. Therefore, patients with an abnormal luteal phase should undergo a thorough workup to address any other potential etiologies. Although supplemental progesterone is commonly utilized for treatment of LPD and RPL, inconsistent supporting data call for exogenous hormone therapy to be only used in a research setting or after a thorough discussion of its shortcomings.",['Collins LC; Gatta LA; Dotters-Katz SK; Kuller JA; Schust DJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38377455,a literature review identified relevant research using a PubMed search. the precise relationship between LPD and RPL remains unclear. a clinical diagnosis based on a luteal phase less than 10 days is a potential cause of recurrent pregnancy loss.
Worth a Shot: Experience and Lessons From an Unsuccessful Pediatric Immunization Quality Improvement Effort in a Large Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"During the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, routine childhood immunization rates dropped dramatically across the world, and the Military Health System (MHS) was no exception. In the MHS, which is a large, universally covered, low-to-no-cost health system, the immunization rates with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine remain below the rate necessary to prevent community transmission of measles. We aimed to improve childhood immunization rates in the MHS with an expansive quality improvement project. Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization rates served as proxy outcome measures for routine immunization rates tracked by the Center for Disease Control multi-immunization combination measures. The tracked measure was the percentage of 16- to 18-month olds and 6-year olds who had received MMR #1 and MMR #2, respectively. Various countermeasures were implemented throughout the study period, and standard quality improvement analyses informed the effect of countermeasures. By January 2023, the percentage of 16- to 18-month olds and 6-year olds who had received MMR #1 and MMR #2 was 85% and 91%, respectively, with no positive shift in immunization rates despite various countermeasures introduced during the study period. For reference, the MMR immunization rates of commercial health maintenance organization and commercial preferred provider organization for 24-month-old populations were 92% and 90.3%, respectively. On chart review, the most common cause for under-immunization (55%) was vaccine abandonment. MMR #1 rates rose to 92% in 24-month olds. Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization rates within the MHS remained below commercial health system rates and below public health standards required for herd immunity despite various countermeasures throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization rates increased with age, suggesting that children within the MHS eventually catch up despite potential barriers.",['Howard B; Gorman G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38935398,"routine childhood immunization rates dropped dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. the military health system was no exception in the large, universally covered, low-to-no-cost health system. the immunization rates with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine remain below the rate necessary to prevent community transmission of measles."
"Menstrual cycle characteristics, perceived impact on performance, and barriers to communication: Perspectives of high-performance adolescent athletes in Singapore.","The purpose of this study was to examine the menstrual cycle (MC) characteristics, explore the impact on performance, and identify barriers to and facilitators of MC-related communication among high-performance female adolescent athletes in Singapore. Ninety athletes (15.4 ± 1.8 years) from multiple sports completed an online questionnaire. Eighty-four athletes were postmenarcheal (menarcheal age 11.9 ± 1.3 years), including two who were using an oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Secondary amenorrhea, current or history of, was self-reported in 16% of athletes. Sixty-two percent and 67% of non-OCP athletes perceived that the MC affected their ability to train and compete, respectively. Athletes preferred speaking to a parent (85%) and a female figure (67%) about MC-related concerns. Through thematic analysis, three barriers to communication were constructed: (1) pervasive menstrual stigma, (2) constraints of the training environment, and (3) the low value placed on MC-related conversations. Two facilitators of communication were constructed: (1) respect athletes' individual experiences as menstruating girls and (2) foster a safe space for MC-related conversations. Findings demonstrated that menstrual irregularities are common in adolescent athletes and screening for MC disorders, particularly primary amenorrhea should be undertaken in this population, with clear support pathways for management including symptom mitigation. To support athletes in raising MC-related concerns when needed, structured communication pathways that consider individual preferences and involve a (female) point of contact should be established within the training environment. Improving menstrual health literacy among adolescent athletes before any misinformation or negative perceptions are firmly established may contribute to longevity in their athletic careers.",['Taim BC; Lye J; Suppiah HT; Chan TW; Chia M; Clarke A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37682006,"study examined menstrual cycle characteristics, perceived impact on performance, and barriers to communication among high-performance female adolescent athletes in Singapore. ninety athletes completed an online questionnaire. eighty-four athletes were postmenarcheal (menarcheal age 11.9  1.3 years), including two who were using an oral contraceptive pill (OCP) secondary amenorrhea, current or history of, was self-reported in 16% of athletes."
[Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder].,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.",['Kovács Z; Hegyi G; Szőke H'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35895486,"the physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life. symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. the diagnosis of PMS is determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis."
"A herbal treatment approach for the management of clinical, hormonal and ultrasound parameters in reproductive age group women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: A randomized clinical trial.","Around fifteen percent women of reproductive age have been effected by Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS); a complicated disorder; and apparently there is no standard therapy available. Considering this lack, we design present work; for the assessment of a herbal medicine (Femitex-SP<sub>4</sub>) in managing PCOs. During 2016-17; this study was carried out at Abbasi Shaheed hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 150 patients aged between 18-44 years were included as per Rotterdam criteria. Patients received 500 mg of powdered herbs in capsule form twice daily. The primary outcomes were regular menstruation and ovulation plus change in fasting blood sugar levels. Changes in free testosterone levels and ovarian morphology was secondary outcome measures. Continuous outcomes before and after treatment were compared by Student's t-test (one tailed, independent). P = 0.05 was considered as significant. Women menstrual cycle was considerably improved. Fasting blood sugar levels did not change (p=0.103392). Progesterone levels were same at the starting point and after treatment (P=0.318322). With complete recovery in 6 patients; a notable change was found in ovarian size. Free testosterone levels were also dropped significantly (p<0.00001). Our main success was drastic improvement in normalizing menstrual cycle during therapy. Herbal treatment is proven to be clinically effective in most of the patients; particularly PCOs patients with menstrual irregularities. Hence, Femitex-SP4 can be taken as a better treatment for PCOs.",['Ishaq S; H Rizwani G; Shareef H; Fatima S; Anser H; Sarfraz S'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34602438,"herbal treatment approach for management of clinical, hormonal and ultrasound parameters in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. around fifteen percent women of reproductive age have been effected by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS); apparently there is no standard therapy available."
New regimens with combined oral contraceptive pills--moving away from traditional 21/7 cycles.,The practice of extending combined oral contraceptive use (COC) and eliminating or reducing the hormone free interval has been in use for many years. More recently a range of products with new dosing options has been developed and marketed. Women and physicians in developed countries are comfortable with and many prefer the use of extended COC regimens which provide an option to eliminate or reduce the frequency of regular withdrawal bleeding. The extension of active pill taking and the reduction or elimination of the hormone-free interval have been shown to be beneficial for women who experience menstrual cycle-related problems such as heavy bleeding or dysmenorrhoea. The hormone-free interval of less than seven days has additional benefits in managing hormone withdrawal symptoms and efficacy may be improved in situations where pills are inadvertently missed or in women who are perceived as 'poor' pill takers. This paper provides a descriptive review highlighting the development of new dosing options that alter the traditional 21/7 COC regimen. The rationale for and the acceptability of COCs developed with alternative dosing regimens is examined.,['Read CM'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21091165,combined oral contraceptive use (COC) and eliminating or reducing the hormone free interval has been in use for many years. more recently a range of products with new dosing options has been developed and marketed.
Exploring the relationship between mothers' competence and comfort in sexual and reproductive health discourse with adolescent girls and its related factors.,"The mothers-adolescent discussion regarding sexual and reproductive health (SHR) issues plays an important role in preventing negative outcome associated with sexual risk behaviors. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between mothers' competence and comfort in SHR discourse with adolescent girls and its related factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 160 mothers from July to September 2020. Data were collected through questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, Mother's Comfort in Sexual Discourse (MCSD), Mother's Interest in Sexual Discourse (MISD), and Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC). The collected data were analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression models. The mean scores for MCSD, MISD, and PSOC were 45.49±16.15 (13-78), 7.9±4.2 (0-13), and 64.07±9.44 (45-94), respectively. The primary topics of mother-adolescent discourse on SRH were menstruation (5.61±0.98) and the delivery process (4.55±1.57). The mean age for ""sex talks"" and age-appropriate ""sex talks"" with daughters was 11.76±1.85 (range: 6-15) and 17.05±1.86 (range: 14-23) years, respectively. Significant associations were found between MCSD and MISD (β=0.482, p<0.0001), PSOC (β=0.223, p<0.005), self-efficacy (β=0.202, p<0.011), mother's job (β=0.185, p<0.019), mother's education (β=0.173, p<0.029), and father's age (β=0.161, p<0.042). After adjusting for other variables, major influencing factors on MCSD included MISD (β=0.487, p<0.0001), self-efficacy (β=0.143, p<0.039), satisfaction (β=0.169, p<0.015), daughter number (β=-0.235, p<0.014), son number (β=-0.219, p<0.024), birth rank (β=0.263, p<0.008), and residency (β=0.172, p<0.014).

Association between COVID-19 vaccination and menstruation: a state of the science review.,"Menstrual health is a key patient-reported outcome beyond its importance as a general indicator of health and fertility. However, menstrual function was not measured in the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. The purpose of this review was to synthesise the existing literature on the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual health outcomes. A PubMed search to 31 October 2023 identified a total of 53 publications: 11 prospective cohort studies, 11 retrospective cohort studies or registry-based cohort studies, and 31 cross-sectional or retrospective case-control studies. Identified studies were generally at moderate-to-high risk of bias due to retrospective design, interviewer bias, and failure to include a non-vaccinated control group. Nonetheless, the bulk of the literature demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccine is associated with temporary changes in menstrual characteristics (cycle length and flow) and menstrual pain. Follicular phase (at the time of vaccination) is associated with greater increases in cycle length. Evidence suggests temporary post-vaccine menstrual changes in adolescents, abnormal vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal individuals, and a potential protective effect of using hormonal contraception. In this review we found evidence supporting an association between the COVID-19 vaccine and menstrual health outcomes. Given the importance of menstrual function to overall health, we recommend that all future vaccine trials include menstruation as a study outcome. Future vaccine studies should include rigorous assessment of the menstrual cycle as an outcome variable to limit sources of bias, identify biological mechanisms, and elucidate the impact of stress.",['Payne LA; Wise LA; Wesselink AK; Wang S; Missmer SA; Edelman A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38857991,menstrual function was not measured in the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. the aim of this review was to synthesise the existing literature on the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual health outcomes.
Assessment of knowledge of the new pregnancy and lactation labeling rule among pharmacists and physicians in Saudi Arabia.,"Researchers in Saudi Arabia conducted this study to determine the level of familiarity that pharmacists and physicians possess with the pregnancy and lactation labeling rules established by the Food and Drug Administration. The present study included a cross-sectional survey conducted among pharmacists and physicians working in Saudi Arabia. The sample size was determined using the Rao sample size calculator. We utilized the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 for our analysis. A total of 122 respondents completed the study. Among them, 72.9% were aged between 25 and 44 years, and approximately 63.9% were male. About 64% of the respondents indicated familiarity with the A, B, C, D, and X letter system of pregnancy category labeling. Over 37% stated that the new pregnancy and lactation labeling rule would continue to use the lettering system. Additionally, 83% believed that the A, B, C, D, and X risk category labeling system is a useful resource, and 82% believed that working with this risk category labeling improves patient care. The study revealed that pharmacists and physicians exhibited good knowledge of the old rule but a low level of knowledge regarding the new rule. Despite significant flaws in the old system, most preferred it. Enhancing knowledge in this area is crucial for improving risk communication and the quality of care for women of reproductive age.",['Alem G; Ahmed N; Aldurayhim H; Almukhaizeem R; Almalki Z; Alshehri A; Alahmari A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39121290,"study was conducted by researchers in Saudi Arabia. 122 pharmacists and physicians in the study completed the study. 72.9% were aged between 25 and 44 years, and approximately 63.9% were male."
Quasi-1D Moiré superlattices in self-twisted two-allotropic antimonene heterostructures.,"Two-dimensional heterostructures, characterized by a twist angle between individual sublayers, offer unique and tunable properties distinct from standalone layers. These structures typically introduce a realm of exotic quantum phenomena due to the appearance of new, long range periodicities associated with Moiré superlattices. Using molecular beam epitaxy, we demonstrate the growth of bi-allotropic 2D-Sb heterostructures on a W(110) substrate composed of twisted α (α-Sb) and β (β-Sb) phases of antimonene. Due to the relatively weak interaction between sublayers, the twist angle is intrinsically determined for each heterostructure, revealing its inherent self-twisted nature. The different atomic lattice symmetries of both allotropes lead to the formation of distinctive quasi-1D Moiré superlattices, while the random nature of the twist angle allows for a wide modulation of the Moiré potential landscape.

Side-chain-engineered fluorescent dyes for 3D and long-term dynamic tracking of the plasma membrane in living cells.,"The plasma membrane involves in many important biological events such as cell fusion and programmed cell death, but most of current plasma membrane probes cannot meet the requirement of long-term specific anchoring to the plasma membrane. Herein, we propose a molecular side-chain engineering strategy to modulate the long-term imaging performance of fluorescent dyes to the plasma membrane by regulating the cell permeability and anchoring ability. A series of FMR dyes with different lengths of side chains were designed and synthesized, and their transmembrane behaviours and staining performance were evaluated in living HeLa cells. We found that short-chain and medium-chain FMR dyes have excellent cell permeability without the labeling ability to the plasma membrane while the long-chain FMR dyes specifically stain the plasma membrane and can be firmly anchored to the plasma membrane for a long period of time. These long-chain FMR dyes have high stain specificality to the plasma membrane, and C10-FMR can be anchored to the plasma membrane of living cells for 2 h, which enables it to continuously monitor dynamic changes of the plasma membrane. The three-dimensional precision imaging of various cells was achieved using C10-FMR, which provides an opportunity to obtain complete information on the three-dimensional spatial morphology of the plasma membrane. The PEG-induced cell fusion of chicken red blood cells and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells were monitored by real-time tracking of dynamic changes of the plasma membrane during these processes, which provide solid examples to prove the usefulness of these fluorescent dyes as long-term imaging tools. This work validates the hypothesis that cell permeability of membrane dyes can be readily regulated by tuning the side chains, and provides the effective design strategy of fluorescent dyes for 3D and long-term dynamic tracking of the plasma membrane of diverse animal cells.",['Yao C; Peng A; Wu P; Zuo J; Pan J; Kong C; Qian Z; Jin Z; Feng H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053364,fluorescent dyes have high stain specificality to the plasma membrane. the dyes can be anchored to the plasma membrane for 2 h. the dyes are designed to monitor dynamic changes of the plasma membrane.
The late-follicular-phase progesterone to retrieved oocytes ratio in normal ovarian responders treated with an antagonist protocol can be used as an index for selecting an embryo transfer strategy and predicting the success rate: a retrospective large-scale study.,"To determine whether the late-follicular-phase progesterone to retrieved oocytes (P/O) ratio during <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) impacts pregnancy outcomes. 12,874 cycles were retrospectively categorized into four groups according to the P/O ratio percentile, with divisions at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rates of fresh cycle embryos in Group D were significantly lower than those in the other three groups (45.1% and 39.0%, 43.2% and 37.2%, 39.6% and 33.5%, 33.4% and 28.2% in Group A, B, C, D, respectively; both P < 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the P/O ratio and live birth, particularly when the P/O ratio was ≥0.22 (OR = 0.862, 95% CI [0.774-0.959], P = 0.006).

Measuring Real-World Talk Time and Locations of People With Aphasia Using Wearable Technology.,"Measuring real-world communication participation of individuals with aphasia is complicated. Historically, this has been estimated through subjective participant or proxy self-report. To address potential inaccuracies, objective measures such as ""talk time"" have been proposed. Although promising, technological barriers to collecting and quantifying everyday conversations have been documented (e.g., background noise interference, differentiating recorded speakers, and operating Bluetooth applications). This study explored the use of a novel laryngeal sensor and a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker with the objective of measuring mean talk time per hour and participant locations across three 8-hr days. Sixteen participants utilized a wearable laryngeal sensor that captures physiological mechano-acoustic signals wirelessly, without recording speech content. The sensor differentiates speech from other laryngeal movements associated with swallowing and coughing. A GPS tracker was also issued to track daily locations. Semistructured interviews regarding feasibility and acceptability were conducted with participants at the end of the data collection period. Across all participants, laryngeal sensor data were collected for a total of 38 days and GPS data for a total of 43 days, with a mean collection period of 8.21 hr (<i>SD</i> = 1.38) per day. Mean talk time per hour was 56.46 s (<i>SD</i> = 35.27). Participants were tracked at a mean of 2.09 locations daily (range: 1-6). Participants reported the devices were relatively comfortable to wear and easy to use. Preliminary findings indicated that talk time of individuals with aphasia is limited, though variable. Higher fluency ratings were related to greater mean talk time per hour and locations tracked. Results suggest wearable technology is feasible to use and acceptable to people with aphasia. In the future, wearable devices may offer innovative ways to measure communication participation. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26237531.",['Kinsey LE; Cherney LR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39073093,participants used a wearable laryngeal sensor to measure mean talk time per hour. the sensor differentiates speech from other laryngeal movements associated with swallowing and coughing. participants were tracked at 8.21 hr (i>SD/i> = 35.27) per day.
Uterine bleeding: how understanding endometrial physiology underpins menstrual health.,"Menstruation is a physiological process that is typically uncomplicated. However, up to one third of women globally will be affected by abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) at some point in their reproductive years. Menstruation (that is, endometrial shedding) is a fine balance between proliferation, decidualization, inflammation, hypoxia, apoptosis, haemostasis, vasoconstriction and, finally, repair and regeneration. An imbalance in any one of these processes can lead to the abnormal endometrial phenotype of AUB. Poor menstrual health has a negative impact on a person's physical, mental, social, emotional and financial well-being. On a global scale, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia are closely linked with AUB, and are often under-reported and under-recognized. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics have produced standardized terminology and a classification system for the causes of AUB. This standardization will facilitate future research endeavours, diagnosis and clinical management. In a field where no new medications have been developed for over 20 years, emerging technologies are paving the way for a deeper understanding of the biology of the endometrium in health and disease, as well as opening up novel diagnostic and management avenues.",['Jain V; Chodankar RR; Maybin JA; Critchley HOD'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35136207,"menstruation is a fine balance between proliferation, decidualization, inflammation, hypoxia, apoptosis, haemostasis, vasoconstriction and repair and regeneration. iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia are closely linked with AUB."
The Role of the General Practitioner in Evaluation and Treatment of Girls with Menstrual-Related Complaints.,"A common scenario a pediatrician or general practitioner may encounter in the care of adolescent girls is menstrual concerns. A frequent complaint may be of irregular periods that may be coming twice a month or possibly only every other month. Sometimes the teenage patient may complain of heavy bleeding or prolonged periods lasting longer than 7 days. The typical patient with this complaint could be a 14-year-old girl with periods that started at age 13 years who has had no periods for 3 months after onset of menarche. However, once the second period comes, the patient complains of periods happening often, lasting for 5 days, and with the need to change feminine products about 3 times per day. She is otherwise healthy with no medical issues and no surgeries. The family may question if this is considered normal or if something is potentially wrong with the adolescent's pubertal development. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(5):e187-e189.].",['Dawson R'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31067332,adolescent girls may complain of irregular periods that may be coming twice a month or only every other month. the typical patient with this complaint could be a 14-year-old girl with periods that started at age 13 years.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea.,"Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs that act by blocking prostaglandin production. They inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. More selective NSAIDs that solely target COX-2 enzymes (COX-2-specific inhibitors) were launched in 1999 with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. To determine the effectiveness and safety of NSAIDs in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. We searched the following databases in January 2015: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, November 2014 issue), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We checked the abstracts of major scientific meetings and the reference lists of relevant articles. All randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of NSAIDs versus placebo, other NSAIDs or paracetamol, when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data, calculating odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used inverse variance methods to combine data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women). They compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs versus placeboAmong women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I(2) = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so.However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I(2) = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs versus other NSAIDsWhen NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety. However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials. Non-selective NSAIDs versus COX-2-specific selectorsOnly two of the included studies utilised COX-2-specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib). There was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty. NSAIDs versus paracetamolNSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty.Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%); a further 31% failed to state their source of funding. NSAIDs appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk of adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the safest and most effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.",['Marjoribanks J; Ayeleke RO; Farquhar C; Proctor M'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224322,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs act by blocking prostaglandin production. they inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) which is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
Time - The fourth dimension of immune cells.,"Deciphering the intricate cell-state transitions orchestrating immune adaptation over time stands as a cornerstone for advancing biological understanding. However, the lack of empirical in vivo genomic technologies capable of capturing cellular dynamics has posed a significant challenge. In response to this gap, a groundbreaking study introduces Zman-seq, a single-cell technology that records transcriptomic dynamics across time by incorporating time stamps into circulating immune cells, enabling their tracking in tissues for extended periods. The application of Zman-seq in glioblastoma research has successfully unraveled the cell state and molecular trajectories underlying the dysfunctional immune microenvironment. Understanding the temporal aspects of cell-state transitions during immune responses is pivotal for advancing our knowledge in biology. The emergence of Zman-seq addresses the current limitations in empirical in vivo genomic technologies, offering a revolutionary approach to studying the dynamics of immune cells over time. This highlight comprehensively explores the implications of Zman-seq in resolving cell-state transitions and molecular trajectories within the dysfunctional immune microenvironment in different types of immunotherapy. This technique has particular potential for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, overriding drug resistance, clinical medication optimization, and facilitating drug development. In particular, this article discusses potential strategies for improving the efficacy of clinical treatments.",['Li G; Zhang W; Yang J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105196,"a groundbreaking study introduces Zman-seq, a single-cell technology that records transcriptomic dynamics across time by incorporating time stamps into circulating immune cells. the application of Zman-seq in glioblastoma research has successfully unraveled the cell state and molecular trajectories underlying the dysfunctional immune microenvironment."
Association between Perinatal Outcomes and Maternal Risk Factors: A Cohort Study.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The aim of this study was to analyze the association between maternal risk factors, such as age, body mass index (BMI), and cigarette smoking, and perinatal outcomes. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We conducted a retrospective analysis based on prospectively collected data at Hospital Universitario de Torrejón (Madrid, Spain) between September 2017 and December 2019. All pregnant women with singleton pregnancies and non-malformed live fetuses attending their routine ultrasound examination at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks' gestation were invited to participate. The association between preeclampsia, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) or fetal-growth-restricted (FGR) neonates, and type of delivery and maternal age, BMI, and cigarette smoking was studied. Logistic mixed models were used to analyze the data. <i>Results</i>: A total of 1921 patients were included in the analysis. Women who were ≥40 years old had a significantly higher risk of having GDM (odds ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.36) and SGA neonates (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.37). Women with a BMI < 18 had an increased rate of giving birth to SGA and FGR neonates (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.05, and OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.54 to 8.37, respectively), whereas women with a BMI ≥ 35 had a higher risk of GDM (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.89). Smoking increased the risk of having SGA and FGR neonates (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.46, and OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.78). <i>Conclusions</i>: Advanced maternal age, low or high BMI, and smoking status are significant risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both clinicians and society should concentrate their efforts on addressing these factors to enhance reproductive health.",['Martin-Alonso R; Prieto P; Fernández-Buhigas I; German-Fernandez C; Aramburu C; Piqueras V; Cuenca-Gomez D; Ferrer E; Rolle V; Santacruz B; Gil MM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064500,"association between maternal risk factors, such as age, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, and perinatal outcomes was studied. a total of 1921 patients were included in the analysis."
PERINATAL CARDIAC FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATION IN HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME: A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS.,"The perinatal transition is characterized by acute changes in cardiac loading. Compared to normal newborn combined cardiac output (CCO), single right ventricular (RV) output of neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is markedly greater. We sought to examine the mechanisms of cardiac adaptation which facilitate this perinatal transition from late fetal to early neonatal life in HLHS. Prospectively recruited pregnancies complicated by fetal HLHS (n=35) and health controls (Ctrl, n=17) underwent serial echocardiography in late gestation (38±1weeks) and 6, 24 and 48 hours after birth. Cardiac function was assessed using conventional, tissue Doppler and speckle tracking echocardiography. Term HLHS fetuses had an RV output (RVCO) comparable to Ctrl CCO via higher stroke volume (SV). Compared to both left ventricular (LV) and RV indices of Ctrls, they exhibited a globular and dilated RV with reduced relative wall thickness (RWT) [RWT: 0.40±0.08 vs. 0.49±0.10, p<0.01], increased Tei index' [HLHS vs. Ctrl LV/Ctrl RV: sphericity index (SI): 0.9±0.25 vs. 0.5±0.10/0.6±0.11, RV area index: 28±6cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 15±3cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/17±5cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, Tei index': 0.65±0.11 vs. 0.43±0.07/0.45±0.09, all p<0.0001]. HLHS neonates generated elevated RVCO compared to Ctrl CCO via higher heart rate and SV, with further RV dilatation, increased longitudinal systolic strain at 48h [-17±4% vs. -14±3%/-14±5%] with reduced circumferential and rotational myocardial deformation and altered diastolic function. HLHS neonates also demonstrated right atrial (RA) enlargement with increased longitudinal strain: 6h (33±12% vs. 26±6%), 24h (37±15% vs. 26±13%), 48h (38±11% vs. 24±13%), p<0.0001. Term HLHS fetuses exhibit altered RV geometry and RV systolic and diastolic functional parameters. After birth, further alterations in these cardiac parameters likely reflect adaptation to acutely altered RV loading from increasing cardiac output and pulmonary artery flow demands.",['Patey O; Hornberger LK; McBrien A; Lin L; Khoo NS; Eckersley L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38997074,"perinatal transition is characterized by acute changes in cardiac loading. compared to normal newborn combined cardiac output (CCO), single right ventricular output of neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is markedly greater."
[Menstrual experiences and acceptability of a menstrual equity intervention among adolescents in Catalonia (Spain)].,"To explore menstrual knowledge, menstrual management, the use of menstrual products, the prevalence of menstrual poverty and to assess the acceptability of a menstrual equity intervention among students in the fourth grade of compulsory secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). Post-intervention mixed-methods study (cross-sectional study and qualitative study with focus groups) with a critical and gender perspective. It was conducted between July 2022 and March 2023. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analyses stratified by gender were carried out. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Women and people who menstruate rated the intervention favourably, while some men were reluctant. The intervention promoted the use of some reusable menstrual products, although some barriers to use menstrual cups were identified. Participants reported institutional barriers to menstrual management in the school setting and 19.4% stopped attending school during menstruation in the 6 months prior to the study. Between 10.9-16.4% reported menstrual poverty in the 6 months prior to the study, and 29,0% took actions to reduce the environmental impact of menstrual products. This study highlights the need for co-designing menstrual interventions that consider gender dynamics and sexist attitudes with students, as well as targeting it to teachers. The provision of reusable menstrual products can be helpful in promoting their use, although accompaniment should be provided. In parallel, it is crucial to strengthen menstrual education, as well as to reduce menstrual poverty and school absenteeism during menstruation.",['García-Egea A; López-Jiménez T; Jacques-Aviñó C; Morero Beltrán AM; Pi Sánchez A; Martínez-Bueno C; Carrilero-Carrió N; Berenguera A; Medina-Perucha L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39047371,"post-intervention mixed-methods study conducted between July 2022 and march 2023. women and men who menstruate rated the intervention favourably, while some men were reluctant. intervention promoted the use of some reusable menstrual products."
Premenstrual symptoms across the lifespan in an international sample: data from a mobile application.,"Premenstrual symptoms, including physical and mood symptoms, affect a large proportion of women worldwide. Data on premenstrual symptoms across nations and age groups is limited. In the present study, we leveraged a large international dataset to explore patterns in premenstrual symptom frequency with age. A survey was administered to users of the Flo mobile application (app), aged 18 to 55. The survey queried app users about a range of premenstrual symptoms. Respondents were asked whether they experienced each symptom every menstrual cycle, some cycles, or never. Age was also captured and categorized as 18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-55. Data was summarized and Pearson's chi square test for count data assessed differences in symptom frequency by age group. A sample of 238,114 app users from 140 countries responded to the survey. The most common symptoms reported were food cravings (85.28%), mood swings or anxiety (64.18%), and fatigue (57.3%). Absentmindedness, low libido, sleep changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight gain, headaches, sweating or hot flashes, fatigue, hair changes, rashes, and swelling were significantly more frequent with increasing age (p's &lt; 0.001). Mood swings and anxiety did not vary by age group. Of the respondents, 28.61% reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered with their everyday life each menstrual cycle. In a large international sample, the majority of women reported premenstrual food cravings, mood changes, and fatigue every menstrual cycle. Mood symptoms did not vary by age group, suggesting that premenstrual mood changes are a persistent issue among women of reproductive age.",['Hantsoo L; Rangaswamy S; Voegtline K; Salimgaraev R; Zhaunova L; Payne JL'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36018464,"data on premenstrual symptoms across nations and age groups is limited. a survey was administered to users of the Flo mobile application (app) aged 18 to 55. respondents were asked whether they experienced each symptom every menstrual cycle, some cycles, or never."
Considerations for the use of progestin-only contraceptives.,"To highlight the characteristics of progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) currently available in the United States, and to explore the potential of these agents as first-line contraceptive options for women seeking health promotion by prevention of an unwanted pregnancy. The progestin-only pills (Micronor and Ovrette), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections (Depo-Provera and depo-subQ provera 104), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) (Mirena), and etonogestrel implant (Implanon) will be reviewed. The use of levonorgestrel (Plan B) as an emergency contraceptive will also be considered briefly. Worldwide medical literature and the prescribing information for the specified products. A number of POCs are currently available for routine birth control in the United States, ranging from the daily progestin-only pill to nondaily contraceptive options such as injectable DMPA, the levonorgestrel-releasing IUS, and the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant. Each of these methods has specific advantages, but also specific drawbacks that can result in discontinuation of treatment if users are not given adequate information about what to expect in terms of side effects. It is critical that clinicians provide adequate and accurate information along with detailed counseling to women who are considering using POCs, as well as providing periodic reinforcement of the information at regular clinic visits for those already using POCs. Given that a large number of pregnancies are unplanned and create a significant impact on social, economic, and health outcomes, it is important for the clinician to have a vast knowledge of contraceptive options. POCs offer significant choices in contraception. By proactively addressing common concerns (such as potential effects on weight, mood, menstrual bleeding patterns, and bone mineral density), clinicians may improve the likelihood of adherence and continuation with POCs for routine birth control.",['Freeman S; Shulman LP'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20132366,the progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) are currently available in the united states. the use of levonorgestrel (Plan B) as an emergency contraceptive will also be considered briefly.
Interannual site fidelity by Svalbard walruses.,"The Arctic is experiencing rapid reductions in sea ice, affecting all ice-dependant species. In the present study we examine interannual seasonal movements and habitat use in relation to sea ice coverage for one of the Arctic endemic marine mammals. We tagged 40 male walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) in the Svalbard Archipelago with custom-designed tusk-mounted GPS loggers. Twelve of these animals provided tracks that lasted 1-6 years. Eleven of the walruses displayed clear seasonal migratory behaviour between summer foraging areas and winter breeding areas. Individuals showed high inter-individual variation, but clear site fidelity, using the same areas in consecutive years despite variable sea ice conditions. The walruses swam 5225-10,406 km per year and travelled remarkably similar distances between years on an individual basis. The phenology of migration was not impacted by sea ice concentrations or daylight length but was consistent at the individual level, suggesting endogenous drivers. Sea ice concentrations influenced movement behaviour with animals showing more tortuous paths when in areas with heavy sea ice, possibly searching for polynyas where females reside. Ongoing climate change is expected to drastically change walrus habitat, and it remains to be seen if walruses will be able to shift from their fixed seasonal migratory routines.",['Mikkelsen L; Kovacs KM; Blanchet MA; Brodin G; Lydersen C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38982120,"the Arctic is experiencing rapid reductions in sea ice. the walruses swam 5225-10,406 km per year."
"Being highly sensitive person negatively impacts on cognitive and psychosocial fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients: A cross-sectional, monocenter study.","Fatigue is a common symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but its determinants are not clarified yet. Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is a personality trait characterized by enhanced sensitivity towards endogenous and exogenous stimuli, and higher attention toward minimal stimuli, resulting in overarousal and fatigue. to evaluate the association between SPS and fatigue in MS patients. 192 consecutive MS patients (age of 43.3 ± 12.1 years; females 67.2 %; median EDSS of 2.5 (0 - 7)) underwent clinical (EDSS, age, gender), cognitive (BICAMS, Trial Making Test [TMT]), psychosocial (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Modified Fatigue Impact Scale [MFIS]) and sensitivity evaluation (Highly Sensitive Person [HSP]Scale). Patients were classified as HSP if the score was greater than 14. A stepwise regression model was applied to explore association between SPS and MFIS total scores and sub-scores, by accounting for age, gender, education, EDSS, Cerebral FS scores, TMT-Part A and part B scores, BAI, BDI, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Total HSP was 17.2 ± 6.8 and 129 patients (67 %) were classified as highly sensitive persons (HSP). HSP patients were more female patients (p = 0.02) with a longer disease duration (p = 0.03). HSP people showed higher total MFIS score (27.6 ± 20.6 vs 13.2 ± 14.1, p < 0.001), higher physical MFIS score (p < 0.001), higher cognitive MFIS score (p < 0.001), higher psychosocial MFIS score (p < 0.001) vs non-HSP patients. Higher total MFIS was associated with SPS trait (coeff. 6.9, p = 0.006). Specifically, SPS trait was associated with higher cognitive MFIS (coeff. 5.3, p < 0.001) and higher psychosocial MFIS (coeff. 0.7, p = 0.02). SPS was associated with fatigue. Since SPS could be easily and quickly assessed in clinical settings, SPS could unveil a higher propensity of a patient toward fatigue occurrence over the disease course and could provide hints for possible preventive cognitive behavior therapy.",['Falco F; Lamagna F; Esposito A; Eliano M; Spiezia AL; Petracca M; Caliendo D; Moccia M; Lanzillo R; Brescia Morra V; Carotenuto A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39067188,"192 consecutive MS patients underwent clinical (EDSS, age, gender), cognitive (BICAMS, Trial Making Test [TMT], psychosocial (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Modified Fatigue Impact Scale [MFIS]) and sensitivity evaluation (highly Sensitive Person [HSP]Scale)"
The Course of Minipuberty in Daughters of Women with Low Gestational Vitamin D Status.,"Minipuberty is a term describing temporary, sex-specific activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is implicated in the development of male and female genital organs. Sons of women with low vitamin D during gestation were found to be characterized by increased activity of the reproductive axis and faster postnatal growth of genital organs. The current study assesses for the first time the course of minipuberty in female descendants of women with a vitamin D deficit. The study population included three matched groups of infant girls: children born to women with vitamin D deficiency (25OHD concentration below 50 nmol/L), offspring of women with vitamin D insufficiency (25OHD concentration between 50 and 75 nmol/L), and daughters of healthy females (25OHD concentration between 75 and 150 nmol/L). Salivary concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens, as well as urine concentrations of FSH and LH, were assayed during the first 18 months of life (once a month in the first 6 months, bimonthly between months 6 and 12, and then every three months). At each visit, beyond hormone measurements, the investigators assessed the size of reproductive organs: ovaries, uterus and breasts. In daughters of mothers with vitamin D deficiency, concentrations of FSH, LH and estradiol were higher and detectable for a longer period of time, while ovarian volume, uterine length and breast diameter were greater than in the remaining groups. Children born to women with vitamin D insufficiency were characterized by higher FSH levels than daughters of healthy females, though the detection period was the same, and both groups differed in breast diameter. These findings suggest that low vitamin D status during gestation leads to more pronounced and longer-lasting activation of the reproductive axis, and is associated with increased dimensions of sexual organs, the magnitude of which depends on the degree of vitamin D deficit.",['Kowalcze K; Krysiak R; Gullo G; Ott J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064805,the course of minipuberty was assessed for the first time in female descendants of women with a vitamin D deficit. the study population included three matched groups of infant girls.
Global prevalence of norovirus gastroenteritis after emergence of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Norovirus is widely recognized as a leading cause of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) across all age groups. The GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant has consistently prevailed since 2012, distinguishing itself from other variants that typically circulate for a period of 2-4 years. This review aims to systematically summarize the prevalence of norovirus gastroenteritis following emergence of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant. Data were collected from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases spanning the period between January 2012 and August 2022. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the global prevalence and distribution patterns of norovirus gastroenteritis from 2012 to 2022. The global pooled prevalence of norovirus gastroenteritis was determined to be 19.04% (16.66-21.42%) based on a comprehensive analysis of 70 studies, which included a total of 85,798 sporadic cases with acute gastroenteritis and identified 15,089 positive cases for norovirus. The prevalence rate is higher in winter than other seasons, and there are great differences among countries and age groups. The pooled attack rate of norovirus infection is estimated to be 36.89% (95% CI, 36.24-37.55%), based on a sample of 6,992 individuals who tested positive for norovirus out of a total population of 17,958 individuals exposed during outbreak events. The global prevalence of norovirus gastroenteritis is always high, necessitating an increased emphasis on prevention and control strategies with vaccine development for this infectious disease, particularly among the children under 5 years old and the geriatric population (individuals over 60 years old).",['Zhang P; Hao C; Di X; Chuizhao X; Jinsong L; Guisen Z; Hui L; Zhaojun D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38993708,norovirus is widely recognized as a leading cause of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) across all age groups. the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant has consistently prevailed since 2012.
Investigating trends in those who experience menstrual bleeding changes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,"Early in 2021, many people began sharing that they experienced unexpected menstrual bleeding after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. We investigated this emerging phenomenon of changed menstrual bleeding patterns among a convenience sample of currently and formerly menstruating people using a web-based survey. In this sample, 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual, while 44% reported no change after being vaccinated. Among respondents who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting reversible contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones, and 66% of postmenopausal people reported breakthrough bleeding. We found that increased/breakthrough bleeding was significantly associated with age, systemic vaccine side effects (fever and/or fatigue), history of pregnancy or birth, and ethnicity. Generally, changes to menstrual bleeding are not uncommon or dangerous, yet attention to these experiences is necessary to build trust in medicine.",['Lee KMN; Junkins EJ; Luo C; Fatima UA; Cox ML; Clancy KBH'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35857495,study looked at changes in menstrual bleeding patterns in convenience sample. 42% of menstruating people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual. 44% reported no change after being vaccinated.
The World Health Organization Fetal Growth Charts: A Multinational Longitudinal Study of Ultrasound Biometric Measurements and Estimated Fetal Weight.,"Perinatal mortality and morbidity continue to be major global health challenges strongly associated with prematurity and reduced fetal growth, an issue of further interest given the mounting evidence that fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common noncommunicable diseases in adulthood. Against this background, WHO made it a high priority to provide the present fetal growth charts for estimated fetal weight (EFW) and common ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide use. We conducted a multinational prospective observational longitudinal study of fetal growth in low-risk singleton pregnancies of women of high or middle socioeconomic status and without known environmental constraints on fetal growth. Centers in ten countries (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, and Thailand) recruited participants who had reliable information on last menstrual period and gestational age confirmed by crown-rump length measured at 8-13 wk of gestation. Participants had anthropometric and nutritional assessments and seven scheduled ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. Fifty-two participants withdrew consent, and 1,387 participated in the study. At study entry, median maternal age was 28 y (interquartile range [IQR] 25-31), median height was 162 cm (IQR 157-168), median weight was 61 kg (IQR 55-68), 58% of the women were nulliparous, and median daily caloric intake was 1,840 cal (IQR 1,487-2,222). The median pregnancy duration was 39 wk (IQR 38-40) although there were significant differences between countries, the largest difference being 12 d (95% CI 8-16). The median birthweight was 3,300 g (IQR 2,980-3,615). There were differences in birthweight between countries, e.g., India had significantly smaller neonates than the other countries, even after adjusting for gestational age. Thirty-one women had a miscarriage, and three fetuses had intrauterine death. The 8,203 sets of ultrasound measurements were scrutinized for outliers and leverage points, and those measurements taken at 14 to 40 wk were selected for analysis. A total of 7,924 sets of ultrasound measurements were analyzed by quantile regression to establish longitudinal reference intervals for fetal head circumference, biparietal diameter, humerus length, abdominal circumference, femur length and its ratio with head circumference and with biparietal diameter, and EFW. There was asymmetric distribution of growth of EFW: a slightly wider distribution among the lower percentiles during early weeks shifted to a notably expanded distribution of the higher percentiles in late pregnancy. Male fetuses were larger than female fetuses as measured by EFW, but the disparity was smaller in the lower quantiles of the distribution (3.5%) and larger in the upper quantiles (4.5%). Maternal age and maternal height were associated with a positive effect on EFW, particularly in the lower tail of the distribution, of the order of 2% to 3% for each additional 10 y of age of the mother and 1% to 2% for each additional 10 cm of height. Maternal weight was associated with a small positive effect on EFW, especially in the higher tail of the distribution, of the order of 1.0% to 1.5% for each additional 10 kg of bodyweight of the mother. Parous women had heavier fetuses than nulliparous women, with the disparity being greater in the lower quantiles of the distribution, of the order of 1% to 1.5%, and diminishing in the upper quantiles. There were also significant differences in growth of EFW between countries. In spite of the multinational nature of the study, sample size is a limiting factor for generalization of the charts. This study provides WHO fetal growth charts for EFW and common ultrasound biometric measurements, and shows variation between different parts of the world.",['Kiserud T; Piaggio G; Carroli G; Widmer M; Carvalho J; Neerup Jensen L; Giordano D; Cecatti JG; Abdel Aleem H; Talegawkar SA; Benachi A; Diemert A; Tshefu Kitoto A; Thinkhamrop J; Lumbiganon P; Tabor A; Kriplani A; Gonzalez Perez R; Hecher K; Hanson MA; Gülmezoglu AM; Platt LD'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118360,fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common noncommunicable diseases in adulthood. fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common noncommunicable diseases in adulthood.
Menstrual hygiene management amongst schoolgirls in the Rukungiri district of Uganda and the impact on their education: a cross-sectional study.,"An increasing number of studies have found that girls in low-income settings miss or struggle at school during menstruation if they are unable to manage their menstrual hygiene effectively. This study explores the menstrual hygiene practices and knowledge of girls at rural government primary schools in the Rukungiri district in Uganda and assesses the extent to which poor menstrual hygiene management (MHM) affects their education. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by schoolgirls in six government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district. Focus groups were held with girls from each school and semi-structured interviews were conducted with headteachers and female teachers from the participating schools. A toilet assessment was also conducted in each school. One hundred and forty schoolgirls completed the questionnaire. The girls reported a lack of access to adequate resources, facilities and accurate information to manage their menstrual hygiene effectively at school. They reported that, as a result, during menstruation they often struggle at school or miss school. Eighty-six girls (61.7%) reported missing school each month for menstrual-related reasons (mean 1.64, range 0-10, SD. 1.84). It is common for girls who attend government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district to miss school or struggle in lessons during menstruation because they do not have access to the resources, facilities, or information they need to manage for effective MHM. This is likely to have detrimental effects on their education and future prospects. A large-scale study is needed to explore the extent of this issue.",['Boosey R; Prestwich G; Deave T'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25852796,study explores menstrual hygiene management amongst schoolgirls in the Rukungiri district in the country. girls in low-income settings miss or struggle at school during menstruation.
Translation and psychometric evaluation of the Korean version of the Reproductive Concerns After Cancer Scale (RCAC).,"Improving cancer survival rates highlights post-treatment fertility implications for reproductive-aged women. To provide fertility care for cancer survivors, nurses need instruments to assess and communicate reproductive concerns with cancer survivors and healthcare providers. This study aimed to translate the Reproductive Concerns after Cancer Scale (RCAC) into Korean and examine its psychometric properties in young female cancer survivors in South Korea. The RCAC was translated into Korean, involving expert bilingual translators for initial translation and reverse translation for cultural and semantic accuracy. In detail, the RCAC was translated into Korean and evaluated in a preliminary study involving 10 cancer survivors. Subsequently, a revised version of the instrument was administered to 182 cancer survivors and a psychometric evaluation was conducted. The process included verifying content validity, and then assessing construct validity using exploratory factor analysis and criterion validity. The reliability of the instrument was quantified by measuring its internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. The translated RCAC demonstrated an item-level content validity index of 1.0 and a scale-level index of 1.0. The content was finalized based on preliminary survey findings, which revealed that all participants thought the instrument was clear. The Korean version of the RCAC demonstrated a satisfactory level of validity per exploratory factor analysis, which resulted in a 14-item instrument consisting of three subscales: ""fertility potential"" (six items), ""health problem"" (five items), and ""acceptance"" (three items). The items and subscales explained 57.6% of the variance. Criterion validity was confirmed through an analysis of the correlation between the Korean version of the RCAC and both the FACT-G (r = -0.36, p < .001) and PHQ-9 (r = 0.38, p < .001). Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the Korean version of the RCAC was 0.83. The Korean version of the RCAC is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing reproductive concerns in female cancer survivors. Thus, this instrument can be used to provide tailored care to female cancer survivors of reproductive age by clarifying and assess their reproductive concerns. This may support the development of guidelines or policies to provide care for those with reproductive concerns who require nursing care.",['Kang SJ; An HJ; Hwang WY; Lee H; Kim Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075411,the RCAC was translated into Korean and evaluated in a preliminary study involving 10 cancer survivors. the RCAC demonstrated a satisfactory level of validity per exploratory factor analysis. the RCAC demonstrated a satisfactory level of validity per exploratory factor analysis.
Estimating the impact of menstrual poverty on adolescents in Nova Scotia.,"Menstrual poverty is defined as the inability of people who menstruate to obtain menstrual products due to financial burden. The impact of menstrual poverty is not well studied in developed countries. This study aims to estimate the impact of menstrual poverty on adolescents who reside in Nova Scotia (NS), Canada. A web-based, 25-item questionnaire, the adolescent Menstrual Poverty Questionnaire (aMPQ), was developed and distributed via social media. Adolescents less than 18 years of age, English-speaking and living in NS were eligible to complete the questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive analysis. Four hundred and twenty adolescents completed the questionnaire, with a mean age of 16.1 years (14.4-17.9 years). Results revealed that 65% of respondents do not always have enough money to buy menstrual products. This led to unsafe menstrual hygiene practices including using alternatives for menstrual products (e.g., rags), washing disposable menstrual products, and/or wearing products for longer than intended. Forty percent of respondents reported lack of affordability of menstrual products as a cause for school absenteeism and lack of participation in sport/social activities. Seventy percent of respondents felt embarrassed to ask for products even when they are provided for free, and almost all supported the idea of having freely available menstrual products in public washrooms. This study determined that menstrual poverty impacts adolescents in Nova Scotia. To address menstrual poverty, menstrual products should be freely available in all public washrooms, as this will provide unrestricted access to menstruators and promote their full participation in society.",['Lukindo M; Price V; Pike M'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36524025,menstrual poverty is defined as the inability of menstruate to obtain menstrual products due to financial burden. 65% of respondents do not always have enough money to buy menstrual products.
Intimate partner violence against adolescent girls: regional and national prevalence estimates and associated country-level factors.,"Intimate partner violence is a serious public health problem and negatively affects short-term and long-term health, development, and wellbeing of adolescent girls. Global estimates from WHO have shown that adolescent girls aged 15-19 years experience high rates of intimate partner violence. We aimed to estimate the lifetime and past-year prevalence and patterns of physical or sexual intimate partner violence against adolescent girls by male partners across 161 countries and areas, and to examine the country-level factors, including the prevalence of child marriage, associated with the lifetime and past-year prevalence of intimate partner violence in this age group. These analyses used the 2018 global, regional, and country estimates on intimate partner violence published by WHO and economic, social, and political metadata from subject-specific databases. Drawing on data from the WHO Global Database on Prevalence of Violence Against Women, we used hierarchical Bayesian modelling techniques to estimate lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical or sexual (or both) intimate partner violence against adolescent girls aged 15-19 years by country. Linear regression methods were used to examine contextual social, economic, and political factors associated with intimate partner violence against adolescent girls in the 101 countries (lifetime prevalence) and 105 countries (past-year prevalence) for which these metadata were available. The estimated global prevalence of physical or sexual intimate partner violence against ever-partnered adolescent girls aged 15-19 years was 24% (95% uncertainty interval 21-28) in their lifetime and 16% (14-19) in the past year. Prevalence varied greatly across countries and regions, with lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% (1-6) in Georgia to 49% (35-64) in Papua New Guinea. Overall, the prevalence of both lifetime (154 countries) and past-year (157 countries) intimate partner violence against adolescent girls was higher in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and regions than in high-income countries and regions. Countries with higher rates of female secondary school enrolment and those with inheritance laws that are more gender-equal had lower prevalence of intimate partner violence against adolescent girls. Lower-income countries and societies with a high prevalence of child marriage had higher prevalence of physical or sexual intimate partner violence against adolescent girls. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence of intimate partner violence against adolescent girls across the globe and its relationship with country-level contextual factors. They emphasise the need for promoting and ensuring policies and programmes that increase and ensure gender equality. Countries should strive to provide secondary education for all girls, ensure equal property rights for women, eliminate discriminatory gender norms, and address harmful practices such as child marriage.

"Violence and its related factors among infertile women attending assisted reproductive technique unit at Al-Azhar University, Cairo.","Violence against women is a distressing issue particularly when they are infertile. Nevertheless, many women who are infertile and exposed to violence continue their marriage and justify such choice. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of violence against infertile women and its associated factors. This cross-sectional study involved 364 Egyptian women with primary infertility; they were randomly selected from the assisted reproductive technique unit of Al-Azhar University's International Islamic Center for Population Studies and Research. The data were collected through an interview questionnaire including the Infertile Women's Exposure to Violence Determination Scale (IWEVDS), socio-demographic, conception, and community-related factors. Moderate/high violence level was detected among 50.5% (95% CI = 45.3- 55.8%) of the studied infertile women, the mean ± SD of total score of IWEVDS was 48.27 ± 21.6. Exclusion was the most frequent type of violence among them. Binary logistic regression revealed that wives who had lower-educated husbands, lived in low-income families, had undergone prior IVF treatment, and who perceived gender inequality acceptance in society were more likely to expose to violence than others (OR = 3.76, 4.25, 2.05, and 2.08 respectively) (P value < 0.05). Infertile women have frequent exposure to different types of violence and many factors were implicated in such condition. Despite exposure to violence, infertile women refused divorce because they had no alternative financial sources as well as they were afraid of loneliness. A community mobilization approach to control this problem through a collaboration of all stakeholders is recommended.",['Ahmed DS; Elela AMA; Ismail SS; Almowafy AA; Abou-Elyazid H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39085845,study involved 364 women with primary infertility. they were randomly selected from assisted reproductive technique unit. exclusion was the most frequent type of violence among them.
Gender- and Obesity-Specific Association of Co-Exposure to Personal Care Product and Plasticizing Chemicals and Short Sleep Duration among Adults: Evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2016.,"There is limited evidence about the gender- and obesity-specific effects of personal care product and plasticizing chemicals (PCPPCs) on short sleep duration in adults. We evaluated the gender- and obesity-specific association of co-exposure to PCPPCs and short sleep duration among adults aged 20-60 years using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016, a secondary data source from the United States. Seventeen PCPPCs, including five phenols, two parabens, and ten phthalates, were detected, and sleep duration was assessed among 3012 adults. Logistic regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were employed. We found that bisphenol A (BPA), mono (caboxy-isooctyl) phthalate (MCOP), and mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) were consistently positively associated with short sleep duration in both females and males regardless of obesity status, except for BPA with general obesity. In particular, mono benzyl phthalate (MBzP) revealed a positive association in females, mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) revealed a positive association in males, and MiBP revealed a positive association in abdominal obesity. Similar associations were observed in the mixture. Our study highlights that PCPPCs are independently associated with an increasing risk of short sleep duration in adults both individually and as a mixture; however, gender- and obesity-specific differences may have little effect on certain individual PCPPCs on short sleep duration.",['Bigambo FM; Sun J; Zhu C; Zheng S; Xu Y; Wu D; Xia Y; Wang X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058155,"there is limited evidence about the gender- and obesity-specific association of co-exposure to personal care product and plasticizing chemicals. seventeen PCPPCs, including five phenols, two parabens, and ten phthalates, were detected. sleep duration was assessed among 3012 adults."

"Menstrual cycle-associated effects on some acute phase reactants parameters of Students in Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto, North Western Nigeria.","The menstrual cycle is the cycle of natural variations that occurs in the uterus and ovary as an essential part of making sexual reproduction possible. It is characterized by hormonal changes but the changes that occur in some active phase reactants (APR) parameters have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare the serum albumin, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels in follicular and luteal phases of menstruation. A total of 90 healthy regularly menstruating women where used for this study. Forty-five of the study participants were in their follicular phase while the other 45 where in their luteal phase. Four milliliters of blood were withdrawn from each patient under aseptic condition and two milliliters was dispensed into EDTA container while the other two milliliters were dispensed into a plane container. The EDTA anticoagulated blood was used for ESR and full blood count while the serum from the plain tubes was used for analysis of C-reactive protein and Serum Albumin. Sysmex K-3 auto-analyser (Sysmex, Kobe Japan) was used for te determination of full blood count, the Westergren method was used for ESR estimation, Bromo Cresyl Green method was used for serum albumin and ELISA method was used for CRP determination. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 23. This study showed a statistically significant difference in the ESR (p= 0.03) among menstruating women in the follicular and luteal phases of menstruation. Sociodemographic factors had no statistically significant effect on the APR parameters of menstruating women in the follicular and luteal phases of menstruation (p> 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between acute phase proteins of menstruating women in the follicular phase and luteal phases (p> 0.05). Also, age and marital status did not affect the acute phase proteins among menstruating women in the follicular phase and luteal phases (p> 0.05). There is need to generate data on menstrual disorders and their impact on women's health status, quality of life and social integration. It is vital that evaluation and treatment of menstrual complaints should be given a higher priority in primary care programs.

"The Epidemiological Characteristics and Spatiotemporal Clustering of Measles - China, 2005-2022.","In recent years, the incidence of measles in China has consistently remained below 1 per 100,000 population, yet the disease has not been eliminated. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the epidemiological characteristics of measles from 2005 to 2022, identify high-risk populations and areas, and propose targeted interventions. We utilized data from the China Disease Prevention and Control Information System for our comprehensive analysis. Spatial autocorrelation was employed to examine the spatial clustering of measles, while spatiotemporal scanning analysis was used to detect spatiotemporal clustering to describe measles epidemiology during the study period. Between 2005 and 2022, 732,218 measles cases were reported in China. Overall, the incidence of measles exhibited a downward trend, particularly during the periods of 2008-2011 and 2015-2022. In 2022, the incidence rate reached its historical low at 0.039 per 100,000 population. Measles predominantly affects young children. Since 2017, global spatial clustering has diminished, although hotspot areas persist in the western provinces. Spatial-temporal scanning identified a high-incidence cluster from 2005 to 2008, comprising 15 provinces in the western, central, and northern regions of China. Conversely, from 2016 to 2022, a low-incidence cluster was detected in the southern and central provinces. China has made significant progress in measles prevention and control. The recent low incidence and absence of substantial spatiotemporal clustering indicate that China is nearing measles elimination. However, there is a continuing need to enhance prevention and control efforts among very young children and in historic incidence hotspots in western provinces. Additionally, improving the diagnosis of vaccine-associated rash illnesses is essential.",['Liu Q; Li J; Liu S; Tang L; Wang X; Huang A; Xu X; Xiu Y; Yang H; Wen N; Rodewald L; Wang F; Yin Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39027631,"measles prevalence has consistently remained below 1 per 100,000 population. in recent years, the disease has not been eliminated. measles prevalence has decreased since 2017."
Correlates of depressive symptoms among workers in small- and medium-scale manufacturing enterprises in Japan.,"Although the relationship between job stress and depressive symptoms has been well documented among workers in large scale enterprises, the situation in small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) is not fully understood. To clarify the factors associated with depressive symptoms in SMEs in Japan. 1,516 male and 738 female Japanese workers at SMEs were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. We applied hierarchical multiple linear regression with depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Symptoms Scale) as the dependent variable, and (1) Individual, (2) Lifestyle, (3) Job stressors, and (4) SME unique factors as independent variables entered in 4 steps. Analyses were stratified by sex due to large differences in stress scores and demographic variables. Perceived lack of understanding from others with regard to health was the strongest factor associated with increased depressive symptoms (BETA=0.29 in males and 0.28 in females). Higher intragroup conflict (BETA=0.15 in males and 0.09 in females), perceived job future ambiguity (BETA=0.09 in males and 0.11 in females), higher quantitative workload (BETA=0.06 in males and 0.10 in females), and being an employer or a member of the employer's family (BETA=0.06 in males and 0.10 in females) were additional factors associated with high depressive symptoms. Economic concern, being single, cigarette smoking, shorter sleep duration, and skill underutilization were male specific, while younger age and lower social support at work were female specific factors significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms. These data suggest that poor mental health may be prevented by creating a workplace climate which focuses on the high value of the health of fellow workers.",['Ikeda T; Nakata A; Takahashi M; Hojou M; Haratani T; Nishikido N; Kamibeppu K'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19057116,"1,516 male and 738 female workers at SMEs were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. we applied hierarchical multiple linear regression with depressive symptoms."
A Cross-Sectional Study of the Relationship Between Perceived Stress and Thyroid Function Among Apparently Normal Women in the Reproductive Age.,"A substantial majority of women in India report experiencing stress frequently, with a significant number indicating a lack of time for relaxation. Women within a central productive age bracket often report higher stress levels. Chronic stress can lead to the development of autoimmune disorders affecting the thyroid gland. To evaluate the relationship between perceived stress and thyroid function among apparently normal women of reproductive age. The present study was conducted at the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) after obtaining clearance from the Institutional Ethical Committee and informed written consent from the participants. One hundred and fourteen working women aged 20-49 who consented to the study and had no personal or family history of medical illness or thyroid disease were randomly selected. Stress levels were measured using a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and thyroid parameters (total triiodothyronine [T3], total thyroxine [T4], and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) in blood samples were assessed by the electrochemical luminescence immunoassay method. Anthropometric parameters such as age and body mass index (BMI), as well as vital parameters like pulse rate and blood pressure, were measured for all participants. A detailed history was also recorded, including marital status, duration of married life, education, number of children, type of family, per capita income, phase of menstrual cycle, and dietary habits. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0 was used for statistical analysis. The analysis used Pearson's chi-square test, Student's t-test, and binary logistic regression. A positive correlation was observed between PSS and TSH (correlation coefficient ""r"" value = 0.060) without a significant p-value. Participants were divided into two groups based on TSH values: those with normal thyroid function (TSH <4.2 international units [IU]) and those with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (TSH >4.2 IU). Both groups had total T3 and T4 levels within the normal reference range. A highly significant difference was observed for age, BMI, TSH, marital status, and duration of married life between women with normal thyroid function and those with SCH. No significant difference was found between the two groups for PSS. Both acute and chronic stress affect thyroid function through the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Psychological and physiological stressors induce immune modulations that can lead to autoimmune thyroid diseases, resulting in hypothyroidism. The study examined the link between stress and thyroid health in women of childbearing age, revealing a trend where higher stress levels corresponded with increased TSH levels, though not significantly. It also found that older age, higher BMI, and longer duration of marriage were linked to a greater occurrence of SCH. These findings underscore the potential influence of lifestyle factors and stress on thyroid function, suggesting that stress management and demographic factors should be considered in managing thyroid health. For women of reproductive age under high stress, routine monitoring of thyroid function could be beneficial for overall health maintenance.",['Puttaswamy SH; Nandibewur NP; Kumar P; Venkataiah V; Pinjar MJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38576682,a substantial majority of women in India report experiencing stress frequently. a significant number indicating a lack of time for relaxation. chronic stress can lead to the development of autoimmune disorders affecting the thyroid gland.

AMEHC is a prospective longitudinal cohort of 2016 adolescent girls recruited at the commencement of class 6 (secondary school, mean age=12) across 101 schools selected through a proportional random sampling approach. Each year, the cohort will be asked to complete a survey capturing (1) girls' menstrual health and experiences, (2) support for menstrual health, and (3) health and education outcomes. Survey questions were refined through qualitative research, cognitive interviews and pilot survey in the year preceding the cohort. Girls' guardians will be surveyed at baseline and wave 2 to capture their perspectives and household demographics. Annual assessments will capture schools' water, sanitation and hygiene, and support for menstruation and collect data on participants' education, including school attendance and performance (in maths, literacy). Cohort enrolment and baseline survey commenced in February 2023. Follow-up waves are scheduled for 2024, 2025 and 2026, with plans for extension. A nested subcohort will follow 406 post-menarche girls at 2-month intervals throughout 2023 (May, August, October) to describe changes across menstrual periods. This protocol outlines a priori hypotheses regarding the impacts of menstrual health to be tested through the cohort. AMEHC has ethical approval from the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee (369/22) and BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health Institutional Review Board (IRB-06 July 22-024).

"Menarcheal experience, beliefs about and attitudes toward menstruation in Mexico: Changes in the last 20 years.","We explored how menarcheal experiences and attitudes toward menstruation of Mexican adolescents have changed in the last 20 years. Two questionnaires were applied to female adolescent students, and the results were compared with those obtained in 2002-3 when adolescents of the same ages were surveyed using the same questionnaires. Although some aspects of menstrual education have not changed, the secrecy surrounding menstruation has diminished. In contrast, the belief that menstruation is disabling and keeps women from their normal activities has increased.

"Gendered health, economic, social and safety impact of COVID-19 on adolescents and young adults in Nairobi, Kenya.","Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 and their mitigation measures can exacerbate underlying gender disparities, particularly among adolescents and young adults in densely populated urban settings. An existing cohort of youth ages 16-26 in Nairobi, Kenya completed a phone-based survey in August-October 2020 (n = 1217), supplemented by virtual focus group discussions and interviews with youth and stakeholders, to examine economic, health, social, and safety experiences during COVID-19, and gender disparities therein. COVID-19 risk perception was high with a gender differential favoring young women (95.5% vs. 84.2%; p<0.001); youth described mixed concern and challenges to prevention. During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6% women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p<0.05) and in need of healthcare during the pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p<0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion). Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges (52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner sexual violence. Qualitative results contextualize the mental health impact of economic disruption and isolation, and, among young women, privacy constraints. Youth and young adults face gendered impacts of COVID-19, reflecting both underlying disparities and the pandemic's economic and social shock. Economic, health and technology-based supports must ensure equitable access for young women.

Knowledge and self-care practices in adolescent girls living in Nablus district during menstruation: a cross-sectional study.,"Menstruation is a natural phenomenon that occurs throughout the reproductive life of every woman. The aim of this study was to explore knowledge and self-care practices among Palestinian adolescent girls during their menstrual period. Reproductive health issues in adolescent girls is an important but neglected area of Palestinian research. For this cross-sectional study we recruited girls from grades seven, eight, and nine in the three biggest schools for girls in Nablus district. Participants were given a self-administered questionnaire that included questions about diet habits, daily activity, medication usage, and social norms related to the menstrual period. Data were analysed using SPSS version 17. The study protocol was approved ethically by Ibn Sina College for Health Sciences board. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the participants. 100 girls completed the questionnaire. 68 (68%) respondents referred to their mothers as the main source of information about dealing with menstrual periods. 52 (52%) respondents believed that salty food affects adversely on their health during the menstrual period, and 85 (85%) answered that showering is important during menstruation and that no harm comes from touching things during menstruation. 38 (38%) girls did not change food quality or quantity during menstruation, and 36 (36%) girls often take hot herbal drinks to relieve menstrual pain, whereas 63 (63%) girls reported use of analgesics. 94 (94%) respondents had a proper way of disposing of dirty pads. 45 (45%) girls said they used school toilets, 70 (70%) mentioned the availability of private doors, and 60 (60%) reported the availability of soap and water.

"Influence of Menstrual Cycle and Oral Contraceptive Phases on Strength Performance, Neuromuscular Fatigue and Perceived Exertion.","The aim of the study was to assess differences in strength performance, neuromuscular fatigue and perceived exertion across phases of the menstrual cycle (MC, early follicular [eFP], late follicular [lFP] and mid-luteal phase [mLP]) and oral contraceptives (OC, active pill phase [aPP] and non-active pill phase [nPP]). Secondly, in naturally menstruating women, the influence of fluctuating serum 17β-estradiol nd progesterone concentrations on these parameters were analysed. Thirty-four women (21 with a natural MC and 13 using OCs) completed three or two experimental sessions, respectively. Mean mean propulsive velocity (MPV<sub>mean</sub>) and total number of repetitions (REP<sub>total</sub>) were assessed during a <i>power</i> (3x8 at 60%1RM) and <i>hypertrophy</i> squat loading (3 sets to failure at 70%1RM), respectively. Change in bench press and squat MPV at 60%1RM in response to the loadings were used as surrogates for non-local and local fatigue, respectively. Total blood lactate accumulation (BLA<sub>A</sub>) and markers of perceived exertion were assessed in each session. No significant differences between any of the MC or OC phases were observed for MPV<sub>mean</sub>, REP<sub>total</sub>, non-local and local fatigue and markers of perceived exertion (all p>0.050). A higher intraindividual 17β-estradiol concentration was significantly associated with a lower MPV<sub>mean</sub> (p=0.019). BLA<sub>A</sub> was significantly higher in lFP compared to mLP (p=0.019) and negatively associated with the intraindividual progesterone concentration (p=0.005). While 17β-estradiol may negatively influence the MPV, it appears that fluctuations of both sex hormones across the MC and OC phases are not prominent enough to induce significant nor practically relevant changes in the assessed parameters.",['Dragutinovic B; Moser F; Notbohm HL; Ihalainen JK; Bloch W; Schumann M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052822,"study was to assess differences in strength performance, neuromuscular fatigue and perceived exertion across phases of the menstrual cycle. the study was to assess differences in strength performance, neuromuscular fatigue and perceived exertion across phases of the menstrual cycle."
"Experiences of women living with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A pilot case-control, single-cycle, daily Menstrual Cycle Diary study during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects many people and is often distressing. Much medical literature about diagnosis and treatment exists, but little is known about PCOS menstrual cycle-related experiences except that cycles tend to be far-apart and unpredictable. Our purpose was to examine the menstrual cycle and daily life experiences in those with PCOS having approximately month-apart cycles compared with age and BMI-matched cohort controls using data from the Menstruation & Ovulation Study 2 (MOS2) during the first 1.5 years of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We hypothesized that those with PCOS would experience lower self-worth and more negative moods. This is a single-cycle prospective case-control study in community-dwelling women ages 19-35 years. Eight reported physician-diagnosed PCOS and were matched (1:3 ratio) with controls by age (within .6 years) and BMI (within .19 BMI units). Experiences were recorded daily (Menstrual Cycle Diary©, Diary). All kept daily morning temperatures to assess luteal phase lengths by the validated Quantitative Basal Temperature© analysis method. From 112 in MOS2, 32 women were compared: eight with PCOS versus 24 controls. Demographic, socioeconomic, comorbidities and lifestyle variables were not different between the two groups. Cycle lengths were similar in PCOS and controls (one PCOS and control each had oligomenorrhea; most lengths were 21-35 days, P = .593). Unexpectedly, luteal phase lengths were also similar between PCOS and controls (P = .167); anovulation occurred in 5 with PCOS, and in 9 controls. There were no significant Diary differences between the two groups except for greater ""outside stress"" in the PCOS group (P = .020). In contrast to our hypotheses, there were no significant differences in feelings of self-worth, anxiety nor depression. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was a stressful time for women. MOS2 captured granular menstrual cycles, ovulation and daily experiences in women with PCOS compared with age- and BMI-matched controls. These pilot data in women with milder PCOS are the first of more research required to understand the daily experiences in those living with PCOS.",['Nelson K; Shirin S; Kalidasan D; Prior JC'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38157371,menstrual cycle and daily life experiences in women with PCOS. study was conducted during the first 1.5 years of the pandemic. study was conducted in community-dwelling women ages 19-35 years.
Critical menarche age for late-life dementia and the role of education and socioeconomic status.,"Estrogen exposure during menstrual years has been associated with late-life neuroprotection. We explored the presence of an age-sensitive menarche window for cognition in old age and the impact of socioeconomic status and education. We compared neuropsychological performance of 1082 older women [Mean<sup>AGE</sup> = 72.69 (5.48)] with menarche in childhood, early-, mid-, and late-adolescence and dementia prevalence, severity, and type, including the effects of education and socioeconomic status. Adjusting for covariates, menarche at 11-14 years of age was associated with better memory, executive and global cognitive functioning in old age, and stronger positive effects of education and socioeconomic status on cognition than those with menarche at 15-17 years. We found a critical age window for the neuroprotective effects of estrogens during early adolescence, putting women with later menarche at higher risk for cognitive decline. Effects of socioeconomic status and education in adulthood should be a focus of future research.",['Moza S; Scarmeas N; Yannakoulia M; Dardiotis E; Hadjigeorgiou GM; Sakka P; Kosmidis MH'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39115104,"menarche age for late-life dementia and role of education and socioeconomic status. menarche at 11-14 years of age was associated with better memory, executive and global cognitive functioning in old age."
"The Comparison of Irisin, Subfatin, and Adropin in Normal-Weight and Obese Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients.","A combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to the highly common, complex, and varied endocrine condition known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women. PCOS primarily affects women between the ages of 15 and 35 who are in the early to late stages of pregnancy. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of irisin, subfatin, and adropin in PCOS with and without obesity compared to the control group. The present cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022 at Al-Nahrain University/Department of Chemistry (Baghdad, Iraq). The serum levels of irisin, subfatin, and adropin were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Body mass index, lipid profile, insulin, fasting glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels were also evaluated. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by GraphPad Prism software version 8.0.2. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study population comprised PCOS patients (n=90, divided into 45 obese and 45 normal weight) and healthy women (n=30). According to the results, the serum levels of irisin were significantly higher (P<0.001) in obese and normal-weight PCOS patients than controls. While adropin and subfatin were significantly lower in PCOS than controls (P<0.001). Moreover, there are higher levels of serum insulin, fasting glucose, and luteinizing hormone in PCOS women than in healthy women. According to the findings, PCOS patients had a higher level of irisin than the controls. In addition, decreased subfatin and adropin levels were observed in PCOS patients compared with healthy women.

Relationship between menstruation status and work conditions in Japan.,"Menstrual problems can significantly impact daily and work life. In reaction to a shrinking population, the Japanese government is encouraging more women to participate in the labor force. Actual success in achieving this aim, however, is limited. Specifically, participation in the workforce by women during their reproductive years is impacted by their health, which involves not only work conditions, but also traditional family circumstances. Therefore, it is important to further assess and gather more information about the health status of women who work during their reproductive years in Japan. Specifically, women's health can be represented by menstruation status, which is a pivotal indicator. In this study, we assessed the association between short rest periods in work intervals and menstruation and other health status indicators among female workers in Japan. Study participants were recruited from the alumnae of a university, which provided a uniform educational level. All 9864 female alumnae were asked to join the survey and 1630 (17%) accepted. The final sample of study participants (<i>n</i> = 505) were aged 23-43 years, had maintained the same job status for at least 1 year, and were not shift workers, had no maternal status, and did not lack any related information. The participants were divided into two groups according to interval time, with 11 h between end of work and resumption of daily work as a benchmark. This interval time was based on EU regulations and the goal set by the government of Japan. Health outcomes included: menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhoea symptoms, anxiety regarding health, and satisfaction in terms of health. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for health indexes in association with interval time by adjusting for confounding variables that included both psychosocial and biological factors. We compared the health status of women in the workforce with and without a sufficient interval time of 11 h/day. Workers who had a short interval time had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety about health and dissatisfaction with their health. For menstruation status, only abnormal menstruation cycles were observed more often among workers in the short interval group than those of the long interval group. However, this association disappeared when biological confounding factors were adjusted in a multivariable regression model. Dysmenorrhea symptoms did not show a statistically significant association with short interval time. This study found a significant association between a short interval time of less than 11 h/day and subjective health indicators and the menstrual health status of women in the workforce. Menstrual health was more affected by biological factors than social psychological factors. A long work time and short interval time could increase worker anxiety and dissatisfaction and may deteriorate the menstrual cycle.",['Nishikitani M; Nakao M; Tsurugano S; Inoure M; Yano E'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29026436,menstruation status is a pivotal indicator of women's health. women's health can be represented by menstruation status. the study was conducted by 9864 female alumnae from a university.
"Menstrual hygiene management practice and associated factors among high school and preparatory school adolescent students in Debre Markos town, Northwest, Ethiopia: a mixed-method study.","Despite being a normal occurrence, menstruation requires hygienic care and is associated with a number of myths and wrongdoings. Menstrual hygiene issues have been linked to major health issues, such as urinary tract and reproductive tract infections. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the management of menstrual hygiene and related aspects among teenage students in Debre Markos town, North West, Ethiopia. From March 15 to April 15, 2019, teenage pupils in Debre Markos town participated in a cross-sectional mixed study. An in-depth interview and a self-administered structured questionnaire were used to gather data. Quantitative information was imported into Epi Data and then exported to SPSS for examination. A 95% Confidence Interval of p-value ≤ 0.05 was used to declare significance. The method of thematic content analysis was used to examine the qualitative data. This study comprised 531 individuals in total, with a 96.2% response rate. Approximately 260 adolescent females (49%, 95% CI: 39.2, 59.2) had good management practices for menstrual hygiene. Girls whose mothers were private employees (AOR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.99), self-employed (AOR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.98) and housewives (AOR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.98), and parent-adolescent discussions about menstruation (AOR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.40, 3.34) were significantly associated with good menstrual hygiene management. Adolescence aged 17 years or older (AOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.32, 3.44) were found to have good knowledge regarding menstrual hygiene (AOR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.43, 2.94). The qualitative study found that ignorance, an unfavorable school climate, and cultural and economic factors were the main causes of teenagers' poor menstrual hygiene. Nearly half of adolescent girls had good menstrual hygiene practice. Menstrual hygiene practice was associated with adolescent age, knowledge of menstruation, maternal occupational and discussion with parents. Girls had difficulty to manage menstrual hygiene due to poor knowledge, unsafe school environment, and cultural barriers. Thus, school-based programs aimed at improving knowledge towards menstrual hygiene management are needed.",['Worku Y; Kassa GM; Mekonen B; Desta M; Bishaw KA; Gedfaw M; Tesfaw E; Degu G; Shiferaw A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39048992,"a mixed-method study was conducted in Debre Markos town, north west,.

Improving Menstrual Health Literacy Through Life-Skills Programming in Rural Ethiopia.,"Despite its cultural and biological importance, limited knowledge about menstruation and cultural taboos in many contexts mean that menarche often brings fear and stigma. In Ethiopia, the context of this paper, lack of knowledge and the stigma around menstruation create challenges for adolescent girls related to menstrual hygiene management and their reproductive health more broadly. This paper uses a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT), with 97 communities (<i>kebeles</i>) randomly assigned to treatment or control, to assess the impact of a gender-transformative life-skills intervention [Act With Her-Ethiopia (AWH-E)] on the menstrual health literacy of very young adolescent girls and boys (10-14) in two diverse regions of Ethiopia (South Gondar, Amhara and East Hararghe, Oromia). The evaluation employs a longitudinal mixed-methods design, with baseline data collected in late 2017/early 2018 and follow-up data collected in late 2019/early 2020. Quantitative surveys were undertaken with 2,492 very young adolescents and their primary caregivers, and complemented by qualitative interviews with 291 adolescents and their caregivers, as well as 96 key informants at community and district levels. Our quantitative findings highlight large and statistically significant improvements on norms around menstruation, knowledge about menstruation and biological function, and knowledge and behavior related to menstrual hygiene management, but with important differences by location and gender. Qualitative findings further unpack these gender and regional differences, highlighting the importance of adapting programming to the local context and, where possible, connecting to other health and gender initiatives. This analysis helps fill the evidence gap on ""what works"" to improve menstrual health literacy in rural low- and middle-income contexts.",['Baird S; Hamory J; Gezahegne K; Pincock K; Woldehanna T; Yadete W; Jones N'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35873135,"a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) is used to assess the impact of a gender-transformative life-skills intervention on menstrual health literacy. the study uses a longitudinal mixed-methods design, with baseline data collected in late 2017/early 2018 and follow-up data collected in late 2019/early 2020."
Pathophysiological Implications of Interstitial Cajal-like Cells (ICC-like) in Uterus: A Comparative Study with Gastrointestinal ICCs.,"The main function of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) is to regulate gastrointestinal peristalsis by acting as a ""pacemaker"" cell by generating spontaneous slow electrical waves. In 2005, electron microscopy revealed a cell type similar to ICCs (ICC-like) outside the gastrointestinal tract, with contractile activity and c-Kit<sup>+</sup> immunohistochemistry shared with ICCs. Among the locations where ICC-like cells have been observed, it is in the uterus where they have a significant functional and pathophysiological role. These cells are involved in obstetric phenomena of contractile action, such as ascending sperm transport, embryo implantation, pregnancy, delivery, and the expulsion of menstrual debris. Within the pathophysiology related to these cells, we find obstetric alterations such as recurrent miscarriages, premature deliveries, abolition of uterine contractions, and failures of embryo implantation, in addition to other common conditions in the fertile age, such as endometriosis and leiomyoma.",['López-Pingarrón L; Almeida H; Pereboom-Maicas D; García JJ'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754260,"interstitial cells of cajal regulate gastrointestinal peristalsis by acting as a ""pacemaker"" cell.

Period Product Resources and Needs in Missouri Schools: Focus Group Discussions with School Nurses.,"This study explored period product resources and needs in Missouri schools from the perspective of school nurses. We conducted eight focus groups with school nurses (n = 51) across Missouri using purposive sampling. Focus group data were analyzed in Dedoose via multiple coders and achieved strong inter-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa = 0.92). Several interconnected themes with associated sub-themes were identified. First, school nurses do not have sufficient resources to help students manage menstruation and minimize menstruation-related absenteeism. Second, schools' heavy reliance on donations can lead to inconsistencies in supply and a mismatch between what is donated and what is most needed. Third, school nurses desire additional educational resources around menstruation management for students and caregivers. Nurse-identified themes can help inform recommendations for improving schools' response to students' menstrual hygiene needs by highlighting priorities for educational content, resources, and product acquisition with a goal of ensuring the suitability and sustainability of MHM in schools.",['Kuhlmann AKS; Palovick KA; Allen C; Teni MT; Marshall C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38646704,school nurses conducted eight focus groups with school nurses across the state. focus groups were analyzed via multiple coders. school nurses do not have sufficient resources to help students manage menstruation.
Perception of Climate Change Vulnerability and its Impact on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Khutiya and Banganga River Basins.,"Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The drivers of climate risk include its topography, ecological diversity, climatic variability, natural resource dependency, under-development, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Climate change affects women and girls in unique ways. Research conducted in Asia Pacific region highlight negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes from climate change-related stressors such as droughts, floods, and air pollution, factors also linked to decreased SRH services utilization, increased maternal mortality rates, and repercussions on women's mental health. This is a mixed methods study conducted in two river basins including household surveys with 384 females ages 18-49, 12 focus group discussions, and 22 key informant interviews. We conducted descriptive and thematic analysis. More than half relied on agriculture for income (66%). Despite one-third being heads of households, land ownership was low (13%). Climate change perceptions included rising temperatures (88%), increased heat wave (70%), drying water source (99%), and delayed monsoons (83%), impacting agriculture and increasing women's workload (61%) due to displacement and male migration. 64% reported disturbances in antenatal and postnatal care visits . Inaccessible healthcare facilities during the rainy season increased maternal mortality risks. Heavy river flooding hindered female community health volunteers access leading to childbirth complications. 82% of women feared being unable to protect their children post-climate events. Moreover, 21% of women faced gender-based violence during or after climate disasters. Our findings suggest clear impacts of climate change on women and the communities. Thus, climate adaptation efforts must be designed to address the unique impacts of the crisis on women and girls, making space for their increased participation and leadership.",['Poudel K; Karki S; Lamichhane K; Timilsina A; Dijkerman S; Ghimire J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080933,"climate change affects women and girls in unique ways. climate change affects women and girls in unique ways. despite one-third being heads of households, land ownership was low (13%)"
Family physicians and menstrual care: An analysis of CERA 2023.,"Menstrual health is an important indicator of overall health and has large impacts on quality of life. Despite number and impact, discussion of menstruation remains largely taboo within health care. Patients and physicians are not engaging in regular, meaningful discussions on menstruation. Family physicians, as primary care providers, can facilitate these important conversations. We sought to understand the profile of menstrual care providing family physicians and assessed physician comfort, knowledge, training, and perceived importance regarding menstrual care. This is a cross-sectional analysis of the 2022 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance survey. The survey included actively practicing US physicians who are members of the Council of Academic Family Medicine organizations. Descriptive demographic statistics were calculated; chi-square tests were generated for menstrual care-specific items; logistic regression models were fit to determine the association between receiving formal menstrual care training, importance of physician training in menstrual care, and demographic factors. Eighty-five percent of respondents report frequently providing menstrual care. Participants of younger age, or who had earned their degree more recently, were significantly more likely to provide frequent menstrual care. Respondents who earned their medical degree at an earlier year were significantly more likely to believe that physician training in menstrual care was of limited importance (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.03). Our findings show that family physicians are providing menstrual care, despite non-uniform training, and recognize its importance to patients. By understanding physician profile and the care they provide, we can work toward comprehensive physician education in menstrual care and providing appropriate menstrual care to patients.",['Casola AR; Rea O; Ho T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676375,"menstrual health is an important indicator of overall health and has large impacts on quality of life. family physicians, as primary care providers, can facilitate these important conversations. we sought to understand the profile of menstrual care providing family physicians."
Hypertension evaluation and management in new young patients: are we doing our female patients a disservice?,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death in women, largely underpinned by hypertension. Current guidelines recommend first-line therapy with a RAAS-blocking agent especially in young people. There are well documented sex disparities in CVD outcomes and management. We evaluate the management of patients with newly diagnosed hypertension in a tertiary care clinic to assess male-female differences in investigation and treatment. Clinic letters of all new patients under the age of 51 attending the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic between January and December 2023 were reviewed. The primary outcomes measured were first-line treatment choices, deviations from guideline-recommended treatment, investigations for secondary hypertension, and documentation of female-specific risk factors and family planning advice. Secondary outcomes included clinical characteristics such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure at referral and at the new patient appointment, age at diagnosis, age at first appointment, and the number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed at referral. One hundred and five (59:46, M:F) new patient encounters were reviewed after sixteen exclusions for non-attendance and inappropriate clinic coding. Choice of first line antihypertensive agent did not vary between sexes with no deviation from guideline-recommended medical therapy. Men, however, had more biochemical investigations conducted for secondary causes across all ages. This was greatest in those under 40 years old. There was suboptimal documentation of female-specific risk factors (obstetric and gynaecological history), contraceptive drug history and family planning with 35%, 20%, and 15.6%, respectively. In 2023, women under 51 years of age seen in a tertiary care hypertension clinic received similar first-line treatment to their male peers. However, relevant female-specific histories were suboptimally documented for these patients.

"Comparison of body image and peer relations among girls with normal, early, and late menarche.","The onset of menstruation is a turning point in women's sexual maturity that, unlike other stages of growth, occurs abruptly and is a critical stage in girls' lives. The present study investigated body image and peer relations among girls with early, late, and normal menarche. This casual-comparative descriptive study included female students aged 9-17 in Isfahan. The participants were selected using multistage cluster random sampling. Out of 5,984 students, 56, 37, and 43 were selected for the normal, early, and late menarche groups. The Body Image Concern Inventory and Index of Peer Relations were the two tools used in this study. Moreover, the data were analyzed using a covariance statistical test. Girls with early menarche had better peer relations than those with late menarche (<i>P</i> = 0.01). In addition, there was a significant difference between adolescents with normal and late menarche in terms of body image (<i>P</i> = 0.01). Girls who experienced late menarche were more concerned about their body image and appearance; however, girls with early menarche experienced more impaired performance (<i>P</i> = 0.05). The first menstrual cycle, or menarche, affects psychological variables such as body image and peer relations.

Motion's privilege in recognizing facial expressions following treatment for blindness.,"In his 1872 monograph, Charles Darwin posited that ""… the habit of expressing our feelings by certain movements, though now rendered innate, had been in some manner gradually acquired.""<sup>1</sup> Nearly 150 years later, researchers are still teasing apart innate versus experience-dependent contributions to expression recognition.

Contraception in sea-going service personnel.,"The right to make an informed choice about contraception should be afforded to every individual serving within the United Kingdom (UK) Armed Forces. This article looks at the responsibilities and approach that healthcare professionals should take within a Primary Care setting, summarises the common contraceptive options available, discusses the associated advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and considers operational factors in a military environment that combine to influence the final contraceptive choice an individual makes. Case Study. A 19-year old Able Rate joined the Royal Navy (RN) and at her joining medical it was noted that she had been on Microgynon™ combined oral contraceptive pill for approximately three years. During this time, her menstrual periods remained light; she never experienced adverse effects, demonstrated good compliance, and was happy to remain on this contraceptive regimen. Over the course of the next eighteen months, she was reviewed by a number of Medical Officers and Civilian Medical Practitioners on a quarterly basis, with Microgynon™ re-prescribed on each occasion. The appropriate Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP) template was used, with weight, smoking status, compliance and any issues or comments documented accordingly. In December 2010, a discussion regarding long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) was documented for the first time. The patient agreed to give LARC some thought and a review appointment was made for one month. She was subsequently started on the progestogen-only pill Cerazette™. It was noted by the consulting doctor that both the patient's mother and grandmother had a positive history of cerebrovascular events and the combined oral contraceptive pill was discontinued. Upon review at two months, the patient reported that she was content on Cerazette™ and wished to continue with this medication. She was amenorrhoeic, highly compliant, had given up smoking and her weight and blood pressure were stable. However, due to supply issues, it was explained that Cerazette™ was no longer a viable option for her. She had no plans to start a family, and was keen to investigate other contraceptive options. Furthermore, she expressed a particular desire to remain amenorrhoeic, as she was due to deploy overseas in the coming months, and not only wanted to avoid the inconvenience of having her period, but also felt it preferable not to have to take a daily pill when considering the constantly changing time zones. She subsequently had the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant Nexplanon™ fitted without complication. She has remained amenorrhoeic throughout and this form of long-acting reversible contraception has particularly suited her busy working role and active lifestyle.",['Hawkins DM; Booth R'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25895414,"able Rate, 19, joined the royal navy and was on a combined oral contraceptive pill for three years. she was reviewed by a number of medical officers and civilian medical practitioners on a quarterly basis. the patient agreed to give LARC some thought and a review appointment was made for one month."
Recommendations for treatment of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH): an update.,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a family of autosomal recessive disorders. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency, in which there are mutations in CYP21A2 (the gene encoding the adrenal 21-hydroxylase enzyme), is the most common form (90%) of CAH. In classic CAH there is impaired cortisol production with diagnostic increased levels of 17-OH progesterone. Excess androgen production results in virilization and in the newborn female may cause development of ambiguous external genitalia. Three-fourths of patients with classic CAH also have aldosterone insufficiency, which can result in salt-wasting; in infancy this manifests as shock, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. CAH has a reported incidence of 1:10,000-1:20,000 births although there is an increased prevalence in certain ethnic groups. Nonclassic CAH (NCCAH) is a less severe form of the disorder, in which there is 20-50% of 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity (vs. 0-5% in classic CAH) and no salt wasting. The degree of symptoms related to androgen excess is variable and may be progressive with age, although some individuals are asymptomatic. NCCAH has an incidence of 1:1000-1:2000 births (0.1-0.2% prevalence) in the White population; an even higher prevalence is noted in certain ethnic groups such as Ashkenazi Jews (1-2%). As many as two-thirds of persons with NCCAH are compound heterozygotes and carry a severe and mild mutation on different alleles. This paper discusses the genetics of NCCAH, along with its variable phenotypic expression, and reviews the clinical course in untreated patients, which includes rapid early childhood growth, advanced skeletal age, premature adrenarche, acne, impaired reproductive function in both sexes and hirsutism as well as menstrual disorders in females. Finally, it addresses treatment with glucocorticoids vs. non treatment and other therapies, particularly with respect to long term issues such as adult metabolic disease including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and bone mineral density.",['Trapp CM; Oberfield SE'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22186144,nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) is a family of autosomal recessive disorders. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common form (90%) of CAH. in classic CAH there is impaired cortisol production with diagnostic increased levels of 17-OH progesterone.
Body mass index evolution and ovarian function in adolescent girls who received GnRH agonist treatment for central precocious puberty or early and fast puberty.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) has been used for central precocious puberty (CPP) or early and fast puberty. It was aimed to assess changes in body mass index (BMI), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) frequency, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in girls who had been treated with GnRHa. Fifty-eight adolescent girls treated with GnRHa for CPP or early and fast puberty (3.75 mg/28 days), between 2011 and 2015, were re-evaluated in 2020-2022 at least 2 years after menstruation. Hormonal analyses were compared with 51 healthy adolescents. In the GnRHa-treated group, a statistically significant increase was observed when the BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at the beginning of the treatment was compared with the BMI SDS at the end of the treatment (p=0.038). A statistically significant decrease was observed when the BMI SDS at the end of the treatment was compared with the BMI SDS in late adolescence (p=0.012). When the BMI SDS at the beginning of the treatment was compared with the BMI SDS in late adolescence, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference (p=0.196). Of the 58 girls in the GnRHa-treated group, 8 (14 %) had PCOS. Serum AMH levels did not differ between the GnRHa-treated and the control group. GnRHa treatment causes no adverse effect on BMI, at least in late adolescence. Girls treated with GnRHa were not found to be prone to developing PCOS.

Menstrual hygiene practices of adolescent secondary school girls in rural Anambra communities.,"Adolescent girls face numerous challenges which hinder their ability to manage menstruation in a healthy and dignified manner. To examine the menstrual hygiene practices of adolescent girls schooling in rural Anambra communities. Cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants were selected using multistage stratified random sampling technique and interviewed using self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0. Mean age of all, pre-menarche and post-menarche girls were 14.7 ± 1.84, 12.8 ± 1.09 and 15.1 ± 1.73 years, respectively. About 46% of the pre-menarche girls had not received any information on menstruation. Common sources of initial menstruation information were mother (87.3%), school (52.2%) and peers (20.0%). Among the 1091 (85.0% (1091/1283)) post-menarche girls, last menstrual period, last menstrual period duration and cycle length could not be recalled by 53.9%, 34.4% and 39.3%, respectively. Majority (98.3%) who could recall last menstrual period had a cycle length of ⩽30 days and the mean duration of menses was 4.4 ± 0.84 days. Disposable sanitary pad was mostly (60%) cited as recommended product, but cloth/rags (40.6%) or tissue paper (32. 3%) were predominantly used. Majority (88.6%) took their bath ⩾twice/day, 50.9% changed sanitary product ⩽twice/day while 72.5% exhibited poor hand washing. Sanitary products were mostly discarded by burning (45.4%). Fifty-one percent could not change in school predominantly due to lack of functional toilets/changing rooms (84.2%) while 72.5% of those who changed did so in bushes or unused spaces. Challenges faced during menstruation include restriction from holy places (38.9%), waist pain (74.9%), blood stains (36.1%) and lack of money to buy pad (27.0%). Factors significantly associated with using commercial pads were age (p = 0.047), class (p = 0.006), mother's educational status (p < 0.001), social class (p < 0.001), ability to recall last menstrual period date (p = 0.029) or duration (p = 0.001).

"Parent-child communication about sexual and reproductive health: evidence from the Brong Ahafo region, Ghana.","Young people aged 10-24 years represent one-third of the Ghanaian population. Many are sexually active and are at considerable risk of negative health outcomes due to inadequate sexual and reproductive health knowledge. Although growing international evidence suggests that parent-child sexual communication has positive influence on young people's sexual behaviours, this subject has been poorly studied among Ghanaian families. This study explored the extent and patterns of parent-child sexual communication, and the topics commonly discussed by parents. A cross-sectional design was used to sample 790 parent-child dyads through a two-stage cluster sampling technique with probability proportional to size. Interviewer-administered questionnaire method was used to gather quantitative data on parent-child communication about sex. Twenty sexual topics were investigated to describe the patterns and frequency of communication. The Pearson's chi-square and z-test for two-sample proportions were used to assess sexual communication differences between parents and young people. Qualitative data were used to flesh-out relevant issues which standard questionnaire could not cover satisfactorily. About 82.3% of parents had at some point in time discussed sexual and reproductive health issues with their children; nonetheless, the discussions centered on a few topics. Whereas child-report indicated that 78.8% of mothers had discussed sexual communication with their children, 53.5% of fathers had done so. Parental discussions on the 20 sexual topics ranged from 5.2%-73.6%. Conversely, young people's report indicates that mother-discussed topics ranged between 1.9%-69.5%, while father-discussed topics ranged from 0.4% to 46.0%. Sexual abstinence was the most frequently discussed topic (73.6%), followed by menstruation 63.3% and HIV/AIDS 61.5%; while condom (5.2%) and other contraceptive use (9.3%) were hardly discussed. The most common trigger of communication cited by parent-child dyads was parent's own initiation (59.1% vs. 62.6% p=0.22). Parents in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana do talk to children about sex, but their conversations cover limited topics. While abstinence is the most widely discussed sexual topic, condoms and contraception were rarely discussed. Sex educational programmes ought to encourage parents to expand sexual communication to cover more topics.",['Manu AA; Mba CJ; Asare GQ; Odoi-Agyarko K; Asante RK'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25889521,"evidence from the Brong Ahafo region, Ghana. young people aged 10-24 years represent one-third of the population. many are sexually active and are at considerable risk of negative health outcomes due to inadequate sexual and reproductive health knowledge."
Association Between the Oxidative Balance Score and Endometriosis: A Population-Based Study.,"To investigate the association between the oxidative balance score (OBS) and endometriosis. This cross-sectional study used four cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006). OBS involved 16 dietary nutrients and 4 lifestyle factors, including 5 pro-oxidants and 15 anti-oxidants. According to weighted quartiles, the OBS was divided into four categories: < 12.54, 12.54-18.70, 18.71-24.68, and > 24.68. Endometriosis was diagnosed based on a question from the reproductive health questionnaire. Weighted multivariate logistic analysis was used to investigate the association between OBS and endometriosis. Subgroup analysis was performed based on menstrual regularity and female hormone use. A total of 5095 women were included, with 1140 (22.37%), 1232 (24.18%), 1224 (24.02%), and 1499 (29.42%) women in the OBS < 12.54, of 12.54-18.70, of 18.71-24.68, and > 24.68 categories, respectively. After adjusting age, race, family poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), education level, uterine fibroids, menstrual regularity, oophorectomy, female hormone use, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and steroid drug, a high OBS (> 24.68) was found to be associated with lower odds of endometriosis [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.97, <i>P</i> = 0.033] compared to a low OBS (< 12.54). The similar result was also found in women with irregular menstruation (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.91, <i>P</i> = 0.020) and with female hormone use (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.98, <i>P</i> = 0.037).

An issue of blood: the healing of the woman with the haemorrhage (Mark 5.24B-34; Luke 8.42B-48; Matthew 9.19-22) in early medieval visual culture.,"The textual and visual tradition of the story of the woman with the haemorrhage (Mark 5.24b-34parr), the so-called Haemorrhoissa, is related in a specific way to Christ's healing miracles but also to conceptions of female menstrual blood. We notice that with regard to the specific 'issue of blood' of the Haemorrhoissa, there is a visual lacuna in the specific iconography that developed around the story from early Christian times: in the transposition from text to image, there is no immediate depiction of her bleeding. However, the early medieval reception of the story also became an important catalyst for uterine taboos, menstruation and tits relation to magical healing, understood as a system of health practices. In this context, the dissemination of the motif in everyday material culture clearly points to a deep-rooted connection to uterine and menstrual issues. The paper considers both expressions and their-anthropologically framed-relation to this female 'issue of blood', which the Haemorrhoissa came to embody and epitomise literally, as well as figuratively.",['Baert B; Kusters L; Sidgwick E'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22870845,the so-called Haemorrhoissa is related in a specific way to Christ's healing miracles. the textual and visual tradition of the story is related in a specific way to conceptions of female menstrual blood.
Tracking of menstrual cycles and prediction of the fertile window via measurements of basal body temperature and heart rate as well as machine-learning algorithms.,"Fertility awareness and menses prediction are important for improving fecundability and health management. Previous studies have used physiological parameters, such as basal body temperature (BBT) and heart rate (HR), to predict the fertile window and menses. However, their accuracy is far from satisfactory. Additionally, few researchers have examined irregular menstruators. Thus, we aimed to develop fertile window and menstruation prediction algorithms for both regular and irregular menstruators. This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted at the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Shanghai, China. Participants were recruited from August 2020 to November 2020 and followed up for at least four menstrual cycles. Participants used an ear thermometer to assess BBT and wore the Huawei Band 5 to record HR. Ovarian ultrasound and serum hormone levels were used to determine the ovulation day. Menstruation was self-reported by women. We used linear mixed models to assess changes in physiological parameters and developed probability function estimation models to predict the fertile window and menses with machine learning. We included data from 305 and 77 qualified cycles with confirmed ovulations from 89 regular menstruators and 25 irregular menstruators, respectively. For regular menstruators, BBT and HR were significantly higher during fertile phase than follicular phase and peaked in the luteal phase (all P < 0.001). The physiological parameters of irregular menstruators followed a similar trend. Based on BBT and HR, we developed algorithms that predicted the fertile window with an accuracy of 87.46%, sensitivity of 69.30%, specificity of 92.00%, and AUC of 0.8993 and menses with an accuracy of 89.60%, sensitivity of 70.70%, and specificity of 94.30%, and AUC of 0.7849 among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 72.51%, 21.00%, 82.90%, and 0.5808 respectively, for fertile window prediction and 75.90%, 36.30%, 84.40%, and 0.6759 for menses prediction. By combining BBT and HR recorded by the Huawei Band 5, our algorithms achieved relatively ideal performance for predicting the fertile window and menses among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the algorithms showed potential feasibility but still need further investigation. ChiCTR2000036556.

Menstruation Experiences of Middle and High School Students in the Midwest: A Pilot Study.,"The purpose of this pilot study was to expand understanding of the experience of menstruation for girls in the United States and its impact in the school setting. A qualitative approach was used to gather data from focus group interviews. Descriptive content analysis was used to categorize the range and types of menstruation experiences described by 12 participants aged 12-16 years. Findings revealed four main themes: (1) learning about menstruation, (2) experiencing menstruation, (3) managing menstruation, and (4) social norms and meaning of menstruation. Participants described multiple challenges faced learning about and experiencing menstruation, especially in the school setting. Participants described the limited understanding of menstruation experiences and confusion about the use of menstrual hygiene products. Challenges experienced at school included not having adequate access to menstrual hygiene products, limited time for changing products, fear of leaking menstrual blood, and impacts on school attendance.

Metabolomic and chemometric analyses of St. John's wort and related Asian Hypericum species linked to bioactivity.,"Plants in the genus Hypericum (Hypericaceae), include more than 500 species worldwide, and many are valued for their medicinal properties, and are used as traditional herbal medicines. However, only H. perforatum is officially recognized as herbal drug in several pharmacopoeias, and used as an antidepressant clinically. Hypericum perforatum had been used as an herbal medicine since the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. -220 A.D.) in China. It taxonomically belongs to the section Hypericum in the genus Hypericum. There are about 42 species in the section Hypericum, with six species occurring in China. All six are recorded as traditional herbal medicines for treating aliments, including hepatitis, malaria, traumatic hemorrhage, irregular menstruation, wounds, and bruises. The study aimed to characterize the chemical profiles of five phylogenetically related Hypericum species, and compare their metabolites with three H. perforatum products. Informed by ethnobotanical use, the extracts prepared from the five species were further investigated into anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiplasmodial activity. This study tested the hypothesis that systematic metabolomic and bioactivity characterization of species in section Hypericum will help to validate their phytotherapeutic use and reveal potential drug lead compounds. Targeted and non-targeted metabolic analyses coupled with chemometrics were conducted on H. perforatum and four medicinal species, H. attenuatum, H. enshiense, H. erectum, and H. faberi, native to China from section Hypericum. UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and UPLC-TQD-MS/MS were used for non-targeted and targeted metabolic analyses, respectively. Cytotoxicity bioassays on four cancer cell lines, anti-inflammation tests and anti-plasmodial activity on Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, selected based on traditional medicinal use, were evaluated on extracts from Hypericum species. Progenesis QI and EZinfo were used for chemometrics analysis to link the chemical profile and bioassay activity to aid in the identification of bioactive compounds. In total, 58 compounds were identified from the five species, including compounds with well-characterized bioactivity. Hypericum attenuatum, H. erectum, and H. perforatum, displayed the highest cytotoxicity, and contain the cytotoxic compounds petiolin A, prolificin A, and hypercohin G, respectively. Hypericum faberi and H. perforatum showed the highest anti-inflammatory activity, with pseudohypericin, quercetin and chlorogenic acid being observed at higher concentrations. Hypericum perforatum and H. erectum showed anti-plasmodial activity, with higher hyperforin and xanthones in these species that may account for the anti-plasmodial activity. This study characterized the chemical differences among five Hypericum species using metabolomics. These ethnomedically important species were tested for their biological activities in three distinct in vitro assays. The ethnobotanical data were useful for identifying bioactive Hypericum species. Hypericum attenuatum, H. erectum and H. faberi are promising phytotherapeutic species, although they are much less studied than H. perforatum, St. John's wort. Combining ethnobotanical surveys with chemometric analyses and bioactivity screening can greatly enhance the discovery of promising active constituents.",['Ji Y; Zhang R; Bensalel J; Morcol T; Gu R; Gallego-Delgado J; Kennelly EJ; Long C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38588986,"plants in the genus Hypericum (Hypericaceae) include more than 500 species worldwide. many are valued for their medicinal properties, and are used as traditional herbal medicines. only H. perforatum is officially recognized as herbal drug in several pharmacopoeias."
Cervical Cancer Genetic Profile through Circulating Tumor DNA: What Can We Learn from Blood?,"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the deadliest gynecological cancers worldwide. Human papillomavirus is the main etiological agent responsible for the initiation and development of most CC cases. The standard method utilized for CC screening in the global population is the cytological Pap smear test. Despite its effective validity in detecting precancerous lesions and its response to layer stages of this disease, greater screening and diagnostic reliability are needed, as well as an improvement in specificity and sensitivity. In this context, the use of liquid biopsies, like blood, for the isolation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in CC screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance could fill the gaps that still exist. In the present review, we aim to study the literature in order to collect knowledge on blood-based liquid biopsy based on descriptions of its precious molecular content and its utilization as a potential tool for CC patients' management. We will mainly focus on the important role of the novel ctDNA and the unique possibilities to additionally use HPV-ctDNA in CC at various stages of clinical application.",['Antonouli S; Di Nisio V; Daponte N; Daponte AI; Daponte A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39062539,CC is one of the deadliest gynecological cancers worldwide. human papillomavirus is the main etiological agent responsible for the initiation and development of most CC cases. the standard method used for CC screening in the global population is the cytological pap smear test.
The risk and impact of organophosphate esters on the development of female-specific cancers: Comparative analysis of patients with benign and malignant tumors.,"Environmental pollution has become a concern for public health. As endocrine disruptors, organophosphate esters (OPEs) causes many diseases via human exposure. However, there is limited research on the risk of OPE exposure to female-specific cancers. Blood measurements are biomarkers for chemical exposures by their definition. Thus, in the present study, 11 OPEs were analyzed in the plasma of patients with 4 female-specific tumors. 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) was detected at the highest levels in all groups. The Spearman correlation test results showed significantly positive correlations between some OPEs in each group, which indicated that those OPEs had similar sources and/or behaved similarly in the patients of each group. However, compared with different patient groups, obvious differences in the correlation results were noted, implying the differences in the metabolism of OPEs between different groups. The results of the correlation analysis showed that EHDPP concentration was associated with the risk of breast cancer (p < 0.05), while tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and EHDPP concentrations were associated with the risk of cervical cancer (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01).

The goal of this research was to understand women's lived experiences of sanitation by documenting their urination-related, defecation-related and menstruation-related concerns, to use findings to develop a definition of <i>sanitation insecurity</i> among women in low-income settings and to develop a conceptual model to explain the factors that contribute to their experiences, including potential behavioural and health consequences. We conducted 69 Free-List Interviews and eight focus group discussions in a rural population in Odisha, India to identify women's sanitation concerns and to build an understanding of sanitation insecurity. We found that women at different life stages in rural Odisha, India have a multitude of unaddressed urination, defecation and menstruation concerns. Concerns fell into four domains: the sociocultural context, the physical environment, the social environment and personal constraints. These varied by season, time of day, life stage and toilet ownership, and were linked with an array of adaptations (ie, suppression, withholding food and water) and consequences (ie, scolding, shame, fear). Our derived definition and conceptual model of sanitation insecurity reflect these four domains. To sincerely address women's sanitation needs, our findings indicate that more is needed than facilities that change the physical environment alone. Efforts to enable urinating, defecating and managing menstruation independently, comfortably, safely, hygienically, privately, healthily, with dignity and as needed require transformative approaches that also address the gendered, sociocultural and social environments that impact women despite facility access. This research lays the groundwork for future sanitation studies to validate or refine the proposed definition and to assess women's sanitation insecurity, even among those who have latrines, to determine what may be needed to improve women's sanitation circumstances.",['Caruso BA; Clasen TF; Hadley C; Yount KM; Haardörfer R; Rout M; Dasmohapatra M; Cooper HL'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29071131,"research suggests that the lived experience of inadequate sanitation may contribute to poor health outcomes above and beyond pathogen exposure. the goal of this research was to understand women's lived experiences of sanitation by documenting their urination-related, defecation-related and menstruation-related concerns."
The impact of premenstrual syndrome on women's quality of life - a myth or a fact?,"The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (QoL) of women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The study involved 231 regularly menstruating women aged 18 years and older. The research was carried out from July 2018 to November 2018 at St. Maksymilian Maria Kolbe Catholic Secondary School in Szczecin, Non-Public Healthcare Center ""MEDI-PLUS"" in Zwierzyno, and by electronic means. The research instruments used in the study were: the author's questionnaire concerning the severity of individual PMS symptoms (based on the APA criteria for PMDD, included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.), and the standardized World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 24 statistical package. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. The level of statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. The QoL of women with PMS was at a medium level. Emotional symptoms were the most severe ones (p = 0.010). The highest QoL scores were obtained for the social relationship domain (p = 0.002), and the lowest for the mental health domain (p = 0.006). PMS involves significant morbidity, and the health burden it causes is still not fully assessed.

Chronic and Cumulative Adverse Life Events in Women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency: An Exploratory Qualitative Study.,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) has serious physical and psychological consequences due to estradiol deprivation, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. However, the causes of most POI cases remain unknown. Psychological stress, usually caused by stressful life events, is known to be negatively associated with ovarian function. It is important to explore high-frequency adverse life events among women with POI for future interventions. Forty-three women (mean age=33·8 years) were recruited who were newly- diagnosed with idiopathic POI (FSH levels >40 IU/L) to participate in semi-structured interviews through convenience sampling. The main questions covered by the topic guide were designed to explore adverse life events prior to POI diagnosis. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Data were analyzed from June 2019 to August 2020. Among the women with POI, mean age at diagnosis of POI was 33·8 years (range from 19 to 39 years), and the average time between the onset of irregular menstruation and POI diagnosis was 2.3 years. These women with POI had a relatively normal menstrual cycle before the diagnosis. A number of stressful life events prior to POI diagnosis were discussed by them as important factors influencing their health. Four core themes emerged: 1) persistent exposure to workplace stress, 2) persistent exposure to family-related adverse life events, 3) sleep problem/disturbance existed in women with POI before diagnosis, and 4) participants' general cognition and concerns about POI. Persistent exposures to adverse life events related to work stress, family stress and sleep problem existed in women with POI. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adverse life events play a role in the development of POI. Future research should investigate how social environmental factors influence POI disease risks, and whether provision of tailored interventions (i.e. preventing or mitigating impact of adverse life events) aimed at high-risk populations may help prevent new POI cases and improve conditions of women with POI. We gained an in-depth understanding of the experiences of these women <i>via</i> 1:1 qualitative method, and find adverse life events are frequent in women with POI prior to the diagnosis.",['Sun J; Fan Y; Guo Y; Pan H; Zhang C; Mao G; Huang Y; Li B; Gu T; Wang L; Zhang Q; Wang Q; Zhou Q; Li B; Lai D'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35813658,"ovarian insufficiency (POI) has serious physical and psychological consequences due to estradiol deprivation. psychological stress, usually caused by stressful life events, is known to be negatively associated with ovarian function. 40 women were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews through convenience sampling."
Clinical Spectrum of Long COVID: Effects on Female Reproductive Health.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has presented numerous health challenges, including long-term COVID, which affects female reproductive health. This review consolidates the current research on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the menstrual cycle, ovarian function, fertility, and overall gynecological health. This study emphasizes the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors in viral entry and the subsequent tissue-specific pathological effects. It also explores the potential influence of long COVID on hormonal balance and immune responses, contributing to menstrual irregularities and impaired ovarian function. The findings indicate a higher prevalence of long-term COVID-19 among women, highlighting the substantial implications for reproductive health and the need for sex-sensitive longitudinal studies. Enhanced surveillance and targeted research are essential to develop effective interventions that prioritize women's reproductive well-being following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review advocates for a sex-informed approach to ongoing COVID-19 research and healthcare strategies, aiming to provide up-to-date and pertinent data for healthcare providers and the general public, ultimately improving outcomes for females affected by long COVID.",['Maham S; Yoon MS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066303,long-term COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has presented numerous health challenges. review consolidates current research on impact of long-term COVID.
The 3-year follow-up of a fully biodegradable implantable device closure for perimembranous ventricular septal defects in children using echocardiography.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the morphologic changes of a novel fully biodegradable implantable device after closing a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) and to evaluate the effect of the occluder on the myocardial function in patients during a 3-year follow-up period. One-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-ups were carried out after implantation with a total of 30 Pm-VSD patients who had successful closure by the fully biodegradable occluder. In total, 30 healthy children were enrolled as controls. At discharge and at every follow-up visit, the lengths of the left and right discs of the novel device were measured in the apical three- and four-chamber as well as short-axis views. At the end of the follow-up, using three-dimensional speckle-tracking conditions, the values of myocardial deformation, including global longitudinal strain, global circumferential strain, and global area strain, were acquired. The fully bioabsorbable double-disc occluder gradually decreased over time and was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning during the follow-up (<i>p </i>< 0.05). At the end of the third year, there were no significant differences in the myocardial deformation parameters between the cases implanted with the novel devices and the controls; no significant differences were found between the basal segments of the ventricle septa and that of the left ventricle (LV) free wall among the patients who completed the Pm-VSD closure using the fully biodegradable occluder (<i>p </i>> 0.05). The novel fully biodegradable occluder is a safe, effective, and perfect alternative for the treatment of VSD. Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the follow-up of this new type of occluder implantation.",['Cong J; Cui C; Huang D; Wang Y; Liu S; Song S; Fan T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39015679,the study was carried out after a 3-year follow-up period with 30 patients. the occluder closed a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) the occluder was a fully biodegradable implantable device. the occluder was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning.
The association between breastfeeding and breast cancer occurrence among Israeli Jewish women: a case control study.,"Breast cancer remains the major malignant disease among Israeli women, with about 4,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and a steadily increasing incidence rates. Early in this century investigators noted that nulliparity and a history of never having breastfed were more common in women with breast cancer than without the disease. Epidemiological evidence on those issues remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to clarify those controversial. A hospital-based case control study was carried out at Nahariya hospital (North of Israel) to assess the risk of breast cancer in relation to breastfeeding history. A total of 256 recent cases of breast cancer (diagnosed between January 1999 and February 2005) and 536 controls were included. Detailed information regarding breastfeeding, menstruation, reproductive factors and confounders was collected. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Short duration of lifetime breastfeeding, late age at first breastfeeding and experience of insufficient milk were found to increase breast cancer risk. When women who had ever breastfed their infants were compared with females who had not, breastfeeding was found to be protective (OR of 0.39; 95% CI 0.26-0.59). These findings may have significant impact on intervention planning aimed towards breast cancer reduction among Israeli Jewish women.",['Shema L; Ore L; Ben-Shachar M; Haj M; Linn S'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17453241,"breast cancer remains the major malignant disease among Israeli women. about 4,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and a steadily increasing incidence rates. epidemiological evidence on those issues remains controversial."
Biological variability in serum anti-Müllerian hormone throughout the menstrual cycle in ovulatory and sporadic anovulatory cycles in eumenorrheic women.,"Does serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) vary significantly throughout both ovulatory and sporadic anovulatory menstrual cycles in healthy premenopausal women? Serum AMH levels vary statistically significantly across the menstrual cycle in both ovulatory and sporadic anovulatory cycles of healthy eumenorrheic women. Studies to date evaluating serum AMH levels throughout the menstrual cycle have conflicting results regarding intra-woman cyclicity. No previous studies have evaluated an association between AMH and sporadic anovulation. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 259 regularly menstruating women recruited between 2005 and 2007. Women aged 18-44 years were followed for one (n = 9) or two (n = 250) menstrual cycles. Anovulatory cycles were defined as any cycle with peak progesterone concentration ≤5 ng/ml and no serum LH peak on the mid or late luteal visits. Serum AMH was measured at up to eight-time points throughout each cycle. Geometric mean AMH levels were observed to vary across the menstrual cycle (P < 0.01) with the highest levels observed during the mid-follicular phase at 2.06 ng/ml, decreasing around the time of ovulation to 1.79 ng/ml and increasing thereafter to 1.93 (mid-follicular versus ovulation, P < 0.01; ovulation versus late luteal, P = 0.01; mid-follicular versus late luteal, P = 0.05). Patterns were similar across all age groups and during ovulatory and anovulatory cycles, with higher levels of AMH observed among women with one or more anovulatory cycles (P = 0.03). Ovulatory status was not verified by direct visualization. AMH was analyzed using the original Generation II enzymatically amplified two-site immunoassay, which has been shown to be susceptible to assay interference. Thus, absolute levels should be interpreted with caution, however, patterns and associations remain consistent and any potential bias would be non-differential. This study demonstrates a significant variation in serum AMH levels across the menstrual cycle regardless of ovulatory status. This variability, although statistically significant, is not large enough to warrant a change in current clinical practice to time AMH measurements to cycle day/phase. This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (Contracts # HHSN275200403394C, HHSN275201100002I Task 1 HHSN27500001).

Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer in Ghana.,"The major burden of cervical cancer occurs in low- and middle-income countries. In Ghana, it is the second most common cancer among women. Infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) has been established as the cause of cervical cancer. As such, it is important to identify risk factors that may affect progression from HPV infection to cancer. We assessed the risk factors assocaited with cervical cancer in Ghana. To identify the risk factors for cervical cancer, we conducted an unmatched case-control study in two hospitals in Ghana where most cervical cancer cases are diagnosed. Women with histologically confirmed cervical cancer were the cases, whereas women without cancer seeking care at the two hospitals were controls. A structured questionnaire was administered to the women, after which cervical samples were sent for HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. Overall, 206 cases and 230 controls were recruited. After adjusting for possible confounders, women with the highest educational level had a significantly lower risk of cervical cancer than those with no or little formal education. Parity was a major risk factor (odd ratio [OR] for five or more children = 7.9; 95% CI: 2.3-27.6), with risk increasing with increasing parity (p for trend <0.001). Women reporting the use of a homemade sanitary towel during menstruation also had an increased risk of cervical cancer compared with women who used a pad (OR: 7.3; 95% CI: 2.5-22.0). In this Ghanaian population, high parity and poor personal hygienic conditions were the main contributing factors to the risk of cervical cancer after adjustment for the presence of high-risk HPV genotypes.",['Nartey Y; Amo-Antwi K; Hill PC; Dassah ET; Asmah RH; Nyarko KM; Agambire R; Konney TO; Yarney J; Damale N; Cox B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39031901,"in Ghana, it is the second most common cancer among women. in the country, it is the second most common cancer among women."
"Premenstrual syndrome, a common but underrated entity: review of the clinical literature.","Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are characterized by somatic and psychologic symptoms that arise at the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and subside with menstruation. For definitive diagnosis prospectively self-reported symptoms should demonstrate a cyclic pattern and other psychological pathologies and thyroid dysfunction, that may present with similar symptoms, should be excluded. Both entities affect millions of women at reproductive age as the prevalence of PMS is given as 10-98% while PMDD affects 2-8%. Sex steroids and neurotransmitters have a central role in the etiology. The role of vitamins and minerals in the etiology and treatment of PMS and PMDD is open to discussion. Drugs that suppress ovarian sex steroid production, such as combined oral contraceptives or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors enhancing central serotonin delivery are used for treatment. Life-style changes and regular exercise also have a positive effect in milder cases.

Childless by circumstance - Using an online survey to explore the experiences of childless women who had wanted children.,"Childlessness is increasing globally. This study aimed to explore the experiences of childless women who had wanted children. An online survey study was promoted through social media to recruit women aged ≥46 years who were childless by circumstance. The survey remained open for 15 days. In total, 303 survey responses were collected, 176 of which were complete surveys. In total, 15.3% (27/176) of women who had wanted children reported that they had not tried to have children, most commonly due to the lack of a partner (40.7%, 11/27). Of the 139 women who had tried to have children, 70.5% (98/139) had used calendar-based menstrual cycle tracking methods to identify their fertile window, and many had undergone fertility checks including hormone tests (75.5%, 105/139) and ultrasound scans (71.2%, 99/139). A significant proportion of women had experienced a miscarriage (40.2%, 56/139). Many women had decided not to have any fertility treatment (43.2%, 60/139). For those who did, the majority had tried in-vitro fertilization (74.6%, 59/79). The most common reason that women gave for stopping fertility treatment was due to emotional reasons (74.7%, 59/79). When asked how women felt now about their childlessness, the most common issues identified were unhappiness (85/158, 54%), acceptance (43/158, 27%) and happiness (30/158, 19%). There should be more support for unsuccessful fertility patients and other childless women, and more emphasis should be placed upon fertility education in order to ensure that women are better informed about fertility issues.",['Chauhan D; Jackson E; Harper JC'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33336089,"online survey was promoted through social media to recruit women aged 46 years who were childless by circumstance. 303 survey responses were collected, 176 of which were complete surveys. 15.3% of women who had wanted children reported that they had not tried to have children."

"Menstrual attitudes in adult women: A cross-sectional study on the association with menstruation factors, contraceptive use, genital self-image, and sexual openness.","Menstruation is a central part of the everyday life of most women, and menstrual attitudes may impact health and well-being. This article aimed to map menstrual attitudes among adult women and examine factors associated with these attitudes, such as aspects of menarche and current menstruation, and rarely studied factors, such as genital self-image and sexual openness. A cross-sectional online survey. A sample of 1470 women, aged 18-50 years, were recruited through social media sites. The <i>Menstrual Self-Evaluation Scale</i> was used to measure three different attitudes: menstruation as natural, shameful, and bothersome. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between each attitude and factors related to menarche and current menstruation, contraceptive use, genital self-image (assessed by <i>Female Genital Self-Image Scale</i>), and sexual openness (<i>Personal Comfort with Sexuality Scale</i>). Sociodemographic variables were included into the models as covariates. Agreeing with the attitude of menstruation as something natural was predicted primarily by positive emotions at menarche, experiencing less menstrual pain, using no or nonhormonal contraception, and having a positive genital self-image. Perceiving menstruation as bothersome was predicted by a lower educational level, experiencing stronger menstrual pain, having more perimenstrual psychological symptoms, and using hormonal contraceptives. Menstruation as something shameful was chiefly predicted by lower sexual openness and a negative genital self-image. Many women held attitudes about menstruation as both something natural and bothersome. Menarche and current menstruation experiences, and contraceptive method, played central roles in shaping attitudes toward menstruation as natural and bothersome. Viewing menstruation as shameful stood out from other attitudes by indicating a triad of self-objectified shame that includes menstruation, sexuality, and genital self-image. Further research into the relationships between menstruation, contraceptive use, sexuality, and body image is needed to enhance our understanding of women's menstrual health.",['Kvalem IL; Dahr Nygaard IM; Træen B; Ivanova A; Dahlgren CL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38682834,study aims to map menstrual attitudes among adult women. study aims to examine factors associated with menstruation factors. study aims to map menstrual attitudes among adult women.
The use of digital platforms and physical activity practice in a population from southern Brazil: Findings from the PAMPA Cohort.,"We aimed to identify the factors associated with using digital platforms for physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic among adults living in Southern Brazil. We also compared the trajectory of physical activity between users and non-users and by type of digital platform used. We analyzed data from the PAMPA (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health in Adults) cohort. The study started in June 2020, and tracked participants through three waves (December 2020, June 2021, and June 2022). The exposure variable was usingf digital platforms for physical activity. The outcome measure was minutes per week of physical activity. We employed a generalized linear model with robust variance to explore the interaction between time and the use of digital platforms, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and the presence of chronic diseases. The proportion of participants using digital platforms for physical activity declined from 36.8% in 2020 to 25.6% in 2021 and further to 13.5% in 2022. Using digital platforms for physical activity was associated with a higher mean daily physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who used digital platforms were more likely to be physically active when compared to their inactive contemparts throughout the entire study period. Notably, social media emerged with greater influence in the physical activity practice among digital platforms.

"Magnitude and associated factors of sexual violence among female housemaids attending night school in Bahir Dar City, Northwest Ethiopia: Institution-Based Cross-Sectional Study, 2022.","Sexual violence is a major public health problem that affects the health and well-being of millions of young people. Housemaids are the most vulnerable group to sexual violence due to their nature of work. It leads to various physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health problems, especially in our country's context. However, they have limited information regarding the magnitude and the factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and risk factors for sexual violence among female housemaids attending night school in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia, in 2022. An institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 340 housemaids attending night school in Bahir Dar city from May 15 to June 20, 2022. Participants were selected using simple random sampling through computer-generated techniques. An interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire was used. Data were entered, coded, and cleaned using EPI Data version 4.6.0.2, and exported to SPSS version 26 for further analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were done to identify factors associated with sexual violence. P-value and 95% confidence interval were used to declare the statistical association. The magnitude of sexual violence after being a housemaid was 30.3% with a 95% confidence interval (25.3-35.38). Ever had sex [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 4.67; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (2.60, 8.39)], no discussion of sexual and reproductive issues [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 2.32; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (1.29, 4.16)], poor social support [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 2.69; 95%; Confidence Interval(CI) (1.32, 5.52)], were identified as factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. Similarly, academic performance [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.96; 95%; Confidence Interval (CI) (0.93, 0.99)], and distance to reach school [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.04; 95%; Confidence Interval (CI) (1.19, 3.48)] were identified as factors associated with sexual violence among housemaids. This study identified that the magnitude of sexual violence among housemaids was high. Housemaids who ever had sex, no discussion of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) with anyone, poor social support, poor academic performance, and distance to reach school were factors associated with sexual violence. Therefore, creating a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) discussion session for housemaids is important for securing their sexual rights.",['Gebremariam SA; Gebey MY; Yadita ZS; Bekele YA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39079166,"340 housemaids attended night school in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia. the study was conducted by an institution-based cross-sectional study design. the study was conducted among 340 housemaids attending night school in 2022."
"[Efficacy and safety of mini-track, mini-nephroscopy and mini-ultrasonic probe percutaneous nephrolithotomy for the treatment of 1.5-2.5 cm kidney stones].","To investigate the efficacy and safety of mini-track, mini-nephroscopy and mini-ultrasonic probe percutaneous nephrolithotomy (3mPCNL) for the treatment of 1.5-2.5 cm kidney stones. The perioperative data and postoperative follow-up data of a total of 25 patients with about 1.5-2.5 cm kidney stones who underwent 3mPCNL under ultrasound guidance in Peking University People's Hospital from November 2023 to January 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. During the matching period, the 25 patients with 1.5-2.5 cm kidney stones receiving standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy (sPCNL) were matched one-to-one according to the criterion that the absolute difference of the maximum diameter of stones between the two groups was less than 1 mm. The operative time, renal function changes, postoperative stone-free rate, hemoglobin changes, and complication rate of the two treatments were compared, and then the effectiveness and safety of 3mPCNL were preliminarily analyzed. There were no significant differences in mean age, preoperative median creatinine, preoperative mean hemoglobin, preoperative mean hematocrit, median stone maximum diameter, and median stone CT density between the 3mPCNL group and the sPCNL group. The median operation time in the 3mPCNL group was 60.0 (45.0-110.0) min, with no statistical significance compared with the sPCNL group, and all the patients underwent single-channel operations. The mean hemoglobin after operation in the 3mPCNL group was (115.3±15.5) mmol/L, and there was no significant difference between the preoperative group and the sPCNL group, and the mean hemoglobin decreased significantly between the sPCNL group and the sPCNL group [(9.5±2.2) mmol/L <i>vs</i>. (10.1±1.9) mmol/L]. The mean hematocrit after operation was (28.0±5.2)%, and the difference was statistically significant compared with that before operation (<i>t</i>=2.414, <i>P</i>=0.020). The mean hematocrit drop was not statistically signi-ficant compared with the sPCNL group (2.3% <i>vs</i>. 2.7%). The median serum creatinine in the 3mPCNL group was 74.0 (51.0-118.0) μmol/L after operation, and the difference was statistically significant compared with that before operation (<i>Z</i>=-2.980, <i>P</i>=0.005). The stone-free rate in the 3mPCNL group and the sPCNL group was 96.0% and 97.3%, respectively, and the mean hospital stay was (4.3± 1.4) d and (5.5±2.0) d, respectively, with the statistical significance (<i>t</i>=0.192, <i>P</i>=0.025). After the operation, one patient in sPCNL group had massive hemorrhage after the nephrostomy tube was removed, which was improved after selective renal artery embolization. One patient in the 3mPCNL group developed mild perirenal hematoma, which was improved after conservative treatment, and no complications were observed in the other patients. 3mPCNL in the treatment of 1.5-2.5 cm kidney stones can achieve an effective rate comparable to sPCNL, and can achieve the ideal stone-free rate in a shorter operative time with a lower rate of surgery-related complications.",['Wang M; Liu J; Xiong L; Yu L; Hu H; Xu K; Xu T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39041553,"mini-track, mini-nephroscopy and mini-ultrasonic probe percutaneous nephrolithotomy were matched one-to-one. the results were retrospectively analyzed. the difference between the two groups was less than 1 mm."
Evaluation of the Changes of Blood Pressure and Serum Calcium Level In Postmenopausal Women.,"Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation at the end of the reproductive life due to loss of ovarian follicular activity. The prevalence of hypertension in women increases after menopause, suggesting that an absence of female gonadal steroids may represent a major risk factor for postmenopausal hypertension. Menopause is the phase from where bone mineralization becomes critics because of various physiological and hormonal changes. Estrogen deficiency and age related processes alter the rate of calcium turnover in bone that the ageing women face. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure is significantly higher and serum calcium level is significantly lower among post menopausal women as compared with reproductive aged women. The objective of the study was to assess the blood pressure and serum calcium level changes in healthy postmenopausal women in order to compare this parameter with healthy reproductive aged women. This comparative study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2018 to June 2019. Two hundred healthy women (100 female were postmenopausal as study group and 100 female were reproductive aged women as control group) aged between 25 to 65 years were enrolled in this study. Blood pressure was measured by indirect auscultatory method with an aneroid sphygmomanometer and serum calcium level of the individual was measured by enzymatic colorimetric method with o-cresoftaline-complexon. Data were expressed as mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the group was calculated by unpaired students' 't' test. The mean value ±SD of blood pressure was higher and serum calcium level was lower in postmenopausal group in comparison to the reproductive women group. This study concludes, blood pressure increases and serum calcium level decreases in postmenopausal women.",['Dipa MI; Nessa A; Firoz S; Aktar N; Israt S; Sharmin A'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32844787,menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation at the end of the reproductive life due to loss of ovarian follicular activity. prevalence of hypertension in women increases after menopause. an absence of female gonadal steroids may represent a major risk factor for postmenopausal hypertension.
The impact of polycystic ovary syndrome on the health-related quality of life: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, the relative degree of impairment in each domain differed among samples, and it was not clear which aspect of disease-specific HRQOL (modified polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life questionnaire) was most negatively affected. To systematically review the effects of PCOS on specific domains of HRQOL. Literature search using search engine of database (PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Scopus) between 1998 to December 2013 yields 6 relevant publications. Pairs of raters used structural tools to analyze these articles, through critical appraisal and data extraction. The scores of each domain of polycystic ovarian syndrome questionnaire (PCOSQ) or modified version (MPCOSQ) of 1140 women with PCOS were used in meta-analysis. The combine mean of emotional (4.40; 95% CI 3.77-5.04), infertility (4.13; 95% CI 3.81-4.45) and weight (3.88; 95% CI 2.33-5.42) dimensions were better, but menstruation (3.84; 95% CI 3.63-4.04) and hirsutism (3.81; 95% CI 3.26-4.35) domains were lower than the mean score of PCOSQ/MPCOSQ in related dimension. The meta-analysis showed that the most affected domains in specific HRQOL were hirsutism and menstruation. Based on these findings, we recommend healthcare providers to be made aware that HRQOL impairment of PCOS is mainly caused by their hirsutism and menstruation, which requires appropriate management.",['Bazarganipour F; Taghavi SA; Montazeri A; Ahmadi F; Chaman R; Khosravi A'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999994,"polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) however, the relative degree of impairment in each domain differed among samples. it was not clear which aspect of disease-specific HRQOL was most negatively affected."
The use of preventive healthcare by Canadian women who drink alcohol.,"Despite established links among heavy alcohol consumption, other poor health behaviors, and poor health status, no Canadian study has specifically addressed the relationship between drinking and the use of preventive healthcare services. This study examines the relationship between drinking and female-specific preventive health service use through a secondary analysis of the 1996-1997 NPHS. Recent use of Pap smears and mammograms was examined in relation to current alcohol consumption, using multivariate logistic regression (weighted n = 25,095). In general, there was a trend toward greater odds of recent service use among light and moderate drinkers than among heavy drinkers and lifetime abstainers. However, only moderate drinkers were significantly (P < 0.01) more likely than abstainers to have recently had a Pap smear. The trend toward lower use of preventive services by heavy drinkers is concerning considering the established harmful effects of prolonged alcohol consumption on health and the tendency for multiple risk behaviors to cluster together in the same individuals. Early detection of departures from good health may alleviate the elevated use of healthcare services among those diagnosed with alcohol use disorders.",['Urbanoski KA'],2003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14507490,no study has specifically addressed the relationship between drinking and preventive healthcare services. recent use of Pap smears and mammograms was examined in relation to current alcohol consumption.
Case report: catamenial hyperglycemia: the trigger of recurrent DKA in a female patient with three-year follow-up.,"Catamenial hyperglycemia is a rare type of spontaneous, recurring Diabetic Ketoacidosis(DKA) in females during the luteal phase, most commonly observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Even with controlled serum glucose levels, adherence to a diabetic diet, medications, and in the absence of other common influencing factors such as infection, glucose levels tend to increase during the premenstrual period. This uncommon issue related to the menstrual cycle phase has not been extensively researched. Therefore, this study aims to diagnose catamenial hyperglycemia promptly and initiate early treatment to prevent complications. We presented a case of a 19-year-old girl who experienced recurrent DKA during the premenstrual period, without an apparent cause. She was admitted multiple times to various hospitals and sought consultations, undergoing numerous laboratory and imaging examinations, yet the etiology remained elusive. Ultimately, she received a diagnosis of catamenial diabetic hyperglycemia. To prevent recurrence of complications associated with catamenial hyperglycemia, we initiated a comprehensive approach which included continuous glucose monitoring, adherence to a strict diabetic diet, diabetic health education, regular exercise, timely medication administration, and increase in insulin dosage during the premenstrual period based on glucose levels. Although catamenial hyperglycemia is rare, it should be considered a cause of recurrent hyperglycemia in any postpubertal female to prevent complications. The specific underlying mechanisms responsible for catamenial hyperglycemia or DKA remain unidentified.",['Cholekho S; Fan Z; Tan H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38444588,"catamenial hyperglycemia is a rare type of spontaneous, recurring Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in females during the luteal phase. this rare issue related to the menstrual cycle phase has not been extensively researched."
Individualized luteal phase support in frozen-thawed embryo transfer after intramuscular progesterone administration might rectify live birth rate.,"The serum P concentrations are suggested to have an impact on pregnancy outcome. However there is no consensus about the optimal progesterone cut-off during the luteal phase. Few studies evaluated the effectiveness of a ""rescue protocol"" for low serum P concentrations and most of these studies used vaginal progesterone administration. There is paucity of data on the effectiveness of rescue protocol using intramuscular progesterone (IM-P) in frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). This study is a retrospective cohort study included 637 single or double blastocyst FETs with artificially prepared endometrium receiving 100 mg IM progesterone (P) after incremental estrogen treatment. Serum P concentrations were evaluated using blood samples obtained 117-119 hours after the first IM-P administration and 21 ± 2 hours after the last IM-P administration. Patients with serum P concentrations <20.6 ng/ml on the ET day were administrated 400 mg vaginal progesterone for rescue. Demographic and cycle characteristics were similar between patients receiving rescue vaginal P (embryo transfer (ET)-day P concentration < 20.6 ng/ml) and patients who did not need rescue vaginal P (ET-day P concentration ≥ 20.6 ng/ml). Clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates were similar between two groups: 52.9%(45/85) vs 59.6%(326/552), p=0.287; 11.1%(5/45) vs 14.1%(46/326), p=0.583; and 47.1%(40/85) vs 50.7%(280/552), p=0.526, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the female age (p = 0.008, OR=0.942, 95% CI = 0.902-0.984) and embryo quality (ref: good quality for moderate: p=0.02, OR=0.469, 95% CI =0.269-0.760; for poor: p=0.013, OR= 0.269, 95% CI = 0.092-0.757) were independent variables for live birth. Following rescue protocol implementation, ET-day P concentration was not a significant predictor of live birth. Rescue vaginal P administration for low ET day serum P concentrations following IM-P yields comparable live birth rates.",['Boynukalin FK; Tohma YA; Yarkıner Z; Gultomruk M; Bozdag G; Ozkavukcu S; Bahçeci M; Demir B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39006366,intramuscular progesterone administration may reduce live birth rate. luteal phase support may be a good choice for luteal phase support. luteal phase support may be a good choice for pregnancy.
The 22nd Annual Meeting of the Japan Academy of Diabetes Education and Nursing Education Lecture 4 Women's Health Support Network for Diabetic Women.,"Women with diabetes may face health concerns such as menstruation issues, maternal and fetal problems during pregnancy and gynecological diseases, as they are subject to the effects of sex-related and pregnancyrelated hormones that are insulin resistant, adipose cells that act as a supply source of insulin resistance and estrogen after menopause, diabetic angiopathy, increased susceptibility to infection, and other vulnerabilities particular to diabetes. In addition, diabetic treatment and self-care affect their lives as women and mothers, and impact the psycho-social aspects of their lives. To improve diabetic women's QOL, optimal health care in accordance with their life stages is essential. As obstetricians and gynecologists, the usual providers of women's health care, are in short supply, an interprofessional support system must be built in each region to assist nursing professionals who treat diabetic women to collaborate, beyond the scope of their specialties, in supporting these women. This support system should include the women concerned, their families and school officials. With an aim to establish bases to provide support for diabetic women and their physical and psychological issues throughout Japan, we have been conducting studies and putting the results into practice by constructing an interactive support network covering sexuality, pregnancy and childbirth among diabetic women. With the diabetes life support study group for women as a base, a website was launched in 2014 to provide a portal through which we have been offering information and seminars and developing support methods. Future issues to be addressed include securing human and financial bases, information network activities using SNS, and strengthening organizational structures.",['Tanaka K'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34690205,"women with diabetes may face health concerns such as menstruation issues. sex-related and pregnancy-related hormones are insulin resistant. adipose cells act as a supply source of insulin resistance and estrogen after menopause. diabetic angiopathy, increased susceptibility to infection, and other vulnerabilities."
"Current Use and Discrepancies in the Adoption of Health-Related Internet of Things and Apps Among Working Women in Japan: Large-Scale, Internet-Based, Cross-Sectional Survey.","Demographic changes and a low birth rate have led to a workforce shortage in Japan. To address this issue, the government has promoted engagement of female employment. However, increased female employment can impact women's health. Using Internet of Things (IoT) and apps to manage women's health has gained attention, but few studies have focused on working women. This study aimed to clarify the current situation of working women and their use of IoT or apps to manage their health. A large-scale, nationwide internet survey was conducted among 10,000 female participants aged from 20 years to 64 years in Japan. Participants were recruited from a marketing research company's active survey panel of 5.24 million members. The survey included questions about health status, sociodemographic factors, psychological characteristics, and the use of IoT or apps for health management. We compared perceived health status and reasons for current IoT use using t tests and assessed participant characteristics that predicted IoT use using the C5.0 decision tree algorithm. Ethical approval was granted by St. Luke's International University. Among participants, 14.6% (1455/10,000) currently used IoT or apps, 7% (695/10,000) used them previously, and 78.5% (7850/10,000) had never used them. Current users (42.7 years old) were older than past users (39.7 years old). Discrepancies were observed between participants' perceived health problems and the purpose for using IoT or apps, with 21.3% (2130/10,000) of all women reporting they experienced menstrual symptoms or disorders but only 3.5% (347/10,000) used IoT or apps to manage the same symptom. On the other hand, current users were more likely to use IoT or apps to manage nutrition-related problems such as underweight or obesity (405/1455, 27.8%). Device use was highest among current users, with 87.3% (1270/1455) using smartphones, 19.7% (287/1455) using smartwatches, and 13.3% (194/1455) using PCs. Decision tree analysis identified 6 clusters, the largest consisting of 81.6% (5323/6523) of non-IoT users who did not exercise regularly, while pregnant women were more likely to use IoT or apps. Our findings highlight the idea that woman with particular health problems (ie, menstrual symptoms or disorders and premenstrual syndrome) have lower use of IoT or apps, suggesting an unmet need for IoT and apps in specific areas.",['Sasayama K; Nishimura E; Yamaji N; Ota E; Tachimori H; Igarashi A; Arata N; Yoneoka D; Saito E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39083338,"internet of Things (IoT) and apps to manage women's health has gained attention. a large-scale, nationwide internet survey was conducted among 10,000 female participants aged from 20 years to 64 years in Japan."
A Review of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Transgender and Gender Diverse Adults in South Korea.,"Recently, gender-affirming hormone therapy for gender incongruence has become an issue in various countries and organizations with various guidelines. In South Korea, several clinical treatments are also used with many possible options. These treatments include masculinizing (female-to-male [FTM]) or feminizing (male-to-female [MTF]) hormone therapies, with regimens usually driven by standards of hormonal replacement therapy for hypogonadism (i.e., hypogonadal natal men and postmenopausal women). This cross-sex hormone therapy can change patients' physical appearance to better match their gender identity and expression. Regarding masculinizing therapy, injection and transdermal gel types of testosterone are used according to international guidelines. Progesterone is utilized in the form of oral pills, injections, or intrauterine devices to suppress menstruation and avoid pregnancy. Essentially, feminizing therapy uses androgen blockers along with estrogen. This is because estrogen alone cannot exert sufficient androgen-suppressing effects. In South Korea, the most commonly used androgen blockers are spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is also available. Regarding estrogen, oral pills, injections, and transdermal gels are utilized. This review introduces these gender-affirming hormone therapies in South Korea and discusses the side effects of each regimen.",['Oh JW; Yun Y; Lee ES'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36647272,"gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender and gender diverse adults in south Korea has become an issue in various countries and organizations. in south Korea, several clinical treatments are also used with many possible options."
Cardiac effects of aldosterone: does gender matter?,"Ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to be the most common cause of death globally, although mortality rates are decreasing with significant advances in treatment. Higher prevalence of co-morbidities in women only partly explains the lack of decrease in mortality rates in younger women due to. Until recently there has been gender bias in pre-clinical studies and many clinical trials, resulting in a significant gap in knowledge whether there are differential responses to therapy for women, particularly younger women. There is increasing evidence that there are significant gender-specific differences in the outcome of post-infarction remodelling, prevalence of hypertension and sudden cardiac death. These differences indicate that cardiac tissue in females displays significant physiological and biochemical differences compared to males. However, the mechanisms mediating these differences, and how they change with age, are poorly understood. Circulating levels and physiological effects of aldosterone vary across the menstrual cycle suggesting female steroid sex hormones may not only regulate production of, but also responses to, aldosterone in pre-menopausal women. This modified tissue response may foster a homeostatic environment where higher levels of aldosterone are tolerated without adverse cardiac effect. Moreover, there is limited data on the direct regulation of this signalling axis by androgens in female animals/subjects. This review explores the relationship between gender and the effects of aldosterone in cardiovascular disease (CVD), an issue of significant need that may lead to changes in best practice to optimise clinical care and improve outcomes for females with CVD.",['Mihailidou AS; Ashton AW'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25173820,mortality rates are decreasing with significant advances in treatment. gender bias in pre-clinical studies and many clinical trials. there is a gap in knowledge whether there are differential responses to therapy for women.

Factors Underlying Reduced Hospitalizations for Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The incidence of hospital encounters for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) decreased sharply early in the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic levels. There has been an ongoing debate about what mechanism may underlie this decline, including patients avoiding the hospital for treatment, excess mortality from COVID-19 among patients who would otherwise have had an AMI, a reduction in the incidence or severity of AMIs due to pandemic-related changes in behavior, or a preexisting temporal trend of lower AMI incidence. To describe drivers of changing incidence in AMI hospital encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study used traditional Medicare claims from all patients enrolled in traditional Medicare from January 2016 to June 2023 (total of 2.85 billion patient-months) to calculate the rate of AMI hospital encounters (emergency department visits, observation stays, or inpatient admissions) per capita at all short-term acute care and critical access hospitals in the United States overall and by patient characteristics. Observed rates were compared with expected rates that accounted for shifts in population characteristics and the prepandemic temporal trend (as estimated over 2016-2019). Data were analyzed in November 2023. Hospital encounters for AMI. On average, the study sample included 31 623 928 patients each month from January 2016 through June 2023, for a total of 2 846 153 487 patient-months during the 90-month study period. In June 2023, there were 0.044 AMI hospital encounters per 100 patients, which was 20% lower than in June 2019 (0.055 encounters per 100 patients). Early in the pandemic, AMI rates moved inversely with COVID-19 death rates and tracked patterns seen for other painful acute conditions, such as nephrolithiasis, suggesting these changes were associated with care avoidance. Changes in patient characteristics driven by excess deaths during the pandemic explained little of the decline. Later in the pandemic, the decline may be explained by the long-standing downward trend in AMI incidence; by April 2022, the observed rate of encounters matched the expected rate that accounted for this trend. During the full pandemic period, from March 2020 to June 2023, there were an estimated 5% (95% prediction interval, 1%-9%) fewer AMI hospital encounters than expected. The early reduction in AMI encounters was likely driven by care avoidance, while ongoing reductions through June 2023 likely reflect long-standing temporal trends. During the pandemic, there were 5% fewer AMI encounters than expected.",['Wilcock AD; Zubizarreta JR; Wadhera RK; Yeh RW; Zachrison KS; Schwamm LH; Mehrotra A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39083317,incidence of hospital encounters for acute myocardial infarction decreased sharply early in the COVID-19 pandemic. there has been an ongoing debate about what mechanism may underlie this decline. there has been an ongoing debate about what mechanism may underlie this decline.
Transcriptional profiling of mucus production in rhesus macaque endocervical cells under hormonal regulation.,"Endocervical mucus production is a key regulator of fertility throughout the menstrual cycle. With cycle-dependent variability in mucus quality and quantity, cervical mucus can either facilitate or block sperm ascension into the upper female reproductive tract. This study seeks to identify genes involved in the hormonal regulation of mucus production, modification, and regulation through profiling the transcriptome of endocervical cells from the non-human primate, the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). We treated differentiated primary endocervical cultures with estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) to mimic peri-ovulatory and luteal-phase hormonal changes. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified differential expression of gene pathways and mucus producing and modifying genes in cells treated with E2 compared to hormone-free conditions and E2 compared to E2-primed cells treated with P4. We pursued differential gene expression analysis on RNA-sequenced cells. Sequence validation was done using qPCR. Our study identified 158 genes that show significant differential expression in E2-only conditions compared to hormone-free control, and 250 genes that show significant differential expression in P4-treated conditions compared to E2-only conditions. From this list, we found hormone-induced changes in transcriptional profiles for genes across several classes of mucus production, including ion channels and enzymes involved in post-translational mucin modification that have not previously been described as hormonally regulated. Our study is the first to use an in vitro culture system to create an epithelial-cell specific transcriptome of the endocervix. As a result, our study identifies new genes and pathways altered by sex-steroids in cervical mucus production.",['Rapp K; Wei S; Roberts M; Yao S; Fei SS; Gao L; Ray K; Wang A; Godiah R; Han L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39115371,endocervical mucus production is a key regulator of fertility throughout the menstrual cycle. cervical mucus can either facilitate or block sperm ascension into the upper female reproductive tract.
Longitudinal Assessment of Seasonal Impacts and Depression Associations on Circadian Rhythm Using Multimodal Wearable Sensing: Retrospective Analysis.,"Previous mobile health (mHealth) studies have revealed significant links between depression and circadian rhythm features measured via wearables. However, the comprehensive impact of seasonal variations was not fully considered in these studies, potentially biasing interpretations in real-world settings. This study aims to explore the associations between depression severity and wearable-measured circadian rhythms while accounting for seasonal impacts. Data were sourced from a large longitudinal mHealth study, wherein participants' depression severity was assessed biweekly using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and participants' behaviors, including sleep, step count, and heart rate (HR), were tracked via Fitbit devices for up to 2 years. We extracted 12 circadian rhythm features from the 14-day Fitbit data preceding each PHQ-8 assessment, including cosinor variables, such as HR peak timing (HR acrophase), and nonparametric features, such as the onset of the most active continuous 10-hour period (M10 onset). To investigate the association between depression severity and circadian rhythms while also assessing the seasonal impacts, we used three nested linear mixed-effects models for each circadian rhythm feature: (1) incorporating the PHQ-8 score as an independent variable, (2) adding seasonality, and (3) adding an interaction term between season and the PHQ-8 score. Analyzing 10,018 PHQ-8 records alongside Fitbit data from 543 participants (n=414, 76.2% female; median age 48, IQR 32-58 years), we found that after adjusting for seasonal effects, higher PHQ-8 scores were associated with reduced daily steps (β=-93.61, P<.001), increased sleep variability (β=0.96, P<.001), and delayed circadian rhythms (ie, sleep onset: β=0.55, P=.001; sleep offset: β=1.12, P<.001; M10 onset: β=0.73, P=.003; HR acrophase: β=0.71, P=.001). Notably, the negative association with daily steps was more pronounced in spring (β of PHQ-8 × spring = -31.51, P=.002) and summer (β of PHQ-8 × summer = -42.61, P<.001) compared with winter. Additionally, the significant correlation with delayed M10 onset was observed solely in summer (β of PHQ-8 × summer = 1.06, P=.008). Moreover, compared with winter, participants experienced a shorter sleep duration by 16.6 minutes, an increase in daily steps by 394.5, a delay in M10 onset by 20.5 minutes, and a delay in HR peak time by 67.9 minutes during summer. Our findings highlight significant seasonal influences on human circadian rhythms and their associations with depression, underscoring the importance of considering seasonal variations in mHealth research for real-world applications. This study also indicates the potential of wearable-measured circadian rhythms as digital biomarkers for depression.",['Zhang Y; Folarin AA; Sun S; Cummins N; Ranjan Y; Rashid Z; Stewart C; Conde P; Sankesara H; Laiou P; Matcham F; White KM; Oetzmann C; Lamers F; Siddi S; Simblett S; Vairavan S; Myin-Germeys I; Mohr DC; Wykes T; Haro JM; Annas P; Penninx BW; Narayan VA; Hotopf M; Dobson RJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941600,"study aims to explore the association between depression severity and circadian rhythm features. participants' behaviors, including step count, and heart rate, were tracked via Fitbit devices for up to 2 years."
"The regulatory effects of water probiotic supplementation on the blood physiology, reproductive performance, and its related genes in Red Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus X O. mossambicus).","Probiotics are becoming increasingly popular as eco-friendly alternatives in aquaculture. However, there is limited research on their impacts on the reproductive efficiency of Red Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus x O. mossambicus) broodstock. Therefore, this experiment aimed to explore the combined effects of selective probiotics Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis (BSL; 1:1) added to water on blood hematology, serum metabolites, gonadal histology, reproductive performance, and reproductive associated genes in Red Tilapia broodstock. Tilapia broodfish weighing 140-160 g were stocked in four treatment groups: control (T0), and the other three groups were added different levels of BSL to the water as follows: T1 (0.01 g/m<sup>3</sup>), T2 (0.02 g/m<sup>3</sup>), and T3 (0.03 g/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. Results indicate that BSL administration significantly improved RBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCH, and MCHC, with the highest improvement seen in the T3 group (P < 0.05). BSL added to the fish water significantly enhanced serum protein fractions (total protein, albumin, and globulins), while AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, uric acid, and glucose were significantly diminished in a dose-dependent way (P < 0.05). Adding 0.02-0.03 g/ m<sup>3</sup> of BSL resulted in higher antioxidant status (superoxide dismutase and catalase) compared to other groups (P < 0.05). Testosterone levels were higher in T3 than in other groups (P < 0.05). All female hormones (LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone) were substantially augmented by the addition of BSL. Additionally, the BSL groups exhibited higher GSI, HSI, VSI (male only), egg diameter (mm), mean number of fry/fish, and mean fry weight (g) compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Expression of reproductive-associated genes (vasa, nanos1a, nanos2, dnd1, pum1, AMH, and vtg) were significantly up-regulated in the gonads of fish in the 0.03 g/m<sup>3</sup> treatment. The histological gonadal structure exhibited that BSL improved gonad maturation in both genders of Tilapia fish. Overall, adding a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (0.03 g/m<sup>3</sup> water) can accelerate reproductive performance in Red Tilapia through up-regulation of reproductive genes and enhance the health profile.",['Eissa EH; El-Sayed AM; Hendam BM; Ghanem SF; Abd Elnabi HE; Abd El-Aziz YM; Abdelnour SA; Eissa MEH; Dighiesh HS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39113050,probiotics are becoming increasingly popular as eco-friendly alternatives in aquaculture. but there is limited research on their impacts on the reproductive efficiency of red Tilapia broodstock.

Growing evidence that endometriosis is a systemic disease.,"The pathophysiology of endometriosis remains unclear. Retrograde menstruation could be a phenomenon that initiates the process, but it may not explain the entire pathophysiology of endometriosis. Current evidence suggests that endometriosis is a type of chronic inflammatory disease. Many conditions that affect the vascular endothelium, including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and pre-eclampsia, have been shown to be associated with endometriosis. Evidence to date suggests a complex interaction in endometriosis between angiogenesis, hormones and immunological changes stemming from chronic inflammation, with the inflammatory cells releasing cytokines and chemokines including tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Indeed, TNF-α is considered to be one of the possible markers of endometriosis in the blood, endometrium or menstrual blood. We emphasize the importance of pursuing research for novel and safer anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs that can be used by patients with endometriosis on a long-term basis.",['Tulandi T; Vercellini P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38943810,endometriosis is a type of chronic inflammatory disease. inflammatory cells release cytokines and chemokines including tumour necrosis factor-.
Early versus late follicular phase ovarian stimulation: a randomized controlled trial.,"Is late follicular phase stimulation as efficient as early follicular phase stimulation in a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in oocyte donors in terms of the number of oocytes. In this open label, phase 3, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial using a two-arm design with a 1:1 allocation ratio, 84 oocyte donors were allocated to the early follicular start group (control group, n = 41) or the late follicular start group (study group, n = 43). In the control group, women followed a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol with recombinant FSH (r-FSH) 225 IU. In the study group, r-FSH 225 IU was initiated in the late follicular phase. The primary outcome was the number of oocytes. The secondary outcomes were the number of mature oocytes, consumption of gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonist, and cost of medication. The number of oocytes did not differ between the control group and the study group (intent-to-treat analysis 15.5 ± 11.0 versus 14.0 ± 10.7, P = 0.52; per-protocol analysis 18.2 ± 9.7 versus 18.8 ± 7.8, P = 0.62). In addition, the number of mature oocytes did not differ between the groups (14.1 ± 8.1 versus 12.7 ± 8.5, P = 0.48).

Measuring air metagenomic diversity in an agricultural ecosystem.,"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5 months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.",['Giolai M; Verweij W; Martin S; Pearson N; Nicholson P; Leggett RM; Clark MD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096906,airborne eDNA can be used to measure biodiversity. eDNA can be used to monitor biodiversity. eDNA can be used to identify pathogens.
Understanding REM Sleep Behavior Disorder through Functional MRI: A Systematic Review.,"Neuroimaging studies in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can inform fundamental questions about the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Across modalities, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be better suited to identify changes between neural networks in the earliest stages of Lewy body diseases when structural changes may be subtle or absent. This review synthesizes the findings from all fMRI studies of RBD to gain further insight into the pathophysiology and progression of Lewy body diseases. A total of 32 studies were identified using a systematic review conducted according to PRISMA guidelines between January 2000 to February 2024 for original fMRI studies in patients with either isolated RBD (iRBD) or RBD secondary to PD. Common functional alterations were detectable in iRBD patients compared with healthy controls across brainstem nuclei, basal ganglia, frontal and occipital lobes, and whole brain network measures. Patients with established PD and RBD demonstrated decreased functional connectivity across the whole brain and brainstem nuclei, but increased functional connectivity in the cerebellum and frontal lobe compared with those PD patients without RBD. Finally, longitudinal changes in resting state functional connectivity were found to track with disease progression. Currently, fMRI studies in RBD have demonstrated early signatures of neurodegeneration across both motor and non-motor pathways. Although more work is needed, such findings have the potential to inform our understanding of disease, help to distinguish between prodromal PD and prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies, and support the development of fMRI-based outcome measures of phenoconversion and progression in future disease modifying trials. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice on Menstrual Hygiene Management among School Adolescents.","Menstrual hygiene management remains a taboo in many communities in Nepal. Cultural beliefs about menstruation such as food taboos and untouchability have negative impact on dignity, health and education of adolescent girls. The objective of the study was to assess the current knowledge, attitude and practice of school adolescents on menstrual hygiene management in Doti District in Far-Western Nepal. This cross-sectional study was carried out from October to December 2016 at seven village development committees in Doti district, Nepal. This study was done among 276 students from grade seven and eight of 11 schools. Self-administered structured questionnaire was used to obtain information from school students. Descriptive analysis was done to analyse the knowledge, attitude and practice of school adolescents on menstrual hygiene management. 67.4% respondents had fair knowledge and 26.4% respondents had good knowledge on menstrual hygiene management. However, out of 141 female adolescent respondents, only 56 (40%) were engaged in good menstrual hygiene practices. Around half of the respondents had positive attitude towards menstrual hygiene management related issues. Although knowledge on menstrual hygiene management among school adolescents is fair, still attitude and practice need to improve. Findings indicate the need of behavior change communication campaigns along with frequent reinforcement of school health education programs.",['Yadav RN; Joshi S; Poudel R; Pandeya P'],2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353891,"knowledge, attitude and practice of school adolescents on menstrual hygiene management in doti district, far-Western Nepal. study was carried out among 276 students from grade seven and 8 of 11 schools."
Dienogest reduces endometrioma volume and endometriosis-related pain symptoms.,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of dienogest for the treatment of endometriomas. Dienogest (2 mg/day) was administered to patients with endometrioma continuously through the 6-month study period. The patients were prospectively examined on the efficacy and side effects at baseline, at third months, and sixth months of the treatment. Twenty-four out of 30 patients were able to complete the study. The mean volume of the endometrioma decreased significantly from 112.63 ± 161.31 cm³ at baseline to 65.47 ± 95.69 cm³ at a 6-month follow-up (-41%) (<i>p</i> = .005). The VAS score for pelvic pain decreased significantly from 7.50 to 3.00 (<i>p</i> < .001) at the sixth months of treatment. The most common side effects were menstrual irregularities. Laboratory parameters did not change during the study. Dienogest considered being effective for 6 months of use in decreasing the size of endometrioma, reducing endometriosis-associated pain with a favourable safety and tolerability profile.Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Laparoscopic excisional surgery for endometrioma is currently the most valid approach in the treatment of endometriomas. However, there are concerns about ovarian reserve damage during surgery.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Dienogest considered being effective in decreasing the size of endometrioma, reducing endometriosis-associated pain with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Long-term use of dienogest in younger patients with endometriomas who are yet to give birth may reduce the possibility of surgery by reducing the size of the endometriomas and may preserve ovarian reserve.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Dienogest may reduce the incidence of infectious complications such as pelvic abscess after oocyte retrieval and the surgical procedures in infertile patients with endometrioma.",['Uludag SZ; Demirtas E; Sahin Y; Aygen EM'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629621,dienogest was administered to endometriomas continuously through 6-month study period. the patients were prospectively examined on efficacy and side effects.
Infertility following trisomic pregnancies: A nationwide cohort study.,"To study whether gynecologic or reproductive disorders show association with trisomic conceptions. This nationwide cohort study utilized the Registry of Congenital Malformations to identify women who had a trisomic pregnancy (n = 5784), either with trisomy 13 (T13; n = 351), trisomy 18 (T18; n = 1065) or trisomy 21 (T21; n = 4369) from 1987 to 2018. We used the Finnish Maternity cohort to match the cases to population controls (n = 34 422) on the age, residence, and timing of pregnancy. These data were cross-linked to the ICD-10 diagnoses of the national Care Registry for Health Care data on specialized health care in Finland during 1996 to 2019. Both inflammatory (ICD-10 diagnoses: N70-N77) and noninflammatory disorders of the genital tract (N80-N98) were studied. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated for associations between diagnoses and trisomic conceptions. The diagnosis of female infertility (N97) at any time was associated with trisomic conceptions (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32). In the subgroup analysis, this association was found for T18 (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.61) and T21 (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04-1.32), but not for T13 (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.75-1.72). When restricting the timing of the diagnosis of female infertility, an elevated OR was found only after the index pregnancy (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.56-2.09). These increased odds for infertility after trisomic conceptions were observed both in women <35 years (T18 OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.21-3.00; T21 OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.31-2.14) and in women ≥35 years (T18 OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.40-3.33; T21 OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.47-2.39), but not after T13 conceptions. Our observational data suggest a link between trisomic conceptions and subsequent diagnoses of infertility but do not demonstrate causality. These data implicate that partially similar mechanisms might predispose to trisomy and infertility, regardless of maternal age.",['Wedenoja S; Pihlajamäki M; Gissler M; Wedenoja J; Öhman H; Heinonen S; Kere J; Kääriäinen H; Tanner L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39056516,nationwide cohort study used the Registry of congenital malformations to identify women who had a trisomic pregnancy (n = 5784) both inflammatory (ICD-10 diagnoses: N70-N77) and noninflammatory disorders of the genital tract (N80-N98) were studied.
A Summer Course in Cancer for High School Students - An Update on Lessons Taught and Lessons Learned.,"<b>Background</b> : Previous graduate students and postdoctoral associates from the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, in partnership with the University of Florida Student Science Training Program, implemented a cooperative learning curriculum, providing high school students with a broad overview of cancer topics over six weeks over the summer. However, the ongoing shift in education and training delivery initially necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to many discussions surrounding student autonomy and satisfaction. Furthermore, adapting hybrid and distance learning styles has notably influenced student-led collaboration and critical thinking skills. Here, we report on an update of experiences gleaned from the modified curriculum of this course to accommodate hybrid and cooperative teaching. <b>Methods</b> : This pre-post longitudinal observational study evaluated modifications to a cancer biology and therapeutics course. Student performance was assessed using surveys administered before and after the course to determine effectiveness. <b>Results</b> : Student performance tracked over a 7-year period indicated improved cumulative grade averages after modifying the previous curriculum. Post-assessment analysis revealed significant improvements in student benchmark understanding, notably in their ability to define cancer in one sentence (p = 0.0407), identify cancer therapies (p = 0.0040), and recognize cancer hallmarks (p < 0.0001). An increased trend in median response to the likelihood of pursuing cancer research (p = 0.8793) and the possibility of pursuing cancer research (p = 0.4874) were also observed, although not statistically significant. Moreover, feedback from participating students indicated that ""the educational activities at the end of class (e.g., escape room, case studies)"" and ""learning about cancer and getting to work in groups…"" the curriculum fostered a positive educational learning environment. <b>Conclusion</b> : Students generally held a positive perception of the course. Post-assessment analysis revealed decreasing trends in students' perception of course difficulty compared to their expectations in the pre-assessment. Constructive feedback centered around fostering collaborative environments, with an observed increase in learner autonomy towards the end of the course, as evidenced by students' growing comfort in leading group case studies and conducting research on topics. We hope that future course directors engage actively and incorporate practical clinical examples for students, especially when introducing or discussing complex issues like cancer.",['Solone XK; Chitre S; Font LF; Pereira KNE; Stofer K; Siemann DW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39108485,"previous graduate students and postdoctoral associates implemented a cooperative learning curriculum. this course provides high school students with a broad overview of cancer topics over six weeks over the summer. however, the ongoing shift in education and training delivery initially necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to many discussions surrounding student autonomy and satisfaction."
The top 100 cited articles in menstrual health among adolescent girls: a citation analysis.,"Menstrual health is an important public health concern where it is still considered a taboo, and adolescent girls often lack knowledge about menstrual health, face limited access to sanitation facilities, and struggle with the affordability of sanitary materials. Every year numerous articles are published; however, only a few of them would be influential in the evolution of a particular field. The number of citations received by an article serves as a quality factor for the impact of the article in a particular field. Citation analysis analyses the relationship between citations received by articles. From the literature search, no citation analysis was conducted on menstrual health. Hence the objective of the study was to identify the articles which received hundred or more citations and also to identify the leading countries, journals, study designs, and departments conducting research on menstrual health. Citation analysis was done with search terms pertaining to adolescent and menstrual health using Google Scholar as a database in Publish or Perish software. The articles retrieved were exported to Microsoft Excel. Articles that received a hundred or more citations were screened for the type of article, department, and country where the study was conducted. A descriptive analysis of the hundred or more cited articles was done in Microsoft Excel. A total of 982 articles pertaining to menstrual health among adolescent girls were retrieved. There were hundred articles with hundred and more citations pertaining to the menstrual health of adolescent girls. Cross-sectional study design, Obstetrics and Gynaecology department, India and USA countries, and PLOS ONE journal had the most citations in research on menstrual health among adolescent girls. The top ten articles were on menorrhagia, menstrual hygiene practices, Water, Sanitation and hygiene (WASH), stigma on menstruation, and education on menstrual health.

Variable effect of the post-partum menstrual cycle on aldosterone and renin in women with recent preeclampsia.,"The purpose of the present study is to identify the impact of the postpartum menstrual cycle on aldosterone, renin, and their ratio of women with and without a preeclamptic pregnancy in the past. To this end, we analysed the data from 59 women with a history of preeclampsia and 39 healthy parous controls. Five to seven months post-partum, we measured aldosterone, renin, and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio during both the follicular and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. All measurements were taken in the supine position in the morning. Patients had maintained a standardized sodium diet in the week prior to the measurements. Our results show that in both post-partum women with recent preeclampsia and controls, average levels of renin and aldosterone are significantly elevated in the luteal phase as compared to the follicular phase. The aldosterone-to-renin ratio does not differ between the two phases in either group. Compared to controls, women with recent preeclampsia have significantly lower levels of renin, aldosterone, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio in the follicular phase. This remained consistent in the luteal phase, except for renin. A close correlation existed between the luteal and follicular aldosterone-to-renin ratio in the control group but not in the preeclampsia group. We conclude that both renin and aldosterone are significantly affected by the menstrual cycle whereas the resulting aldosterone-to-renin ratio is not. Post-partum women with recent preeclampsia tend to have lower values for aldosterone and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio than controls.",['Veldhuizen GP; Alnazer RM; Kroon AA; Spaanderman MEA; de Leeuw PW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38898171,the study was carried out by 59 women with a history of preeclampsia. the menstrual cycle was compared to the follicular phase. the menstrual cycle was compared to the follicular phase.
Monoamine oxidases activity maintains endometrial monoamine homeostasis and participates in embryo implantation and development.,"Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) is an enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of monoamines. The current research on this enzyme is focused on its role in neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, MAOs with two isoforms, namely, A and B, are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and are widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Several reports have described periodic changes in the levels of this enzyme in the human endometrial tissue. The novel role of MAOs in endometrial receptivity establishment and embryonic development by maintaining monoamine homeostasis was investigated in this study. MAOs activity was observed to be enhanced during the first trimester in both humans and mice under normal conditions. However, under pathological conditions, MAOs activity was reduced and was linked to early pregnancy failure. During the secretory phase, the endometrial stromal cells differentiated into decidual cells with a stronger metabolism of monoamines by MAOs. Excessive monoamine levels cause monoamine imbalance in decidual cells, which results in the activation of the AKT signal, decreased FOXO1 expression, and decidual dysfunction. The findings suggest that endometrial receptivity depends on the maintenance of monoamine homeostasis via MAOs activity and that this enzyme participates in embryo implantation and development.",['Yu Z; Huang P; Wang L; Meng F; Shi Q; Huang X; Qiu L; Wang H; Kong S; Wu J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39113019,monoamine oxidases (MAOs) is an enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of monoamines. it participates in embryo implantation and development.
Sexual Dimorphism in the Architectural Design of Rat and Human Pelvic Floor Muscles.,"Skeletal muscle architecture is a strong predictor of in vivo functional capacity and is evaluated in fixed tissues, accommodating the study of human muscles from cadaveric donors. Previous studies evaluating the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) demonstrated that the rat is the most appropriate small animal model for the study of female PFM architecture, but the rat's suitability for the study of male PFMs is undetermined. We aimed to determine 1) whether PFM architecture exhibits sexual dimorphism in rats or humans, and 2) if the rat is also a suitable animal model for the study of male human PFMs. PFMs were fixed in situ and harvested en bloc from male and female cadaveric donors and 3-month-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Three architectural parameters influenced by species size were used to compare male vs female PFMs within species, while 4 size-independent measures compared species within sex. All comparisons were made with two-way ANOVAs and Tukey's multiple comparisons tests post hoc. Sarcomere length (rats and humans, p=0.016 and =0.002) and normalized fiber length (rats, p<0.001) were significantly larger in male PFMs. Three of the size-independent measures exhibited similar species trends in both sexes, while the size-independent sarcomere length measure (Ls/Lso) differed between male rats and humans (p<0.001). Thus, sexual dimorphism is present in rat and human PFM architecture and the male rat is suitable for studies of human male PFMs.",['Routzong MR; Rieger MM; Cook MS; Ukkan R; Alperin M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082779,rat is the most appropriate small animal model for the study of female PFMs. rat's suitability for the study of male human PFMs is undetermined.
Evaluating Natural Source Zone Depletion and Enhanced Source Zone Depletion in laboratory columns via soil redox continuous sensing and microbiome characterization.,"To optimally employ Natural Source Zone Depletion (NSZD) and Enhanced Source Zone Depletion (ESZD) at sites impacted by light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL), monitoring strategies are required. Emerging use of subsurface oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) sensors shows promise for tracking redox evolution, which reflects ongoing biogeochemical processes. However, further understanding of how soil redox dynamics relate to subsurface microbial activity and LNAPL degradation pathways is needed. In this work, soil ORP sensors and DNA and RNA sequencing-based microbiome analysis were combined to elucidate NSZD and ESZD (biostimulation via periodic sulfate addition and biosparging) processes in columns containing LNAPL-impacted soils from a former petroleum refinery. Results show expected relationships between continuous soil redox and active microbial communities. Continuous data revealed spatial and temporal detail that informed interpretation of the hydrocarbon biodegradation data. Redox increases were transient for sulfate addition, and sequencing revealed how hydrocarbon concentration and composition impacted microbiome structure and naphthalene degradation. Periodic biosparging did not result in fully aerobic conditions suggesting observed biodegradation improvements could be explained by alternative anaerobic metabolisms (e.g., iron reduction due to air oxidizing reduced iron). Collectively, data suggest combining continuous redox sensing with microbiome analysis provides insights beyond those possible with either monitoring tool alone.",['Irianni-Renno M; Rico JL; Key TA; De Long SK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053064,soil ORP sensors and DNA and RNA sequencing-based microbiome analysis were combined to elucidate NSZD and ESZD. results show expected relationships between continuous soil redox and active microbial communities.
Empathy-related abnormalities among women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder: clinical and functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,"Empathy refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions of an individual to the experiences of another. Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) report severe social difficulties during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. This clinical and functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed to explore affective and cognitive empathy in women with PMDD, during the highly symptomatic luteal phase. Overall, 32 women with PMDD and 20 healthy controls participated in the study. The neuroimaging data were collected using a highly empathy-engaging movie. First, we characterised the synchrony of neural responses within PMDD and healthy groups, using the inter-individual correlation approach. Next, using network cohesion analysis, we compared connectivity within and between brain networks associated with affective and cognitive empathy between groups, and assessed the association of these network patterns with empathic measures. A consistent, although complex, picture of empathy abnormalities was found. Patients with PMDD showed decreased neural synchrony in parietal and frontal key nodes of cognitive empathy processing (theory-of-mind network), but higher neural synchrony in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the salience network, implicated in affective empathy. Positive correlations between cognitive perspective-taking scores and neural synchrony were found within the theory-of-mind network. Interestingly, during highly emotional moments, the PMDD group showed increased functional connectivity within this network. Similar to major depression, individuals with PMDD show enhanced affective empathy and reduced cognitive empathy. These findings echo clinical observations reported when women with PMDD have a dysregulated emotional response to negative stimuli.",['Lerner Y; Raz G; Bloch M; Krasnoshtein M; Tevet M; Hendler T; Tene O'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39101206,women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder report severe social difficulties during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. clinical and functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed to explore affective and cognitive empathy in women with PMDD.
Novel use of a servosphere to study apodous insects: Investigation of blow fly post-feeding larval dispersal.,"Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are arguably the most important providers of an estimate of minimum post-mortem interval in forensic investigations. They usually undergo a post-feeding dispersal from the body. While previous studies have looked at dispersal of groups of larvae, recording the dispersal activity of individual larvae has not previously been demonstrated. A servosphere was used here to record the speed, directionality and phototaxis of individual post-feeding larvae of two species of blow fly on a smooth plastic surface over time. The servosphere rotates to compensate for the movement of an insect placed at its apex, thereby enabling its unimpeded locomotion in any direction to be studied and behavioural changes to external stimuli recorded. To our knowledge, the servosphere has not previously been used to study apodous insects. The objective of our study was to compare dispersal behaviour of Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Protophormia terraenovae (Robineau-Desvoidy), both common primary colonisers of human and animal cadavers, but showing different post-feeding dispersal strategies. Larvae of C. vicina generally disperse from the body while those of P. terraenovae remain on or close to the body. Our aims were to study (1) changes in dispersal speed over a 1-h period; (2) changes in dispersal speed once a day for 4 days, between the end of feeding and onset of pupariation; and (3) response of dispersing larvae to light. We demonstrated that (1) the movement of three C. vicina larvae tracked for 1 continuous hour on 1 day slowed from an average of 3 to <1.7 mms<sup>-1</sup>; (2) the average speed of 20 larvae of C. vicina (4.08 mms<sup>-1</sup>) recorded for 5 min once per day over a 4-day period between onset of dispersal and pupariation was significantly greater than that of P. terraenovae (2.36 mms<sup>-1</sup>; p < 0.0001), but that speed of both species increased slightly over the 4 days; (3) the responses of larvae of C. vicina to changes in light direction from the four cardinal directions of the compass, showed that they exhibited a strong negative phototactic response within 5 s, turning to move at approximately 180° away from the new light position. While conducted to observe larval calliphorid post-feeding behaviour, the results of this proof of concept study show that apodous insects can be studied on a servosphere to produce both qualitative and quantitative data.",['Mactaggart M; Whitaker AP; Wilkinson KN; Hall MJR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044406,"servosphere used to record speed, directionality and phototaxis of larvae. servosphere rotates to compensate for movement of an insect. behavioural changes to external stimuli recorded."
"Menstrual hygiene management and associated factors among adolescent school girls in gursum district, Eastern Ethiopia: Institution-based a cross-sectional study.","In 2017 WHO reported that due to a lack of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) facilities, high costs, and ignorance, 2.3 billion girls and women worldwide do not manage their menstruation properly. This leads to the use of other options, such as old clothes or other unhygienic materials, which may make them a risk group for infections and other health consequences. Despite the significant role of appropriate menstrual hygiene practices, it is still a missed opportunity to address the hygienic practice of menstruation among girls in many low-and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. Primarily, this study was aimed at investigating menstrual hygiene management (MHM) practice and determinant factors among young adolescent school girls in eastern Ethiopia, Gursum District 2021. An institutional-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among adolescent school girls in Gursum, Eastern Ethiopia, in 2021. 577 girls participated in this study and a multi-stage sampling procedure was employed so as to select a fair and representative sample of female students who experienced menarche. After controlling for confounding variables, binary logistic regression was fitted to identify factors affecting MHM among adolescent girls. This study revealed that 58.41% of adolescent school girls practice unsafe MHM practices. It was also reported that 193(33.45%) of the girls use reusable sanitary pads. Of those, 182(31.5%) of them keep the pads in hidden places as it is a shame to be seen Seventy-six (13.17%) of the respondents had experienced vaginal infections during menarche.

"Lack of genetic structure and female-specific effect of dispersal barriers in a rabies vector, the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis).","Evaluating the permeability of potential barriers to movement, dispersal and gene exchanges can help describe spreading patterns of wildlife diseases. Here, we used landscape genetics methods to assess the genetic structure of the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), which is a frequent vector of rabies, a lethal zoonosis of great concern for public health. Our main objective was to identify landscape elements shaping the genetic structure of this species in Southern Québec, Canada, in an area where the raccoon rabies variant has been detected. We hypothesised that geographic distance and landscape barriers, such as highways and major rivers, would modulate genetic structure. We genotyped a total of 289 individuals sampled across a large area (22,000 km²) at nice microsatellite loci. Genetic structure analyses identified a single genetic cluster in the study area. Major rivers and highways, however, influenced the genetic relatedness among sampled individuals. Sex-specific analyses revealed that rivers significantly limited dispersal only for females while highways only had marginal effects. Rivers and highways did not significantly affect male dispersal.

Endometrial Proliferative Phase-Centered View of Transcriptome Dynamics across the Menstrual Cycle.,"The endometrium, the inner mucosal lining of the uterus, undergoes complex molecular and cellular changes across the menstrual cycle in preparation for embryo implantation. Transcriptome-wide analyses have mainly been utilized to study endometrial receptivity, the prerequisite for successful implantation, with most studies, so far, comparing the endometrial transcriptomes between (i) secretory and proliferative endometrium or (ii) mid-secretory and early secretory endometrium. In the current study, we provide a complete transcriptome description of the endometrium across the entire menstrual cycle and, for the first time, comprehensively characterize the proliferative phase of the endometrium. Our temporal transcriptome analysis includes five time points including the mid-proliferative, late proliferative (peri-ovulatory phase), early secretory, mid-secretory, and late secretory phases. Thus, we unveil exhaustively the transitions between the consecutive proliferative and secretory phases, highlighting their unique gene expression profiles and possible distinct biological functions. The transcriptome analysis reveals many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the menstrual cycle, most of which are phase-specific. As an example of coordinated gene activity, the expression profile of histone-encoding genes within the HIST cluster on chromosome 6 shows an increase in cluster activity during the late proliferative and a decline during the mid-secretory phase. Moreover, numerous DEGs are shared among all phases. In conclusion, in the current study, we delineate the endometrial proliferative phase-centered view of transcriptome dynamics across the menstrual cycle. Our data analysis highlights significant transcriptomic and functional changes occurring during the late proliferative phase-an essential transition point from the proliferative phase to the secretory phase. Future studies should explore how the biology of the late proliferative phase endometrium impacts the achievement of mid-secretory endometrial receptivity or contributes to molecular aberrations leading to embryo implantation failure.",['Apostolov A; Naydenov M; Kalinina A; Nikolova M; Saare M; Aleksejeva E; Milova N; Milov A; Salumets A; Baev V; Yahubyan G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38791358,transcriptome analysis reveals many differentially expressed genes across the menstrual cycle. transcriptome analysis reveals many differentially expressed genes across the menstrual cycle.
Predicting the Outcomes of In Vitro Fertilization Using Baseline Maternal Serum Inflammatory Markers: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Achieving pregnancy through in vitro fertilization (IVF) remains a challenge, with less than one-third of women succeeding. There is a pressing need for reliable predictive tools to assess the likelihood of post-IVF pregnancy. While some serum inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated for their predictive potential, substantial knowledge gaps persist. This study examined the utility of different inflammatory markers in predicting IVF outcomes. Inflammatory markers including the white blood cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet count, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> were assessed. Study outcomes were chemical pregnancy (positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin 2 weeks post-embryo transfer), clinical pregnancy (detection of pregnancy sac via transvaginal ultrasonography), and viable pregnancy (detection of fetal heart rate). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted, with multivariate analysis incorporating age, body mass index, infertility duration, type, and etiology, as well as all studied serum inflammatory markers, embryo count, stage, quality, and endometrial thickness. Lower NLR (p < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 0.372 [0.247-0.559]) and CRP (p = 0.035, odds ratio = 0.956 [0.916-0.997]) predicted chemical pregnancy in univariate analysis, with NLR maintaining significance in multivariate analysis (p = 0.022, OR = 0.319 [0.120-0.848]). Lower NLR (p < 0.001, OR = 0.309 [0.198-0.482]) and PLR (p = 0.013, OR = 0.994 [0.990-0.999]) predicted clinical pregnancy, with NLR surviving multivariate analysis (p = 0.005, OR = 0.217 [0.075-0.626]). Lower NLR (p < 0.001, OR = 0.320 [0.198-0.516]) also predicted viable pregnancy, maintaining statistical significance in multivariate analysis (p = 0.002, OR = 0.177 [0.058-0.541]). Other studied inflammatory markers did not predict IVF outcomes.

Socio-ecological influences on access to abortion care in Costa Rica: a qualitative analysis of key perspectives from clinical and policy stakeholders.,"Costa Rica prohibits abortion except under narrow circumstances to save the pregnant person's life. The country boasts historically strong support for social policy and human rights, while also presenting a complex and restrictive abortion access landscape. From September 2021 to March 2022, we conducted 23 interviews with obstetrician-gynecologist (OB/GYN) physicians, OB/GYN medical residents, and policy stakeholders to explore the socio-ecological influences on abortion access in Costa Rica. We sampled clinicians and policy stakeholders from the Universidad de Ciencias Médicas listserv through snowball sampling and conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews in Spanish. We identified limited access to comprehensive sexual health education, lack of support from interpersonal networks, inadequate provider knowledge and training, financial and migratory status, and both provider and community stigma as substantial barriers to abortion access. This study addresses a gap in published research around the social determinants of abortion in Costa Rica and sheds light on the attitudes and opinions of the medical and policy stakeholder communities about abortion access. The results highlight the need for expanded access to comprehensive sexual health education, abortion-related training for healthcare providers, and increased programming efforts, such as funding, outreach, and implementation, to ensure comprehensive reproductive health services are available and accessible, especially for vulnerable populations in Costa Rica.","[""Halper E; Erhardt-Ohren B; Cobb M; Hidalgo-Mora O; Ospina-Henao S; O'Bannon A; Rochat R; Narasimhan S; Newton-Levinson A""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105442,"from 2021 to 2022, we conducted 23 interviews with obstetrician-gynecologist. we identified limited access to comprehensive sexual health education, lack of support from interpersonal networks, inadequate provider knowledge and training, financial and migratory status."
"Monitoring of sprint and change of direction velocity, vertical jump height, and repeated sprint ability in sub-elite female football players throughout their menstrual cycle.","The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the early follicular (EF, i.e., menstruation), late follicular (LF), and middle luteal (ML) phases of the menstrual cycle and different factors that may influence football performance. To this end, 11 eumenorrheic sub-elite female football players underwent field tests to assess sprint speed, lower extremity power, repeated sprint ability, velocity on change of direction, and technical skills at each cycle phase. Performance during the 15-m change of direction ability test, 15-m ball dribbling test, squat jump height, total sprint time [sum of 7 sprints] and decrement score [(mean sprint time/best sprint time × 100) - 100], maximum and mean heart rate, and perceived exertion did not significantly differ among menstrual cycle phases. Conversely, the linear sprint velocity over 10, 20, 30-m distances was decreased in EF <i>vs</i> LF (10-, 20- and 30-m) and in ML vs LF (10- and 20-m) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The 40-m sprint velocity did not change in the different menstrual cycle phases. Overall, our study suggests that sex hormone fluctuations during the menstrual cycle are not associated with vertical jump, velocity on change of direction, and repeated sprint ability, but may influence linear sprint velocity over short distances (10, 20, and 30 m).",['Igonin PH; Cognasse F; Gonzalo P; Philippot P; Rogowski I; Sabot T; Boisseau N; Martin C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38492212,11 eumenorrheic sub-elite female football players underwent field tests. the study was to investigate the associations between the early follicular (EF) and late follicular (LF) phases of the menstrual cycle.
Abortion Stigma as a Barrier to Mifepristone Use among Obstetrician-Gynecologists in Alabama for Early Pregnancy Loss.,"The objective of our study was to identify and characterize barriers to mifepristone use among obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) for early pregnancy loss in a southern US state. In this qualitative study, we conducted semistructured interviews with 19 OB-GYNs in Alabama who manage early pregnancy loss. The interviews explored participants' knowledge of and experience with mifepristone use for miscarriage management and abortion, along with barriers to and facilitators of clinical mifepristone use. The interviews were coded by multiple study staff using inductive and deductive thematic coding. Nearly all of the interviewees identified abortion-related stigma as a barrier to mifepristone use. Interviewees often attributed stigma to a lack of knowledge about the clinical use of mifepristone for early pregnancy loss. The stigmatization of mifepristone due to its association with abortion was related to religious and political objections. Many interviewees also described stigma associated with misoprostol use. Although providers believed that mifepristone use for abortion would not be accepted in their practice, most believed that mifepristone could be used successfully for miscarriage management after practice-wide education on its use. Mifepristone is strongly associated with abortion stigma among OB-GYNs in Alabama, which is a barrier to its use for miscarriage management. Interventions to decrease abortion stigma and associated stigma surrounding mifepristone are needed to optimize early pregnancy loss care.",['Mokashi M; Boulineaux C; Janiak E; Boozer M; Neill S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094802,OB-GYNs in Alabama manage early pregnancy loss. they identified barriers to mifepristone use among OB-Gynecologists. the study was designed to identify and characterize barriers to mifepristone use.
"Implementing menstrual cycle tracking: A pilot concept mapping study investigating considerations of coaches, support staff, and female athletes.","To identify what coaches, support staff, and athletes believe should be considered when implementing menstrual cycle tracking in sport. Concept mapping (mixed-methods participatory approach). Participants brainstormed statements in response to the focus prompt ""What should be considered when tracking menstrual cycles in sport?"" Participants then sorted the statements into groups according to meaning and rated each statement on its importance and feasibility to address. Twenty-six participants (12 athletes and 14 coaches/support staff) generated 53 ideas that the research team synthesised to 57 unique statements. Sixteen participants sorted the statements into an average of 8 (±4) groups. Six clusters were identified as the most appropriate representation of the sorting data following multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis: 1) Ethics, 2) Tracking Tools and Methods, 3) Performance and Health, 4) Education, 5) Interpretation and Framing and 6) Communication.

"Comparative analysis of solar module configuration and tracking systems for enhanced energy generation in South Sakucia Union, Bhola, Bangladesh: A software based analysis.","Bangladesh is blessed with an extensive range of solar energy generation possibilities; however, the primary impediment to attaining its full potential in the solar energy industry is the inadequate budget in the energy sector. As a result, determining the most economical and efficient solar module configuration for each specific scenario has become a critical necessity. This study offers a comprehensive techno-economic analysis and environmental impact assessment of four distinct solar modules: monofacial, bifacial, dual-axis solar tracker, and seasonal tilt solar module, in an open area of South Sakucia Union, Bhola district, in the southwest part of Bangladesh. By integrating energy-generation capabilities, financial metrics, and environmental benefits, this research provides a holistic evaluation framework to ensure optimal economic performance and minimal adverse environmental effects for sustainable solar solutions in Bangladesh. Utilizing PV*SOL, PVsyst, and System Advisor Model (SAM) software, this study assesses energy-generation capabilities and economic viability. Despite the dual-axis solar tracker exhibiting the highest average energy generation (149,070.3 kWh/year), its higher initial cost renders it less financially viable compared to other configurations. Financial metrics reveal that the seasonal tilt configuration is the most cost-efficient, with the lowest Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) at $0.0452/kWh and the highest Net Present Value (NPV) of $52,887.70. Additionally, it has the shortest Discounted Payback Period (DPBP) at 12.69 years, a favorable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.460 %, and a Profitability Index (PI) of 1.459, indicating robust returns on investment. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both energy-generation capabilities and financial metrics when evaluating solar module configurations in the southern part of Bangladesh, serving as a valuable reference for policymakers. Moreover, meticulous environmental impact assessments assist in choosing configurations with minimal adverse effects on the environment.",['Oyshei KR; Hasan KMS; Sadat N; Hoque MA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071609,"study offers a comprehensive techno-economic analysis and environmental impact assessment of four distinct solar modules. monofacial, bifacial, dual-axis solar tracker, and seasonal tilt solar module. the seasonal tilt configuration is the most cost-efficient, with the lowest levelized Cost of Electricity at $0.0452/kWh and the highest Net Present Value (NPV) of $52,887.70."
Higher Depressive Symptoms in Irregular Menstrual Cycles: Converging Evidence from Cross-Sectional and Prospective Assessments.,"Menstrual cycle regularity is an important marker of reproductive health and associated with physiological and psychological illnesses, as well as experiencing stress. We hypothesized that individuals with irregular menstrual cycles report higher depressive symptom severity, after controlling for stress occurrence. The hypothesis was examined through two measurement approaches: a cross-sectional and a prospective, longitudinal study. In the cross-sectional study, participants (n = 394) reported depressive symptoms and their overall menstrual cycle regularity. In the longitudinal study, participants (n = 77) completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms and stress during the mid-follicular and periovulatory phase of one menstrual cycle. Depressive symptoms were compared between participants with regular and irregular cycles through a Welch t test and an ANCOVA. Participants with irregular menstrual cycles reported more depressive symptoms in the cross-sectional analysis. Similarly, in the longitudinal analysis, the group with a current irregular menstrual cycle reported more depressive symptoms after controlling for stress occurrence. When including only complete data sets without multiple imputation (n = 52), the direction of the effects remained but did not reach statistical significance. The results indicate an association between depressive symptoms and menstrual cycle irregularity. Limitations were that although we investigated the menstrual cycle prospectively, it would have been more precise to include two or more cycles and daily sex hormone measurements. Further limitations were the suboptimal statistical power and the data collection during the COVID pandemic. We give recommendations on how to incorporate the association of depressive symptoms and cycle irregularity in future study designs on women's mental health.",['Klusmann H; Kapp C; Engel S; Schumacher T; Bücklein E; Knaevelsrud C; Schumacher S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38194941,menstrual cycle regularity is an important marker of reproductive health. it is associated with physiological and psychological illnesses. a prospective longitudinal study examined the hypothesis.

"Perceptions, Practices, and Challenges Regarding Menstrual Hygiene Among Women in Karachi, Pakistan: A Comparison Between General Population and Healthcare Workers.","Background Menstruation is a natural physiological phenomenon, yet considered a stigmatized subject, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan. It is seldom discussed openly, leading to flow of incorrect and incomplete knowledge. The resultant unhealthy practices not only affect the health of the menstruator but can also contribute to considerable psychosocial stress. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is an important facet, which is associated with a variety of practices and beliefs in different parts of the world, some of which may not be correct. Identifying these poor methods is necessary in order to rectify them. Hence, our study aimed at determining the level of knowledge, beliefs, and practices pertaining to menstruation in the general female populace of Karachi. Healthcare workers have a potential role in the dissemination of authentic knowledge and practices. Therefore, we assessed and compared the accuracy and reliability of the aforementioned parameters in them and the need for an educational intervention. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted on females visiting the Gynecologic and Obstetrics Outpatient Department (OPD), and healthcare workers employed at Dr. Ruth K. M. Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi and Dow University Hospital Ojha. Using non-probability convenience sampling, a self-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 353 respondents over a duration of three months from October 2019 to January 2020. Data was tabulated in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). In accordance with the objectives of the study, descriptive analysis was performed, and data was presented in the form of frequencies and percentages.  Results Of the 353 participants, 176 were from the general population and 177 were healthcare workers. At menarche, only 28.4% of the general population and 29.4% of healthcare workers had an idea of menses and proper placement of absorbent. Significantly lower number of females from the general population were found to be aware of tampons and menstrual cups (15.9% and 11.4% respectively) as compared to healthcare workers. For both groups, the source of knowledge was mostly their mother. The study showed that 77.8% of the general population and 66.1% of healthcare workers avoided bathing on certain days during menses, with the most common reason being that ""it causes irregular flow"". As compared to healthcare workers, a significantly higher number of women from the general population had restrictions of activity (53.4%) and avoided washing of groin area during menstruation (31.2%). Majority of women from the general population mentioned that they were scared when they menstruated for the first time. The most common absorbent used by respondents was pads, followed by cloth. The data showed 64.2% of females from the general population and 28.8% of healthcare workers abstained from eating certain foods. Seeking treatment for gynecological issues was not widespread among respondents. Conclusion Our study demonstrated insufficient menstrual knowledge, and consequent incorrect practices in the female population of Karachi. Destigmatizing menstruation and educating women and young girls is indispensable to overcoming this gap. At the same time, reinforcing the availability of MHM products is long overdue and is a crucial milestone towards facilitation of MHM for the women of Pakistan.",['Arshad Ali S; Baloch M; Riaz L; Iqbal A; Riaz R; Perveen B; Siddiqui M; Arshad Ali A'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32968560,"menstruation is a natural physiological phenomenon, yet considered a stigmatized subject. the resultant unhealthy practices affect the health of the menstruator. a descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted on females visiting the OPD."
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is related to early emotional reactivity: An ERP study.,"Despite the evidence of altered emotion processing in oral contraceptive (OC) users, the impact of hormonal intrauterine devices (IUD) on emotional processing remains unexplored. Our study aimed to investigate how behavioural performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) linked with emotion reactivity and its regulation are associated with hormonal profiles of women using different types of hormonal contraception and naturally cycling women. Women using OCs (n = 25), hormonal IUDs (n = 33), and naturally cycling women in their early follicular (NCF, n = 33) or mid-luteal (NCL, n = 28) phase of the menstrual cycle were instructed to view emotional pictures (neutral, low and high negativity) and use cognitive reappraisal to up- or down-regulate negative emotions, while their electroencephalogram was recorded. Participants rated perceived negativity after each picture and their emotional arousal throughout the task. Saliva samples were collected to assess levels of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. As expected, emotional arousal increased throughout the task and correlated positively with perceived negativity. Perceived negativity and the amplitudes of the middle (N2/P3) and later (LPP) latency ERP components increased with increasing stimuli negativity. Emotion regulation modulated perceived negativity and the amplitudes of very late ERP components (parietal and frontal LPP). Moreover, IUD-users showed a higher negative amplitude of the frontal N2 in comparison to all three other groups, with the most consistent differences during up-regulation. Finally, testosterone correlated positively with the N2 peak in IUD-users and NCL women. Overall, our findings suggest that IUD-use and testosterone might be related to altered preconscious processing during the emotion regulation task requiring attention to the stimulus. The study underscores the need for additional research into how different hormonal contraceptives are linked to socio-emotional functioning.",['Zelionkaitė I; Gaižauskaitė R; Uusberg H; Uusberg A; Ambrasė A; Derntl B; Grikšienė R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38241970,hormonal intrauterine devices (IUD) are linked to early emotional reactivity. the impact of hormonal intrauterine devices on emotional processing remains unexplored.
Significant increase of emergency hernia operation during COVID.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgeries including hernia repairs, were postponed, or cancelled completely. However, it has been stated previously that the volume of surgical emergency hernia repairs did not drop during this period. Due to the disruption in elective surgeries, waiting lists have increased rapidly, causing a suspected treatment delay. To gain improved insight in preoperative patient prioritization, the aim of this multicenter study was to track volumes of hernia surgery before, during and after the pandemic to investigate for a shift from elective towards emergency hernia surgery. A retrospective study using hernia databases from four regional hospitals to account for altered referral patterns (elective versus emergent), capturing patients' admissions and surgery times for both groin and ventral hernia repair was conducted. Study period was predefined from March 2019 to March 2023. Data are presented as descriptive statistics. During the historic period, 106 of 2267 hernia surgeries (4.7%) performed were defined as emergency repairs. During the pandemic, 3864 elective surgeries were executed, of which 213(5.5%) emergencies. During the current period, the portion of emergencies dropped to 4.9% (110 emergency hernia repairs); (p = 0.039). A non-significant increase in emergent incisional hernia repair during the pandemic period was found chronologically 9.9%, 11.8% and 11.6% emergent repairs(p = 0.75). There were no statistically significant differences across the hernia types in elective versus urgent rate.

In need of robust evidence of non-association of pregestational and early pregnancy SARS-CoV-2 infections with congenital anomalies.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregestational and early pregnancy periods has an unclear impact on fetal development. Although vertical transmission is rare, potential effects on the developing fetal brain are plausible. However, robust evidence linking maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection to congenital anomalies is limited due to inadequate tracking of infection history and methodological flaws in published studies. This is further complicated by limitations, such as restricted testing access and undiagnosed infections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Most data focus on hospitalized women near term, lacking information on first- and second-trimester infections. Thus, an accurate assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on congenital anomalies is essential. It should however be emphasised that we have robust evidence that vaccination against COVID-19 before or during early pregnancy is not associated with malformations, ruling out any role of COVID-19 vaccines in these increased rates of congenital abnormalities. This viewpoint discusses findings from surveillance registries, highlights study limitations, and offers research recommendations to inform clinical guidelines and public health strategies, aiming to mitigate the effects of viral infections on early neurodevelopment.",['Samara A; Souter V; Coutinho CM; Khalil A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39109188,a lack of evidence linking maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection to congenital anomalies is essential. it is difficult to find evidence linking maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection to congenital anomalies.
saline-infused sonohysterography: tips for achieving greater success.,"Saline-infused sonohysterography (SIS) may help improve visualization of the endometrium and endometrial cavity and assess tubal patency. Although most SIS procedures are straightforward, a variety of pitfalls may lead to an unsuccessful procedure or incomplete evaluation. SIS should be scheduled between days 4 and 10 of the patient's menstrual cycle, when the endometrium is at its thinnest, and physiologic changes during the secretory phase are not present. Performing preprocedure imaging serves many purposes, such as depicting hydrosalpinx, causes of uterine and adnexal tenderness, and pelvic inflammatory disease, as well as assessing the size and position of the uterus and the orientation of the cervix. It is important not to presume that fibroids are the cause of bleeding when the endometrium is obscured at preprocedure imaging. Obstacles to a successful procedure include issues related to patient anxiety and discomfort, which may be prevented or minimized at almost every step of the procedure. Inability to obtain access to the cervix is the most common cause of unsuccessful SIS; proper patient positioning in a semi-upright lithotomy position is important. Injection of air during any US-guided procedure may lead to shadowing that obscures the region of interest. Adequate distention of the endometrial cavity is crucial for successful SIS, and optimal positioning of the distended balloon may improve the degree of distention. However, poor distention may be indicative of an underlying pathologic condition. Knowledge of these pitfalls and the strategies to overcome them may prevent premature or unnecessary termination of an otherwise successful study.",['Allison SJ; Horrow MM; Kim HY; Lev-Toaff AS'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22084183,saline-infused sonohysterography may help improve visualization of endometrium and endometrial cavity. a variety of pitfalls may lead to unsuccessful procedure or incomplete evaluation. a successful procedure should be scheduled between days 4 and 10 of the patient's menstrual cycle.
"Application of circular statistics in temporal distribution of adult mosquitoes in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, 2021-2023.","Analyses of the temporal distribution of mosquitoes are presented in statistical charts, but it is difficult to prove in statistics whether differences in peak periods exist among different years or habitats. This study aimed to investigate the application of circular statistics in determining the peak period and a comparison of differences. Surveillance of adult mosquitoes was conducted twice a month by light traps in five different habitats from March to November for 3 years (2021-2023) in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine the differences in mosquito density among different years and habitats. Circular statistics and line charts were employed to determine the peak period and a comparison of differences. Among a total of 14,834 adult mosquitoes comprising five mosquito species from four genera, Culex pipiens pallens was dominant and accounted for 89.6% of the specimens identified. Aedes albopictus, Armigeres subalbatus, and Anopheles sinensis made up 5.7%, 4.2%, and 0.5%, respectively. Culex tritaeniorhynchus accounted for less than 0.1%. The mean mosquito density (females/trap night) for the trapping period was 10.3 in 2021, 5.6 in 2022, and 3.6 in 2023. Among five habitats, the highest mosquito density was 8.9 in livestock sheds, followed by 6.8 in parks, 5.9 in rural dwellings, 5.5 in urban dwellings, and 5.4 in hospitals. No statistically significant differences were found among different years (H = 1.96, d.f. 2, P = 0.376) and habitats (H = 0.45, d.f. 4, P = 0.978). Overall, the peak period of mosquito activity fell in the months from June to September. The peak period among 3 years differed significantly (F<sub>(2,7022)</sub> = 119.17, P < 0.01), but there were no statistically significant differences in peak period among different habitats (F<sub>(4,7020)</sub> = -159.09, P > 0.05).

Evaluation of real-time fluorescence sensors and benchtop fluorescence for tracking and predicting sewage contamination in the Tijuana River Estuary at the US-Mexico border.,"Cross-border flow of untreated sewage from Mexico into the USA via the Tijuana River is public health issue with negative consequences for coastal communities. Here we evaluate the potential application of fluorescence-based, submersible tryptophan-like (TRP) and humic-like (CDOM) fluorescence sensors for real-time tracking of wastewater pollution in an estuarine environment. Sonde fluorescence measurements were compared with benchtop fluorescence, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations, and real-time specific conductivity measurements in the Tijuana River Estuary during dry and wet weather conditions, and with and without cross-border flow. TRP and CDOM fluorescence concentrations were low during times without cross-border flow and two-three orders of magnitude higher during storm events and after cross-border sewage flow events. Major deterioration in water quality, including hypoxic conditions, was observed after consistent, long-term cross-border sewage flow. Real-time TRP and CDOM fluorescence concentrations had a significant linear relationship with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations during dry weather periods with cross-border flow (p < 0.001) but were poorly correlated during stormflow and during less polluted periods with no cross-border flow. TRP and CDOM fluorescence acquired on discrete samples using a benchtop fluorometer correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with FIB concentrations under all cross-border flow conditions. Based on these relationships, the greatest amount of untreated wastewater in the estuary's surface layer during cross-border flow events was estimated at >80 % and occurred during neap tides, when concentrated, sewage-laden freshwater flowed over dense saline seawater due to stratification and lack of mixing in the estuary. These results are important because exposure to untreated sewage poses severe health risks for residents and visitors to adjacent coastal areas. While benchtop fluorescence was more effective for estimating the degree of wastewater pollution, submersible TRP and CDOM sensors provided a real-time alert of sewage contamination, which can be utilized in other sewage impacted estuarine environments.",['Mladenov N; Biggs T; Ford K; Garcia S; Yuan Y; Grant A; Piazza E; Rivera E; Pinongcos F; Keely SP; Summerlin C; Liden D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094642,cross-border flow of untreated sewage from Mexico into the us is public health issue. sewage contamination in the Tijuana River is public health issue with negative consequences for coastal communities.
Exploring Pelvic Symptom Dynamics in Relation to the Menstrual Cycle: Implications for Clinical Assessment and Management.,"Pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) encompass an array of conditions with discrepant classification systems, hampering accurate prevalence estimation. Despite potentially affecting up to 25% of women during their lifetime, many remain undiagnosed, underestimating the true extent. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the impacts of the menstrual cycle on PFDs and dysfunctions. Secondary objectives included investigating differences between athletic and nonathletic women. An online questionnaire examined the effects of the menstrual cycle (MC) on 477 women's pelvic symptoms (aged 16-63 years), stratified by athletic status. This ad hoc instrument built upon a validated screening tool for female athletes. Most participants reported symptom fluctuations across menstrual phases, with many modifying or reducing exercise participation. A concerning number experienced daily undiagnosed pelvic floor symptoms, emphasizing needs for comprehensive medical evaluation. Exacerbated pelvic symptoms showed complex relationships with menstruation, highlighting the importance of considering the MC in customized clinical management approaches. Symptoms demonstrated differential links to menstruation, indicating needs for individualized evaluation and tailored treatment plans based on symptom profiles and hormonal interactions. Educating professionals and patients remains essential to enhancing awareness, detection, and therapeutic outcomes. Further controlled longitudinal research should elucidate intricate relationships between menstrual cycles and pelvic symptom variability.",['Blanco-Diaz M; Vielva-Gomez A; Legasa-Susperregui M; Perez-Dominguez B; Medrano-Sánchez EM; Diaz-Mohedo E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38540981,"study aimed to examine the impacts of the menstrual cycle on PFDs and dysfunctions. despite potentially affecting up to 25% of women during their lifetime, many remain undiagnosed, underestimating the true extent."
Low-dose aspirin in reproductive health: effects on menstrual cycle characteristics.,"To estimate the effect of daily 81 mg low-dose aspirin (LDA) on menstrual cycle length and hormone profiles. Secondary analysis of a trial evaluating the effect of daily LDA or placebo on live birth among women with one or two previous pregnancy losses. University medical centers. A total of 915 regularly menstruating women who had at least one menstrual cycle (3,190 total cycles) in which pregnancy did not occur. Randomized allocation to LDA versus placebo. Menstrual cycle length and follicular and luteal phases were measured. Urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estrone-3-glucuronide were assessed up to six times during the first two cycles. Generalized estimating equations estimated relative risk of short (<25th percentile: <27 days) and long (>75th percentile: ≥32 days) versus normal cycle length. Linear mixed models estimated mean hormone level differences with weights used to account for multiple cycles contributed per participant. There were no significant differences in total menstrual cycle, follicular phase, or luteal phase length between LDA and placebo groups. LDA posed no greater risk of having a short versus normal-length or long versus normal-length follicular phase, or having a short versus normal-length or long versus normal-length luteal phase. There were no significant differences in hormone levels across the menstrual cycle between the LDA and placebo groups. Daily LDA use did not result in any changes to menstrual cycle, follicular phase, or luteal phase length or hormone levels across the menstrual cycle compared with placebo.

PROGnostic RolE of strain measurements in stress cardiac MRI in predicting major adverse cardiac events.,"We aimed to investigate the role of feature-tracking (FT) strain in long-term risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole; to determine if contrast-free stress cardiac MRI with strain measurements could provide comparable prognostic value to myocardial perfusion. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with stable symptoms suggesting possible cardiac ischemia who underwent stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole. The mean follow-up period was 5.8 years ±1.2 [SD]. FT cardiac MRI analysis was performed for each patient to obtain 2D global peak circumferential strain (GCS). The primary outcome measure was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death. A total of 729 patients (mean age, 63 years ±10 [SD]; 616 males) were included. MACE occurred in 70 (9.6%) patients. The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) ([HR] 2.74, [95% CI: 1.53, 4.88]; P < .001) and stress GCS (HR, 1.06 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.12]; P = .016) were independently associated with MACE. A model based on contrast-free assessment of LVEF and stress GCS showed similar performance for predicting MACE than LVEF and perfusion (P = .056). In patients with known or suspected CAD undergoing stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole, GCS and LGE presence were independent predictors of MACE. Contrast-free stress cardiac MRI with stress GCS measurement offered prognostic value akin to myocardial perfusion assessment. Stress global circumferential strain represented an additional method to predict major adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing stress cardiac MRI, even without the use of contrast agents. This would be of particular significance in patients with severe renal impairment.",['Guglielmo M; Fusini L; Baessato F; Baggiano A; Mushtaq S; Annoni A; Carerj ML; Cilia F; Fazzari F; Formenti A; Gripari P; Mancini ME; Marchetti F; Penso M; Volpe A; Tassetti L; Guaricci AI; Muscogiuri G; Costantini P; van der Bilt I; van der Harst P; Rabbat MG; Rossi A; Fontana M; Pontone G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38964552,strain measurements in stress cardiac MRI were performed for each patient.

"Women at Altitude: Menstrual-Cycle Phase, Menopause, and Exogenous Progesterone Are Not Associated with Acute Mountain Sickness.","Gardner, Laurel, Linda E. Keyes, Caleb Phillips, Elan Small, Tejaswi Adhikari, Nathan Barott, Ken Zafren, Rony Maharjan, and James Marvel. Women at altitude: Menstrual-cycle phase, menopause, and exogenous progesterone are not associated with acute mountain sickness. <i>High Alt Med Biol.</i> 00:000-000, 2024. <b><i>Background:</i></b> Elevated progesterone levels in women may protect against acute mountain sickness (AMS). The impact of hormonal contraception (HC) on AMS is unknown. We examined the effect of natural and exogenous progesterone on the occurrence of AMS. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We conducted a prospective observational convenience study of female trekkers in Lobuche (4,940 m) and Manang (3,519 m). We collected data on last menstrual period, use of exogenous hormones, and development of AMS. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 1,161 trekkers who met inclusion criteria, of whom 307 (26%) had AMS. There was no significant difference in occurrence of AMS between women in the follicular (28%) and the luteal (25%) phases of menstruation (<i>p</i> = 0.48). The proportion of premenopausal (25%) versus postmenopausal women (30%) with AMS did not differ (<i>p</i> = 0.33). The use of HC did not influence the occurrence of AMS (HC 23% vs. no HC 26%, <i>p</i> = 0.47), nor did hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) (HRT 11% vs. no HRT 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.13). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We found no relationship between menstrual-cycle phase, menopausal status, or use of exogenous progesterone and the occurrence of AMS in trekkers and conclude that hormonal status is not a risk factor for AMS. Furthermore, women should not be excluded from future AMS studies based on hormonal status.",['Gardner L; Keyes LE; Phillips C; Small E; Adhikari T; Barott N; Zafren K; Maharjan R; Marvel J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38516987,"women at altitude: menstrual-cycle phase, menopause, and exogenous progesterone are not associated with acute mountain sickness. a prospective study of 1,161 trekkers in manang and luthern, california."

"Endometriosis: Classification, pathophysiology, and treatment options.","The human endometrium is a complex hormone-target tissue consisting of two layers: the lower basalis, and the upper functionalis. The latter of the two goes through a cycle of thickening and shedding without residual scarring or loss of function. This cycle, known as the menstrual cycle, occurs on a monthly basis in most of healthy reproductive-age women. It is, however, associated with a number of reproductive diseases, endometriosis being one of them. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrium at ectopic sites within the peritoneum or, more rarely, other locations outside the abdominal area. It affects around 6-10% of reproductive-age women in the world and causes debilitating pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, pain during penetrative sex, and infertility. The etiology of the disease is not yet fully understood but the generally accepted theory is that the endometriotic lesions originate from viable eutopic endometrial cells that flow back into the peritoneum through the process of retrograde menstruation. Endometriosis is usually classified into four stages: minimal, mild, moderate, and severe, though it is important to note that the presentation of symptoms does not necessarily correspond to the disease progression. The immune system plays an important role in supporting the viability and growth of ectopic endometriotic tissue, all the while promoting chronic inflammation at the lesion sites, which causes prolonged pain. There is no definitive cure for endometriosis, but there are several options for symptom management, including laparoscopy, hormonal therapy, the use of NSAIDs, dietary changes, exercise, and, in cases when all conservative treatments fail, hysterectomy.",['Pašalić E; Tambuwala MM; Hromić-Jahjefendić A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37844487,"endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrium at ectopic sites within the peritoneum or, more rarely, other locations outside the abdominal area. it affects around 6-10% of reproductive-age women in the world and causes debilitating pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, pain during penetrative sex, and infertility."
Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain.,"Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, and mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17β-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (μFA; 17β-estradiol: β<sub>1</sub> = 0.145, highest density interval (HDI) = [0.211, 0.4]; LH: β<sub>1</sub> = 0.111, HDI = [0.157, 0.364]), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to CT (β<sub>1</sub> = 0 .162, HDI = [0.115, 0.678]). Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing relationships with mean diffusivity (D<sub>iso</sub>) and CT. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Finally, progesterone was associated with increased tissue (β<sub>1</sub> = 0.66, HDI = [0.607, 15.845]) and decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; β<sub>1</sub> = -0.749, HDI = [-11.604, -0.903]) volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and CT coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Effects were observed in both classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions (medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex) and in other regions located across frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. Our results suggest that HPG-axis hormone fluctuations may have significant structural impacts across the entire brain.",['Rizor EJ; Babenko V; Dundon NM; Beverly-Aylwin R; Stump A; Hayes M; Herschenfeld-Catalan L; Jacobs EG; Grafton ST'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39031470,a study of 30 naturally cycling women used multidimensional diffusion and Tsub>1/sub>-weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases. a study of 30 naturally cycling women found that the luteinizing hormone concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy.
Systematic review of the effectiveness of menstrual health interventions in low- and middle-income countries in the East Asia and Pacific region.,"In the context of rapidly expanding policy and practice, this systematic review collates and appraises evidence for the effectiveness of menstrual health interventions in the East Asia and Pacific region. Structured searches were undertaken in 7 databases and Google Scholar. Grey literature was identified through searching and survey of stakeholders. Quantitative evaluations were eligible. We audited the interventions and outcomes assessed in current evidence, undertook risk of bias assessment, and narrative synthesis of findings. The review protocol was registered prior to searching (PROSPERO: 343613). Eighteen studies were eligible; categorised according to the requirements for menstrual health they addressed. Information and education intervention studies (n = 11) found school-based programs improved menstrual knowledge test scores but did not evaluate impacts on broader outcomes. Evaluations of interventions providing materials, facilities, and services for menstruation (n = 4) focused on product acceptability. Studies exhibited a serious risk of bias without adequate controls, limitations in intervention allocation, adherence, and participant retention. Six studies of interventions to improve care for menstrual discomforts found decreased self-reported pain but had serious bias without placebo controls. Two interventions targeted the supportive social environment for menstruation. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of menstrual health interventions in the East Asia and Pacific region. Future research must improve reporting, provide clear intervention theory of change, and improve measurement of core concepts.

The Prevalence and Educational Impact of Pelvic and Menstrual Pain in Australia: A National Online Survey of 4202 Young Women Aged 13-25 Years.,"To explore the prevalence and impact of dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms on young women at school or in tertiary education. Cross-sectional online survey in Australia. A total of 4202 adolescent and young women (13-25 years of age; median age 17 years), having reached menarche, living in Australia and currently attending school (n = 2421) or tertiary education (n = 1781). Online survey hosted by Qualtrics between November 2017 to January 2018. Data were collected on sociodemographic data, menstrual cycle characteristics, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and educational and social impact. Information on menstrual and pelvic pain impact, academic absenteeism and presenteeism, impact on non-academic activities and interactions with teaching staff. Dysmenorrhea was reported by 92% of respondents. Dysmenorrhea was moderate (median 6.0 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale) and pain severity stayed relatively constant with age [r<sub>s</sub>(3804) = 0.012, P = .477]. Noncyclical pelvic pain at least once a month was reported by 55%. Both absenteeism and presenteeism related to menstruation were common. Just under half of women reported missing at least one class/lecture in the previous three menstrual cycles. The majority of young women at school (77%) and in tertiary education (70%) reported problems with classroom concentration during menstruation. Higher menstrual pain scores were strongly correlated with increased absenteeism and reduced classroom performance at both school and in tertiary education. Despite the negative impact on academic performance the majority of young women at school (60%) or tertiary education (83%) would not speak to teaching staff about menstruation.",['Armour M; Ferfolja T; Curry C; Hyman MS; Parry K; Chalmers KJ; Smith CA; MacMillan F; Holmes K'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32544516,"online survey of 4202 young women aged 13-25 years. study focuses on the prevalence and impact of dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms."
Perimenopausal women's voices: How does their period at the end of reproductive life affect wellbeing?,"To explore perimenopausal women's feelings towards their periods, the impact on their wellbeing and how we can support them. Participants were recruited for focus groups through social media advertisements. In 6 online focus groups, 31 perimenopausal women aged 40-55 living in the UK were asked 5 questions relating to periods and perimenopause, support and education. Content analysis. When asked How do you feel about having a period? The participants often related back to the stress of menarche and said their period negatively impacted their wellbeing their whole lives. During perimenopause, their periods had become unpredictable, heavy, and a debilitating disruption to their lives. The women desired support at work through policy, and from family and friends. They believed that educating girls and boys during school was the best place to start, but that education through work and community groups was also needed. They felt healthcare professionals should have mandatory training regarding women's health issues and menopause. The study highlights the impact of menstrual experiences on the wellbeing of perimenopausal women, emphasising the need for improved menstrual education from an early age. Comprehensive menstrual education in schools involving both genders to enable informed decision-making and improved training for healthcare professionals are recommended.

Evaluation of family planning methods in married women with epilepsy.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic unit diseases that have different prevalence in different parts of the world. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with major fertility risks for women of childbearing age. Due to the fact that studies on family planning methods in married women with epilepsy (WWE) have not been conducted in Iran, the aim of this study was to evaluate the family planning methods in married WWE in Birjand, Iran. An analytical-descriptive study was performed on 126 married WWE hospitalized in the neurology ward or referred to Vali-e-Asr specialized and sub-specialized clinic in Birjand. Demographic information of patients as well as data on the type of used AED, and various methods of family planning were collected in a questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using Chi-square and Fisher tests. All of the above analyses were considered at a significance level of less than 5% by SPSS v.19 software. The mean age of the patients was 33.41 ± 9.15 years. The mean age of experiencing the first seizure and the onset of menstruation were 24.82 and 13.79 years, respectively. Fifty (35.5%), 38 (27%), 15 (10.6%), 14 (9.9%), and 14 (9.9%) patients used sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine, respectively. The results showed that 72 sexually active patients (70.6%) used family planning methods, of which 43 patients (59.7%) used withdrawal method, 20 patients (27.8%) used condoms, and 6 patients (8.3%) used oral contraceptive pills (OCP). Eight patients (9.6%) had a history of unintended pregnancy and 3 patients (3.6%) had a history of abortion. It is recommended to apply effective family planning methods in married WWE to prevent unintended pregnancies and the subsequent adverse effects in the fetus, considering the fact that a significant percentage of WWE did not use effective family planning methods and 8 cases of unintended pregnancies were reported. Because of high consumption of valproate in women of childbearing age in our study and concerning issue about its fetal malformation, it is recommended to reduce the administration of valproate in this population. Moreover, regarding the low consumption of folic acid, especially for women of childbearing age and pregnant WWE who are taking AED, the necessary recommendations should be made by our physicians.",['Ershadi F; Mousavi Mirzaei SM; Tabrizi N; Roshanravan B; Sahebnasagh A; Avan R'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35257991,study was performed on 126 married WWE hospitalized in the neurology ward. a questionnaire was performed using a questionnaire. the mean age of the patients was 33.41  9.15 years.
Icariin alleviates cisplatin-induced premature ovarian failure by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway.,"Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that can induce ovarian damage. Icariin (ICA), a natural antioxidant derived from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim., has been found to protect against organ injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ICA can exert an ovarian-protective effect on cisplatin induced premature ovarian failure (POF) and the underlying mechanism involved. The preventive effect of ICA was evaluated using body weight, the oestrous cycle, ovarian histological analysis, and follicle counting. ICA treatment increased body weight, ovarian weight, and the number of follicles and improved the oestrous cycle in POF mice. ICA reduced cisplatin-induced oxidative damage and upregulated the protein expression levels of Nrf2, GPX4 and HO-1. Moreover, ICA reduced the expression levels of Bax and γH2AX and inhibited ovarian apoptosis. In addition, ICA activated the Nrf2 pathway in vitro and reversed changes in the viability of cisplatin-induced KGN cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis, and these effects were abrogated when Nrf2 was knocked down or inhibited. Molecular docking confirmed that ICA promotes the release of Nrf2 by competing with Nrf2 for binding to Keap1. The inhibitory effects of ICA on cisplatin-induced oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and apoptosis may be mediated by its modulatory effects on the Nrf2 pathway, providing a novel perspective on the potential mechanisms by which ICA prevents POF.",['Li F; Zhu F; Wang S; Hu H; Zhang D; He Z; Chen J; Li X; Cheng L; Zhong F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068256,cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that can induce ovarian damage.

Oral dydrogesterone versus micronized vaginal progesterone for luteal phase support: a double-blind crossover study investigating pharmacokinetics and impact on the endometrium.,"How do plasma progesterone (P) and dydrogesterone (D) concentrations together with endometrial histology, transcriptomic signatures, and immune cell composition differ when oral dydrogesterone (O-DYD) or micronized vaginal progesterone (MVP) is used for luteal phase support (LPS)? Although after O-DYD intake, even at steady-state, plasma D and 20αdihydrodydrogesterone (DHD) concentrations spiked in comparison to P concentrations, a similar endometrial signature was observed by histological and transcriptomic analysis of the endometrium. O-DYD for LPS has been proven to be noninferior compared to MVP in two phase III randomized controlled trials. Additionally, a combined individual participant data and aggregate data meta-analysis indicated that a higher pregnancy rate and live birth rate may be obtained in women receiving O-DYD versus MVP for LPS in fresh IVF/ICSI cycles. Little data are available on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of O-DYD versus MVP and their potential molecular differences at the level of the reproductive organs, particularly at the endometrial level. Thirty oocyte donors were planned to undergo two ovarian stimulation (OS) cycles with dual triggering (1.000 IU hCG + 0.2 mg triptorelin), each followed by 1 week of LPS: O-DYD or MVP, in a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, double-dummy fashion. On both the first and eighth days of LPS, serial blood samples upon first dosing were harvested for plasma D, DHD, and P concentration analyses. On Day 8 of LPS, an endometrial biopsy was collected for histologic examination, transcriptomics, and immune cell analysis. All oocyte donors were <35 years old, had regular menstrual cycles, no intrauterine contraceptive device, anti-Müllerian hormone within normal range and a BMI ≤29 kg/m2. OS was performed on a GnRH antagonist protocol followed by dual triggering (1.000 IU hCG + 0.2 mg triptorelin) as soon as ≥3 follicles of 20 mm were present. Following oocyte retrieval, subjects initiated LPS consisting of MVP 200 mg or O-DYD 10 mg, both three times daily. D, DHD, and P plasma levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Histological assessment was carried out using the Noyes criteria. Endometrial RNA-sequencing was performed for individual biopsies and differential gene expression was analyzed. Endometrial single-cell suspensions were created followed by flow cytometry for immune cell typing. A total of 21 women completed the entire study protocol. Subjects and stimulation characteristics were found to be similar between groups. Following the first dose of O-DYD, the average observed maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) for D and DHD were 2.9 and 77 ng/ml, respectively. The Cmax for D and DHD was reached after 1.5 and 1.6 h (=Tmax), respectively. On the eighth day of LPS, the first administration of that day gave rise to a Cmax of 3.6 and 88 ng/ml for D and DHD, respectively. For both, the observed Tmax was 1.5 h. Following the first dose of MVP, the Cmax for P was 16 ng/ml with a Tmax of 4.2 h. On the eighth day of LPS, the first administration of that day showed a Cmax for P of 21 ng/ml with a Tmax of 7.3 h. All 42 biopsies showed endometrium in the secretory phase. The mean cycle day was 23.9 (±1.2) in the O-DYD group versus 24.0 (±1.3) in the MVP group. RNA-sequencing did not reveal significantly differentially expressed genes between samples of both study groups. The average Euclidean distance between samples following O-DYD was significantly lower than following MVP (respectively 12.1 versus 18.8, Mann-Whitney P = 6.98e-14). Immune cell profiling showed a decrease of CD3 T-cell, γδ T-cell, and B-cell frequencies after MVP treatment compared to O-DYD, while the frequency of natural killer (NK) cells was significantly increased. The main reason for caution is the small sample size, given the basic research nature of the project. The plasma concentrations are best estimates as this was not a formal PK study. Whole tissue bulk RNA-sequencing has been performed not correcting for bias caused by different tissue compositions across biopsies. This is the first study comparing O-DYD/MVP, head-to-head, in a randomized design on a molecular level in IVF/ICSI. Plasma serum concentrations suggest that administration frequency is important, in addition to dose, specifically for O-DYD showing a rapid clearance. The molecular endometrial data are overall comparable and thus support the previously reported noninferior reproductive outcomes for O-DYD as compared to MVP. Further research is needed to explore the smaller intersample distance following O-DYD and the subtle changes detected in endometrial immune cells.

Women`s sexual function during the postpartum period: A systematic review on measurement tools.,"Sexual health is a critical component of overall well-being, yet discussions around sexual function, especially in the context of postpartum recovery, are often taboo or sidelined. The aim was to review measurement tools assessing women's sexual function/health during the postpartum period. We did a systematic search according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 2020 guidelines in different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Open Access Thesis and Dissertations, and Google scholar search engine until June 2023. Also, the reference list of the related reviews has been screened. Eligible studies included observational studies or clinical trials that evaluated women`s sexual function during the postpartum period using existing tools. Data extraction covered study characteristics, measurement tools, and their validity and reliability. From 3064 retrieved records, after removing duplicates and excluding ineligible studies, and reviewing the reference list of the related reviews, 41 studies were included in this review. Tools measuring sexual function were developed from 1996 to 2017. Sexual activity questionnaire, female sexual function index (FSFI), sexual function questionnaire, short form of the pelvic organ prolapse/urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire, sexual health outcomes in women questionnaire, shorter version of FSFI, and sexual function questionnaire's medical impact scale and Carol scale.

The Accuracy of Wrist Skin Temperature in Detecting Ovulation Compared to Basal Body Temperature: Prospective Comparative Diagnostic Accuracy Study.,"As a daily point measurement, basal body temperature (BBT) might not be able to capture the temperature shift in the menstrual cycle because a single temperature measurement is present on the sliding scale of the circadian rhythm. Wrist skin temperature measured continuously during sleep has the potential to overcome this limitation. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of these two temperatures for detecting ovulation and to investigate the correlation and agreement between these two temperatures in describing thermal changes in menstrual cycles. This prospective study included 193 cycles (170 ovulatory and 23 anovulatory) collected from 57 healthy women. Participants wore a wearable device (Ava Fertility Tracker bracelet 2.0) that continuously measured the wrist skin temperature during sleep. Daily BBT was measured orally and immediately upon waking up using a computerized fertility tracker with a digital thermometer (Lady-Comp). An at-home luteinizing hormone test was used as the reference standard for ovulation. The diagnostic accuracy of using at least one temperature shift detected by the two temperatures in detecting ovulation was evaluated. For ovulatory cycles, repeated measures correlation was used to examine the correlation between the two temperatures, and mixed effect models were used to determine the agreement between the two temperature curves at different menstrual phases. Wrist skin temperature was more sensitive than BBT (sensitivity 0.62 vs 0.23; P<.001) and had a higher true-positive rate (54.9% vs 20.2%) for detecting ovulation; however, it also had a higher false-positive rate (8.8% vs 3.6%), resulting in lower specificity (0.26 vs 0.70; P=.002). The probability that ovulation occurred when at least one temperature shift was detected was 86.2% for wrist skin temperature and 84.8% for BBT. Both temperatures had low negative predictive values (8.8% for wrist skin temperature and 10.9% for BBT). Significant positive correlation between the two temperatures was only found in the follicular phase (rmcorr correlation coefficient=0.294; P=.001). Both temperatures increased during the postovulatory phase with a greater increase in the wrist skin temperature (range of increase: 0.50 °C vs 0.20 °C). During the menstrual phase, the wrist skin temperature exhibited a greater and more rapid decrease (from 36.13 °C to 35.80 °C) than BBT (from 36.31 °C to 36.27 °C). During the preovulatory phase, there were minimal changes in both temperatures and small variations in the estimated daily difference between the two temperatures, indicating an agreement between the two curves. For women interested in maximizing the chances of pregnancy, wrist skin temperature continuously measured during sleep is more sensitive than BBT for detecting ovulation. The difference in the diagnostic accuracy of these methods was likely attributed to the greater temperature increase in the postovulatory phase and greater temperature decrease during the menstrual phase for the wrist skin temperatures.",['Zhu TY; Rothenbühler M; Hamvas G; Hofmann A; Welter J; Kahr M; Kimmich N; Shilaih M; Leeners B'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34100763,a prospective study included 193 cycles (170 ovulatory and 23 anovulatory) participants wore a wearable device that continuously measured the wrist skin temperature during sleep. the diagnostic accuracy of using at least one temperature shift detected by the two temperatures in detecting ovulation was evaluated.
Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion Combined with Uterine-sparing Pelvic Plexus Block and Partial Adenomyomectomy for Adenomyosis: A Video Case Report.,"Adenomyosis usually causes dysmenorrhea and anemia. Clinically, it is difficult to be treated with medicine or by traditional surgery, however, hysterectomy is always performed for radical treatment. In this article, we introduce a new method that could control the dysmenorrhea and the anemia through laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (LUAO) combined with uterine-sparing pelvic plexus block and partial adenomyomectomy for uterus preservation. Surgical video article. Local institutional review board approval for the video reproduction was obtained. A 42-year-old patient, who had a history of a previous cesarean delivery, was admitted to our department with complaints of progressive dysmenorrhea for more than 5 years and aggravated with anemia for 1 year. The patient had failed treatment with traditional Chinese medicine and gonadotropin-releasing hormone and had to take painkillers for nearly half a year. The patient had no desire for another pregnancy. After careful consideration, the patient strongly rejected hysterectomy and demanded the preservation of the uterus, insisting on the integrity of the organs. A gynecologic examination showed that the uterus was hard and enlarged similar to one that is more than 8 gestational weeks, without tender nodules in the rectouterine pouch. The visual analog scale pain score was 7, and her hemoglobin was 93 g/L (after correction). The preoperative magnetic resonance imaging implied that there was 1 lesion in the posterior wall and the maximum diameter of the lesion was 7.8 cm. We performed laparoscopic partial adenomyomectomy combined with occlusion of uterine artery to limit the amount of intraoperative bleeding, dissected the uterine branch of pelvic plexus nerve, and performed electrocoagulation blocking to relieve the dysmenorrhea. The specific operation procedures are as follows (Video): Firstly, we opened the peritoneum through Cheng's triangle, which contained the external iliac blood vessels, the round ligament, and the infundibulopelvic ligament (Fig. 1). Secondly, we separated the lateral rectal space and exposed the ureter, the internal iliac artery, the uterine artery, and the deep uterine vein. Thirdly, we found that the pelvic plexus was located on the outside of the sacral ligament and was approximately 2 to 3 cm below the ureter, going against the sacral ligament and passing through below the deep uterine vein (Supplemental Video 1). Fourthly, we separated the 4 layers of the paracervix [1]. The first layer included the internal iliac artery and the uterine artery. The second layer was the ureter. The third layer was the deep uterine vein. The last layer was the pelvic plexus, which involved the forward-going bladder branch, the inward-going uterine branch, and the downward-going rectal branch (Supplemental Video 2). These anatomic structures are similar to the complex architecture of an overpass called the Cheng's Cross [2] (Fig. 2). In this operation, only the uterine artery and the uterine branch would be blocked. Finally, we performed the partial adenomyomectomy. The endometrium, the myometrial tissues, and the serosa were repaired in some layers with continuous suture, depending on the depth of incision. The operation time was 92 minutes, and the intraoperative hemorrhage was approximately 50 mL. The patient was able to get out of bed on the first day after the operation and urinate after removing the catheter. On the second day after the surgery, the patient had exhaustion and defecation. From the third day after the surgery, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Goserelin Acetate Sustained-Release Depot,3.6mg each, subcutaneous injection, name of the enterprise: AstraZeneca UK Limited) was used every 4 weeks, with a total of 3 times. Menstruation began on the 67th day after withdrawal of the drug. The results of postoperative condition of the patient followed up at 6 months after surgery were collected as follows: dysmenorrhea was significantly relieved (visual analog scale score was 2), hemoglobin was 123 g/L, and uterine volume was reduced to 43% of preoperative volume. The comparison of the patient's preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed that the uterus was approximately the same size as that of a woman of the same age, and the incision healed well (Fig. 3). Adenomyosis is a common gynecologic disease, mainly occurring in women of childbearing age. Adenomyosis is defined as endometrial glands and stroma that invade the myometrium and is surrounded by chronical inflammation in the endometrium [3]. Secondary dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia are the most common chief complaints in patients with adenomyosis, among which dysmenorrhea is the most unbearable symptom [2]. In the past, we had always treated adenomyosis by hysterectomy [4]. With the continuous pursuit of quality of life, it is difficult to meet clinical needs through drugs and traditional surgical methods. Uterine sparing surgery is a current trend in the treatment of adenomyosis, which enables women to maintain fertility and avoid the effects of hysterectomy on sexual function and mental discomfort. Dysmenorrhea can be divided into peripheral dysmenorrhea and central dysmenorrhea. According to our previous studies on dysmenorrhea, the uterine branch nerve has a controlling effect on dysmenorrhea [2]. The purpose of pelvic plexus uterine branch ablation is to further relieve dysmenorrhea by blocking nerve conduction pathways. Therefore, we selectively blocked the uterine branch nerve to alleviate the dysmenorrhea of adenomyosis. The uterine artery controls 90% of uterine blood flow. According to our team research, LUAO is an effective method to treat symptomatic uterine myomas and adenomyosis. We investigated the morphologic change and apoptosis occurring in myomal and adjacent myometrial tissues after LUAO. We concluded that apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways may lead to reduction of the volume of myoma and myometrium and eventually relief of symptoms [5,6]. We speculated ""single organ shock uterine"" to explain uterine artery occlusion (UAO) mechanism, which was different from uterine artery embolization. The single organ shock theory of UAO can still inhibit the growth of myomas effectively. It is difficult to completely remove adenomyosis lesions during surgery, especially for diffuse adenomyosis. Therefore, in our team, we performed UAO combined with resection of focal lesions in key areas for patients with diffuse adenomyosis, instead of pursuing radical resection [7,8]. The purpose of UAO is to reduce the amount of bleeding during surgery and further atrophy of residual and scattered adenomyosis lesions in utero [5,6]. The intraoperative blocking of the uterine artery can reduce intraoperative bleeding and operation time, improve operation quality, and decrease recurrence rate. In our team, this technique has been used in clinic for more than 10 years. Our previous studies have shown that LUAO combined with pelvic plexus uterine branch nerve block and resection of most of the adenomyosis has achieved satisfactory clinical efficacy as a treatment for adenomyosis [2,3]. With this procedure, we can help patients with adenomyosis retain their uterus and relieve the anxiety caused by hysterectomy. In conclusion, UAO and uterine branch ablation in uterine sparing laparoscopic treatment is a safe and effective method, which may be considered as a good choice for symptomatic adenomyosis.",['Chen D; Ai G; Yang W; Liu J; Luo N; Guo J; Cheng Z'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051355,a 42-year-old patient was admitted to our department with complaints of progressive dysmenorrhea for more than 5 years. the patient had failed treatment with traditional Chinese medicine and gonadotropin-releasing hormone. the patient strongly rejected hysterectomy and demanded the preservation of the uterus.
Differential effects of western versus mediterranean diets and psychosocial stress on ovarian function in female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).,"Ovarian dysfunction increases risk for chronic diseases of aging including cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive impairment, as well as bone and muscle loss which promote frailty. Psychosocial stress can disrupt ovarian function, and recent observations suggest that consumption of a Western Diet may also. Determination of causal relationships among diet, psychosocial stress, and ovarian physiology is difficult in humans. Long-tailed (a.k.a. cynomolgus) macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are an excellent translational model for the study of diet and psychosocial effects on ovarian physiology and aging-related processes. They have 28-day menstrual cycles with hormonal fluctuations like those of women, and similar physiologic responses to alterations and/or cessation of cyclicity. We examined ovarian function in 38 middle-aged socially housed females fed either a Western or Mediterranean diet for 31 months (≈ a 9-year period for humans). During the last year, we examined cycle length and peak progesterone per cycle using blood sampling (3/week) and vaginal swabbing for menses (6/week). Repeated measures analysis revealed a circannual pattern consistent with increased menstrual cycle disturbance during the late Summer and early Fall (F(11,348)= 4.05 p < 0.001). In addition, both Western diet (F(1,34)= 3.99; p = 0.05) and the stress of low social status (F(1,34)= 3.99; p = 0.04) reduced mean progesterone levels. Thus, on average, subordinates in the Western group had the lowest average progesterone levels (10.02 ng/pl). Compared to Western diets, Mediterranean diets exhibited protective effects via menstrual cycle regularity. For dominant monkeys, consuming Mediterranean diets resulted in significantly greater likelihood of having regular menstrual cycles. Mediterranean diets also protected individuals from shorter than normal menstrual cycles. The relationships between diet and menstrual regularity were partially mediated by both adrenal reactivity and social isolation. This study demonstrates the additive negative effects of poor diet and psychosocial stress on ovarian physiology in mid-life and lays the groundwork for future investigations to uncover their impact on metabolic signatures of accelerated aging. The results also suggest that - compared to Western-style diets - a Mediterranean diet may exert a protective influence against ovarian dysfunction and its pathologic sequelae.",['Frye BM; Register TC; Appt SE; Vitolins MZ; Uberseder B; Chen H; Shively CA'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060654,ovarian function in female monkeys increases risk for chronic diseases of aging. ovarian dysfunction increases risk for chronic diseases of aging.
"Acne in pregnancy: A prospective multicenter, cross-sectional study of 295 patients in Turkey.","There are only a few studies on acne in pregnancy. This study was aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and familial characteristics of acne in pregnancy, triggering factors including endocrine diseases, and association of these findings with acne in different trimesters of pregnancy. Pregnant women aged 18 years and older with acne at any stage of pregnancy were consecutively interviewed at the participating centers during the study period from 2016 to 2019. Acne severity was evaluated using the Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale. A total of 295 pregnant women with acne were included, with 167 (56.6%) patients showing mild, 87 (29.5%) moderate, six (12.2%) severe, and five (1.7%) very severe acne. Truncal acne was significantly higher in the third trimester than in the other stages (P < 0.001). Onset of acne before pregnancy, prepubertal, pubertal or adult onset, or acne history in previous pregnancies did not influence acne severity in pregnancy. Women with irregular menstruation before pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, and higher body weight index tended to show severe acne in pregnancy. Severe acne during pregnancy is generally uncommon, while severity of facial acne, truncal acne, and hirsutism is higher in the third trimester than in other trimesters. Acne in pregnancy shares many characteristics with female adult acne. Substantial changes in different kinds of hormones play a more complex role in acne during pregnancy, but the pathogenesis remains to be determined.",['Kutlu Ö; Karadağ AS; Ünal E; Kelekçi KH; Yalçınkaya İyidal A; Topaloğlu Demir F; Aksoy B; Çölgeçen E; Tosun M; Emre S; Tatlıparmak A; Demirseren DD; Kaya Özden H; Öztürk M; Özlü E; Chen W'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32562263,"a prospective multicenter, cross-sectional study of 295 patients in turkey. the study was aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and familial characteristics of acne in pregnancy. 167 (56.6%) patients showed mild, 87 (29.5%) moderate, six (12.2%) severe, and five (1.7%) very severe acne."
Antibacterial activity evaluation of a novel K3-specific phage against Acinetobacter baumannii and evidence for receptor-binding domain transfer across morphologies.,"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) poses a serious public health challenge due to its notorious antimicrobial resistance, particularly carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB). In this study, we isolated a virulent phage, named P1068, from medical wastewater capable of lysing CRAB, primarily targeting the K3 capsule type. Basic characterization showed that P1068 infected the A. baumannii ZWAb014 with an optimal MOI of 1, experienced a latent period of ten minutes and maintained stability over a temperature range of 4 °C to 37 °C and pH range of 3-10. Phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity analyses indicate that P1068 can be classified as a novel species within the genus Obolenskvirus of the Caudoviricetes class as per the most recent virus classification released by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Additionally, according to classical morphological classification, P1068 is identified as a T4-like phage (Myoviridae). Interestingly, we found that the tail fibre protein (TFP) of P1068 shares 74% coverage and 88.99% identity with the TFP of a T7-like phage (Podoviridae), AbKT21phiIII (NC_048142.1). This finding suggests that the TFP gene of phages may undergo horizontal transfer across different genera and morphologies. In vitro antimicrobial assays showed that P1068 exhibited antimicrobial activity against A. baumannii in both biofilm and planktonic states. In mouse models of intraperitoneal infection, P1068 phage protected mice from A. baumannii infection and significantly reduced bacterial loads in various tissues such as the brain, blood, lung, spleen, and liver compared to controls. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that phage P1068 might be a potential candidate for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant and biofilm-forming A. baumannii infections, and expands the understanding of horizontal transfer of phage TFP genes.",['Zheng X; Liu M; Li P; Xu S; Chen L; Xu G; Pang X; Du H; Huo X; Tan Z; Li J; Li Z; Zhang W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39098716,virulent phage named P1068 is a novel species within the genus Obolenskvirus of the Caudoviricetes class. morphological classification suggests that P1068 is a T4-like phage.
Reproductive health issues in Pakistan; do myths take precedence over medical evidence?,"To analyse the prevalence of myths pertinent to healthcare issues of females of reproductive age. This cross-sectional, simple descriptive, knowledge, attitude and practices-education research was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from February to August 2016. A 30-item self-designed questionnaire was applied, collecting demographic details and answers to 21 close-ended questions encompassing the prevalence of myths pertinent to reproductive health issues of women in Pakistan.Every question had three options, Yes(myth), No(correct answer) and Don't Know(unsure). SPSS 21 was used for data analysis. There were 594 participants in the study. The overall mean age was 35.11±12.711 years and the mean duration of education was 9.41±6.353 years. Besides, >50% answers positive for myths and <50% answers positive for myths were given by 326(54.9%) and 268(45.1%) respondents, respectively. The prevalence of myths was directly proportional to age (p=0.004), and inversely proportional to education (p<0.001) and socio-economic class(p<0.001); impact of education was stronger than socio-economic class(Pearson's chi-square being 74.189 and 48.672, respectively).

The effects of obesity on the menstrual cycle.,"The prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity has significantly increased in the United States and worldwide since the 1970s, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The complications of obesity range from negative effects on the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatobiliary, and musculoskeletal systems to higher rates of mental health conditions such as depression and eating disorders among affected individuals. Among adolescent girls, childhood obesity has been associated with the earlier onset of puberty and menarche, which can result in negative psychosocial consequences, as well as adverse effects on physical health in adulthood. The hormones leptin, kisspeptin and insulin, and their actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, have been implicated in the relationship between childhood obesity and the earlier onset of puberty. Obesity in adolescence is also associated with greater menstrual cycle irregularity and the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can result in infrequent or absent menstrual periods, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Hyperandrogenism, higher testosterone and fasting insulin levels, and lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, similar to the laboratory findings seen in patients with PCOS, are also seen in individuals with obesity, and help to explain the overlap in phenotype between patients with obesity and those with PCOS. Finally, obesity has been associated with higher rates of premenstrual disorders, including premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and dysmenorrhea, although the data on dysmenorrhea appears to be mixed. Discussing healthy lifestyle changes and identifying and managing menstrual abnormalities in adolescents with obesity are key to reducing the obstetric and gynecologic complications of obesity in adulthood, including infertility, pregnancy complications, and endometrial cancer.",['Itriyeva K'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35871162,childhood obesity has been associated with the early onset of puberty and menarche. adolescent girls have been associated with the earlier onset of puberty. obesity has been associated with higher rates of mental health conditions.
The study of waiting time to first pregnancy in the south of Iran: A parametric frailty model approach.,"Time to first pregnancy (TTFP) has never been studied in an Iranian setting. Lifestyle, occupational and environmental factors have been suggested to affect the female reproduction. This study was conducted to measure TTFP in the south of Iran and survey the effects of several similar factors on TTFP by frailty models. The data on TTFP were available for 882 women who were randomly selected from the rural population (the south of Iran). Only the first and the planned pregnancies of every woman were included. The data were collected retrospectively by using self-administered questionnaires. Frailty and shared frailty models were used to determine which factors had the highest impact on TTFP. The median TTFP was 6.4 months and several factors were surveyed. However, only the age of marriage, height, maternal education and regularity of menstruation prior to conception were selected in the multivariable models. Among the several factors which were included in the study, the result of frailty model showed that the height, age of marriage and regular menstruation seemed more notable predictors of TTFP.",['Zare N; Nouri B; Moradi F; Parvareh M'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28280795,"study of waiting time to first pregnancy in the south of the country. frailty models were used to determine which factors had the highest impact on TTFP. only the age of marriage, height, maternal education and regularity of menstruation prior to conception were selected in the multivariable models."
"Skin academy: hair, skin, hormones and menopause - current status/knowledge on the management of hair disorders in menopausal women.","Menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea after the final menstrual period. The reduction in ovarian hormones and increased androgen levels can manifest as hair and skin disorders. Although hirsutism, unwanted facial hair, alopecia, skin atrophy and slackness of facial skin are common issues encountered by post-menopausal women, these problems receive very little attention relative to other menopausal symptoms. The visibility of these disorders has been shown to cause significant anxiety and may impact on patients' self-esteem and quality of life, particularly given the strong association of hair and skin with a woman's femininity and beauty, which is demonstrated by extensive marketing by the cosmetic industry targeting this population and the large expenditure on these products by menopausal women. The proportion of the female population who are in the post-menopausal age group is rising. Therefore, the prevalence of these dermatological symptoms is likely to increase. Current therapies aim to rectify underlying hormonal imbalances and improve cosmetic appearance. However, there is little evidence to support treatment for these disorders specifically in post-menopausal women. This review discusses the assessment and treatment of both the physiological and psychological aspects of hair and skin disorders pertinent to the growing post-menopausal population.",['Blume-Peytavi U; Atkin S; Gieler U; Grimalt R'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22503791,menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea after the final menstrual period. reduction in ovarian hormones and increased androgen levels can manifest as hair and skin disorders.
Comparative Analysis of Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential Patterns between Menstruating and Menopausal North Indian Females.,"Various studies suggest a significant impact of gonadal hormones on many neuronal functions, including auditory processing. Although a few researchers have independently investigated the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) patterns during various phases of menstrual cycle and also during menopause, there is an acute paucity of comparative data between their BAEP patterns. This study was conducted to compare the BAEP patterns between normally menstruating females and menopausal females from North India. A cross-sectional study was done on 90 females aged 17-21 years who were in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle and 100 menopausal females aged 46-70 years. BAEP recording was done using standardized protocol. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. It contained mean wave latencies I, II, III, IV, V, and Interpeak Latencies (IPL) I-V, I-III, and III-V. The mean values of latencies of waves I, III, and V and also of IPL I-III, I-V, and III-V were significantly higher (<i>P ></i> 0.05) in menopausal females. However, the difference between mean values of wave latencies II and IV of both groups was statistically non-significant (<i>P ></i> 0.05). The increased latencies in menopausal females indicate subtle degenerative changes that start appearing within the central auditory pathway after menopause and are probably due to a decline in ovarian hormones, especially estrogen.",['Arora S; Mittal S; Gupta S; Loona S; Singh KD; Mehra K'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35300436,study was conducted to compare the BAEP patterns between menstruating and menopausal females. the study was conducted to compare the patterns between normal menstruating females and menopausal females from north India.
Impact of elevated serum estradiol levels before progesterone administration on pregnancy outcomes in frozen-thawed embryo transfer for hormone replacement therapy.,"The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the impact of monitoring serum estradiol (E2) levels before progesterone administration within hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Analyzed HRT-FET cycles conducted at a reproductive center from 2017 to 2022. Serum E2 levels were measured prior to progesterone administration. Multivariate stratified and logistic regression analyses were performed on 26,194 patients grouped according to terciles of serum E2 levels before progesterone administration. The clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) exhibited a gradual decline with increasing serum E2 levels across the three E2 groups. Even after controlling for potential confounders, including female age, body mass index, infertility diagnosis, cycle category, number of embryos transferred, fertilization method, indication for infertility, and endometrial thickness, both CPR and LBR persistently showed a gradual decrease as serum E2 levels increased within the three E2 groups. The same results were obtained by multivariate logistic regression analysis. This large retrospective study indicates that elevated serum E2 levels before progesterone administration during HRT-FET cycles are associated with reduced CPR and LBR post-embryo transfer. Therefore, it is advisable to monitor serum E2 levels and adjust treatment strategies accordingly to maximize patient outcomes.",['Shuai J; Chen Q; Wan S; Chen X; Liu W; Ye H; Huang G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080633,retrospective cohort study aims to investigate impact of monitoring serum estradiol levels before progesterone administration. serum E2 levels were measured prior to progesterone administration. clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) exhibited a gradual decline with increasing serum E2 levels across the three E2 groups.
The cervical transcriptome changes during the menstrual cycle but does not predict the window of implantation.,"The expression of genes in female reproductive organs is influenced by the cyclic changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. While the molecular changes in the endometrium that facilitate embryo implantation have been extensively studied, there is limited knowledge about the impact of the menstrual cycle on cervical cells. Cervical cells can be easily and routinely collected using a cytobrush during gynecological examination, offering a standardized approach for diagnostic testing. In this study we investigated how the transcriptome of cervical cells changes during the menstrual cycle and assessed the utility of these cells to determine endometrial receptivity. Endocervical cells were collected with cytobrushes from 16 healthy women at different menstrual cycle phases in natural cycles and from four women undergoing hormonal replacement cycles. RNA sequencing was applied to gain insight into the transcriptome of cervical cells. Transcriptome analysis identified four differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between early- and mid-secretory samples, suggesting that the transcriptome of cervical cells does not change significantly during the opening of the implantation window. The most differences appeared during the transition to the late secretory phase (2136 DEGs) before the onset of menstruation. Cervical cells collected during hormonal replacement cycles showed 1899 DEGs enriched in immune system processes. The results of our study suggested that cervical cells undergo moderate transcriptomic changes throughout the menstrual cycle; however, these changes do not reflect the gene expression pattern of endometrial tissue and offer little or no potential for endometrial receptivity diagnostics.",['Pathare ADS; Saare M; Meltsov A; Lawarde A; Modhukur V; Kalinina A; Sekavin A; Kukushkina V; Karro H; Salumets A; Peters M'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37519341,cervical transcriptome changes during the menstrual cycle. transcriptome of cervical cells changes during the menstrual cycle. transcriptome of cervical cells does not change significantly during the opening of the implantation window.
Oxidative Stress and Endometriosis: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecologic diseases in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The women affected suffer from pelvic pain and infertility. The complex etiology is still unclear and it is based on three main theories: retrograde menstruation, coelomic metaplasia, and induction theory. Genetics and epigenetics also play a role in the development of endometriosis. Recent studies have put the attention on the role of oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, which may be implicated in the pathophysiology of endometriosis causing a general inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity. Reactive oxygen species are intermediaries produced by normal oxygen metabolism and are inflammatory mediators known to modulate cell proliferation and to have deleterious effects. A systematic review was performed in order to clarify the different roles of oxidative stress and its role in the development of endometriosis. Several issues have been investigated: iron metabolism, oxidative stress markers (in the serum, peritoneal fluid, follicular fluid, peritoneal environment, ovarian cortex, and eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue), genes involved in oxidative stress, endometriosis-associated infertility, and cancer development.",['Scutiero G; Iannone P; Bernardi G; Bonaccorsi G; Spadaro S; Volta CA; Greco P; Nappi L'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29057034,endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecologic diseases in women of reproductive age. it is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. the women affected suffer from pelvic pain and infertility. genetics and epigenetics also play a role in endometriosis.
Wastewater-based epidemiology to monitor 68 NPS/conventional drug use in Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan during and after COVID-19 pandemic.,"Amidst far-reaching COVID-19 effects and social constraints, this study leveraged wastewater-based epidemiology to track 38 conventional drugs and 30 new psychoactive substances (NPS) in northern Taiwan. Analyzing daily samples from four Taipei wastewater plants between September 2021 and January 2024-encompassing club reopenings, holidays, Lunar New Year, an outbreak, and regular periods-thirty-one drugs were detected, including 5 NPS. Tramadol, zolpidem tartrate, CMA, and MDPV were newly detected in Taiwanese sewage with frequency of 1.4 %- 89.0 %. Conventional drug use typically increased post-pandemic, aside from benzodiazepines and methadone. Methamphetamine showed 100 % frequency, indicating ongoing daily consumption despite COVID-19 measures. Methamphetamine and morphine's consumption dipped then rose around club reopening, hinting at limited access. The consumption trend of methadone appeared to compensate for the use of morphine. Ketamine and NPS demonstrated similar patterns throughout the entire period. NPS as party drugs seemed influenced by an unstable supply chain and complexities in implementation. Benzodiazepines, commonly abused alongside synthetic cathinones in Taiwan exhibited an opposing trend to NPS while aligned with acetaminophen, suggesting elevated stress and anxiety levels during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed in drug consumption between weekdays and weekends, potentially indicating that COVID-19 measures blurred the traditional distinctions between these timeframes. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: New psychoactive substances refer to chemically modified variants of controlled drugs designed to mimic the effects of the original drugs while evading modern detection methods, categorizing them as hazardous materials. The study presents a sewage monitoring project conducted from 2021 to 2024, collecting samples from four WWTPs to analyze NPS and conventional drug trends during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings uncovered connections between drug consumption patterns and pandemic-related policies. In light of the persistent drug abuse and their environmental presence, the results bear critical importance for both environmental and public health. We provide a thorough assessment of these relationships and prioritize areas for future research.",['Ting TT; Chen PC; Chang YC; Chiang PJ; Li HC; Chen SH; Chen PC; Chu HT; Chuang PY; Liu YH; Chen PS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38959832,"wastewater-based epidemiology to track 68 NPS/conventional drug use in northern Taiwan. benzodiazepines and methadone showed similar patterns throughout the entire period. benzodiazepines, commonly abused alongside synthetic cathinones, showed an opposing trend to NPS while aligned with the complexities of implementation."
Does Menstrual Health and Endometriosis Education Affect Knowledge Among Middle and Secondary School Students? A Cluster-Randomised Controlled Trial.,"To evaluate whether endometriosis and menstrual health education improves knowledge and attitudes among adolescents and is acceptable. We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in a Canadian school district. Eligible classes were grades 8-12, co-educational, and English. Classes were randomly assigned either to a 60-minute virtual menstrual health and endometriosis education program before (intervention) or after (waitlist control) primary data collection. The primary outcome was change in endometriosis knowledge from baseline to follow-up (∼4 weeks later, 6-item questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were changes in confidence in endometriosis knowledge, prioritisation of menstrual health knowledge, and comfort in discussing menstrual health, as well as intervention acceptability. The sexual health educator and statistician were masked. In April and May 2021, 2 intervention classes and 2 control classes completed the study. In total, 71 students enrolled, and 48 were present on both baseline and follow-up days. Mean age was 15.7 ± 1.6 years, 55% identified as non-White ethnicities, and 53% were female. The knowledge score increased by 1.86 points in the intervention classes compared with 0.30 points in the control classes, with an estimated mean difference of 1.56 (95% CI 1.12-2.00). The intervention classes showed increased confidence in endometriosis knowledge, prioritisation of menstrual health knowledge, and comfort in discussing menstrual health, compared to the control classes. The mean acceptability index was 80 (SD = 10) in the intervention classes and 70 (SD = 20) in the control classes. A brief menstrual health and endometriosis education program improved knowledge and attitudes among adolescents, who considered the program acceptable.",['Wahl K; Albert A; Larente M; Lopez de Arbina E; Kennedy L; Sutherland JL; Imtiaz S; Orr NL; Allaire C; Yong PJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38871121,study conducted in a school district in a Canadian school district. 71 students enrolled in intervention classes and 2 control classes. knowledge score increased by 1.86 points in intervention classes compared with 0.30 points in control classes.
Youth Perspectives and Experiences With Menstruation and Period Poverty.,"Period poverty is the lack of accessible menstrual education or menstrual tools. Millions of women and girls around the world experience period poverty, which can contribute to disparities in school and work performance, as well as overall quality of life. However, not much is known about youth experiences and perceptions of period poverty. This study aims to understand the personal experiences and opinions of American youth regarding knowledge about menstruation and period poverty, as well as to gauge youth attitudes of existing and future period poverty initiatives. The MyVoice nationwide text message poll was used to ask five open-ended questions to over 1,000 youth across the United States aged 14-24 years. Responses were analyzed using content analysis by two independent researchers, and differences in coding were reviewed and resolved by discussion. Overall, 963 youth (80%) responded, and the sample was 54.7% self-reported male with an average age of 20.1 years (standard deviation = 2.3). Three main themes emerged: 1. Most youth, regardless of self-reported gender, have had conversations about periods but comfort discussing the topic varies, 2. Youths' knowledge of menstruation varies with personal experience, or lack thereof, and 3. Some youth have experience with period poverty, and most are overwhelmingly supportive of policies to improve access to period products. These findings suggest that normalization of discussions of menstruation, increasing awareness of the prevalence and impacts of period poverty, and greater implementation of programs to mitigate period poverty are supported by youth, and may reduce period poverty in the United States.",['Wolff C; Waselewski M; Amaro X; Amanze C; Frank A; Chang T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38493390,menstruation and period poverty are the lack of menstrual education or menstrual tools. a study aims to understand the personal experiences and opinions of american youth. the study aims to gauge youth attitudes of existing and future period poverty initiatives.

"Early marriage, education and mental health: experiences of adolescent girls in Mozambique.","Early marriage and maternity represent a violation of human rights and a barrier to achieving gender equality in education. Studies conducted across various regions and countries, including Mozambique, have highlighted the negative consequences of early marriage and maternity, particularly on adolescent girls' physical, educational and mental health. Adolescent girls who marry before the age of 18 are more prone to a broad spectrum of mood, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. In the districts of Maganja da Costa and Morrumbala in Zambézia Province, Mozambique, high rates of early marriage persist despite government policies and interventions. This study aims to understand early marriage's socio-cultural, economic, and psychological drivers and impacts on adolescent girls' lives, focusing on education, mental health, and well-being. This paper used a qualitative research design. We employed a life-story approach and used purposeful sampling to identify participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 participants and the data were analysed using Tesch's thematic analysis approach. Elements contributing to early marriage and pregnancy are intricately linked with socio-cultural elements. These include the induction into specific societal roles, the affirmation of childbearing, the perceived importance of dowry, the impact of rite-of-passage ceremonies, and the cultural significance associated with a girl's initial menstruation. School dropout often originates from geographical and transportation challenges, nudging adolescent girls towards early marriage. In some instances, termination of pregnancy was viewed as a solution, while engaging in sexual activities was seen as a means to inject purpose into their lives or as a response to poverty. Positive changes and emotions were evident, yet regrettably, the ramifications of early pregnancy and marriage were primarily detrimental. These influenced the adolescent girls' interpersonal connections, educational and career opportunities, emotional well-being, and access to support networks. The modern perspective, which advocates for equal educational rights for boys and girls and posits that marriage should occur after the age of 18, contradicts the socio-cultural perspective of adulthood. This study adds to the ongoing efforts to prevent and combat early marriage and maternity in Africa.",['Nhampoca JM; Maritz JE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38933453,"studies have highlighted negative consequences of early marriage and maternity. adolescent girls who marry before the age of 18 are more prone to mood, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders."
Impact of menstrual cycle events on bipolar disorder course: a narrative review of current evidence.,"Several lines of research suggest that reproductive-related hormonal events may affect the course of bipolar disorder in some women. However, data on associations between bipolar disorder and menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause are mixed. This article reviews the literature on the potential effects of menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause on bipolar disorder.A narrative review of published articles on bipolar disorder and menstrual cycle events was conducted. The primary outcome assessed was the impact of menarche, menstrual cycle and menopause on the course of bipolar illness. Databases searched were PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, PsycINFO, Medline, and Cochrane Libraries from inception to August 2021.Twenty-two studies were identified and included in the narrative synthesis. Research suggested that a subset of women with bipolar disorder are vulnerable to the impact of menstrual cycle events. Menarche seems to be associated with age at onset of bipolar illness especially in case of bipolar disorder type I and the specific age at menarche may predict some clinical features of the disorder. Menstrual cycle likely affects the course of bipolar disorder but the pattern of mood variability is not clear. Menopause appears to be not only a period of vulnerability to mood alteration, especially depressive episodes, and impairment of quality of life, but also a potential trigger of bipolar illness onset.The impact of menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause on bipolar disorder is largely understudied. Preliminary evidence suggests that a subset of women with bipolar disorder may have their mood shifts affected by menstrual cycle events, with different patterns depending on the type of bipolar disorder also.

"Premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea: urban-rural and multiethnic differences in perception, impacts, and treatment seeking.","Attitudes toward menarche and menstruation are largely influenced by sociological, cultural, and family environmental factors. Recognizing the influential effects that these factors might have on shaping adolescents' attitudes is crucial in designing a more effective means of transmitting health information. This study aimed to gather an in-depth understanding of perceptions, impacts, and treatment seeking on menstruation-related issues from an ethnically mixed group of rural and urban girls. In total, 27 focus group discussions (172 participants) were conducted between November 2008 and April 2009. Participants were adolescent girls aged 13-19 years, recruited from 7 public secondary schools in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and 4 public secondary schools from the rural districts of Kelantan, in Malaysia. Many participants revealed that they were not given or had not received detailed information about the mechanism or physiology of menstruation prior to its onset. Thus, many described the onset of menarche as shocking, an event for which they were unprepared, and which has had a tremendous impact on their emotions. More positive acceptance of menarche was reported in the urban than with the rural groups. Despite the high prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea, participants across urban-rural and ethnic groups perceived the problems as completely normal, hence they relied on self-care methods and did not want to seek professional treatment. More rural girls compared to urban girls were embarrassed to talk to their mothers or consult their physicians regarding menstruation-related problems. Menstruation-related education would have a positive impact in improving adolescent girls' knowledge and in nurturing a positive attitude toward menstruation-related matters at home, at school, and in the community.",['Wong LP'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21600811,"study aims to gather an in-depth understanding of perceptions, impacts, and treatment seeking on menstruation-related issues from an ethnically mixed group of rural and urban girls. participants were recruited from 7 public secondary schools in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and 4 public secondary schools from the rural districts of Kelantan, in Malaysia."
How do South African policies address provision of contraception among adolescents?," The South African government has pioneered several policy documents that emphasise the importance of sexual and reproductive health (SRH).  We examined how national policies address access and provision of contraception to adolescents in South Africa.  South African national policies.  We systematically searched various academic databases such as EbscoHost, Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, and other relevant sources to obtain 854 policy documents. Using a set of explicit inclusion criteria, we screened and selected 11 South African policies for analysis. Next, we analysed three international policies and frameworks to extract the key elements from them. Thereafter, we used these key elements to develop an analytical framework for conducting the analysis of the South African national policies.  We found that South Africa's SRH policies largely address the provision of contraception by following international guidelines. These policies recognise the value of providing contraception to adolescent girls. However, we also found gaps in some policies, which could impede how they are translated into practice. These include recognising that adolescent boys can play a role in contraception; adolescents have varying SRH needs and are a key stakeholder not only for policy development but also for monitoring and accountability.  With a specific focus on South Africa's contraception services in the public sector, these findings are relevant to policymakers, providers and users of contraceptives.Contribution: This review proposes recommendations that will assist with strengthening health policy development and thus improve primary health care services related to contraception for adolescents.",['Ketye TJ; Babatunde GB; Akintola O'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39099266,the government has pioneered several policy documents that emphasise the importance of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) the government has pioneered several policy documents that emphasise the importance of sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
Necroptosis in recurrent implantation failure: A bioinformatics analysis of key genes and therapeutic targets.,"Recurrent implantation failure (RIF), a major issue in assisted reproductive technology (ART), may be influenced by necroptosis, a form of cell death linked to several diseases. This study was aimed at investigating the involvement of necroptosis in RIF. Using RNA-sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we identified differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (DENRGs) in RIF patients compared with those in controls. Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks were analyzed to identify key genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Finally, potential therapeutic drugs targeting key genes were explored using a Drug Gene Interaction Database. In total, 20 DENRGs associated with RIF were identified, with a focus on 6 key genes (MLKL, FASLG, XIAP, CASP1, BIRC3, and TLR3) implicated in necroptosis and immune processes. These genes were used to develop a predictive model for RIF, which was validated in 2 datasets. The model and TF network analysis underscored the importance of TLR3. Immune infiltration analysis showed reduced levels of 16 immune cells in RIF patients, highlighting immune system alterations. Several drugs targeting CASP1, such as nivocasan and emricasan, were identified as potential treatments. The study sheds light on the role of necroptosis in RIF, identifying key genes and immune alterations that could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. These findings pave the way for future experimental research and clinical applications targeting necroptosis in RIF treatment.",['Xing X; Ni X; Wang J; Shi J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058876,"recurrent implantation failure may be influenced by necroptosis, a form of cell death linked to several diseases. a bioinformatics analysis of key genes and therapeutic targets was used to identify key genes."
Interpretable machine learning models for predicting clinical pregnancies associated with surgical sperm retrieval from testes of different etiologies: a retrospective study.,"The relationship between surgical sperm retrieval of different etiologies and clinical pregnancy is unclear. We aimed to develop a robust and interpretable machine learning (ML) model for predicting clinical pregnancy using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) association of surgical sperm retrieval from testes of different etiologies. A total of 345 infertile couples who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment with surgical sperm retrieval due to different etiologies from February 2020 to March 2023 at the reproductive center were retrospectively analyzed. The six machine learning (ML) models were used to predict the clinical pregnancy of ICSI. After evaluating the performance characteristics of the six ML models, the Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) was selected as the best model, and SHAP was utilized to interpret the XGBoost model for predicting clinical pregnancies and to reveal the decision-making process of the model. Combining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, brier score, and the area under the precision-recall (P-R) curve (AP), the XGBoost model has the best performance (AUROC: 0.858, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.778-0.936, accuracy: 79.71%, brier score: 0.151). The global summary plot of SHAP values shows that the female age is the most important feature influencing the model output. The SHAP plot showed that younger age in females, bigger testicular volume (TV), non-tobacco use, higher anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in females, lower FSH in males, the temporary ejaculatory disorders (TED) group, and not the non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) group all resulted in an increased probability of clinical pregnancy. The XGBoost model predicts clinical pregnancies associated with testicular sperm retrieval of different etiologies with high accuracy, reliability, and robustness. It can provide clinical counseling decisions for patients with surgical sperm retrieval of various etiologies.",['Cao SS; Liu XM; Song BT; Hu YY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075422,"a retrospective study aims to develop a robust and interpretable machine learning model. the model was used to predict clinical pregnancy of ICSI. the XGBoost model has the best performance (AUROC: 0.858, 95% confidence interval (CI:0.778-0.936), accuracy, recall, and brier score."
"Impact of Atopic Dermatitis on Adult Women's Lives: A Survey of 1,009 French Women.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases, and has a higher prevalence among females in adulthood. The aim of this observational, cross-sectional, survey-based study was to evaluate the impact of AD on the daily lives of adult women patients. A scientific committee composed exclusively of women constructed a specific questionnaire in partnership with the French Eczema Association. Severity of AD was evaluated with the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). A sample of 1,009 adult women (mean age ± standard deviation: 41.8 ± 14.2 years) with AD was identified from a representative sample of the French population (82% response rate 1,230 women surveyed). According to the POEM, 50.64% (n = 511) of subjects were identified as having mild AD, 39.35% (n = 397) moderate AD, and 10.01% (n = 101) severe AD. Overall, 67.7% (n = 682) reported that their eczema involved a visible area (face, neck or hands), and 19.6% (n = 198) a sensual area (breasts/chest, genital area or buttocks). Of the 720 women with menstrual cycles, exacerbations of AD were reported to occur mostly before (50.6%) and during (48.3%) menstruation. A small proportion of women, 7.3% (n = 74), reported being afraid of  becoming pregnant because of their eczema. If AD involvement was in a visible area it had a greater impact on romantic relationships, sexual relationships and occupation. If AD involvement was in a sensual area it had a greater influence on romantic relationships and sexuality. Particular attention should be given to patients with localization of AD on the face, neck or hands, as they have a higher risk of social exclusion. Moreover, these results should encourage health professionals to ask patients with AD about the possible involvement of sensual areas.",['Fougerousse AC; Alexandre M; Darrigade AS; Merhand S; Marquié A; Hamza M; Le Fur G; Jachiet M; Bursztejn AC; Taieb C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38738770,"study was conducted by a scientific committee composed exclusively of women. a sample of 1,009 adult women with AD was identified from a representative sample of the population."
"Efficacy of the Flo App in Improving Health Literacy, Menstrual and General Health, and Well-Being in Women: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.","Reproductive health literacy and menstrual health awareness play a crucial role in ensuring the health and well-being of women and people who menstruate. Further, awareness of one's own menstrual cycle patterns and associated symptoms can help individuals identify and manage conditions of the menstrual cycle such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Digital health products, and specifically menstrual health apps, have the potential to effect positive change due to their scalability and ease of access. The primary aim of this study was to measure the efficacy of a menstrual and reproductive health app, Flo, in improving health literacy and health and well-being outcomes in menstruating individuals with and without PMS and PMDD. Further, we explored the possibility that the use of the Flo app could positively influence feelings around reproductive health management and communication about health, menstrual cycle stigma, unplanned pregnancies, quality of life, work productivity, absenteeism, and body image. We conducted 2 pilot, 3-month, unblinded, 2-armed, remote randomized controlled trials on the effects of using the Flo app in a sample of US-based (1) individuals who track their cycles (n=321) or (2) individuals who track their cycles and are affected by PMS or PMDD (n=117). The findings revealed significant improvements at the end of the study period compared to baseline for our primary outcomes of health literacy (cycle tracking: D̄=1.11; t<sub>311</sub>=5.73, P<.001; PMS or PMDD: D̄=1.20; t<sub>115</sub>=3.76, P<.001) and menstrual health awareness (D̄=3.97; t<sub>311</sub>=7.71, P<.001), health and well-being (D̄=3.44; t<sub>311</sub>=5.94, P<.001), and PMS or PMDD symptoms burden (D̄=-7.08; t<sub>115</sub>=-5.44, P<.001). Improvements were also observed for our secondary outcomes of feelings of control and management over health (D̄=1.01; t<sub>311</sub>=5.08, P<.001), communication about health (D̄=0.93; t<sub>311</sub>=2.41, P=.002), menstrual cycle stigma (D̄=-0.61; t<sub>311</sub>=-2.73, P=.007), and fear of unplanned pregnancies (D̄=-0.22; t<sub>311</sub>=-2.11, P=.04) for those who track their cycles, as well as absenteeism from work and education due to PMS or PMDD (D̄=-1.67; t<sub>144</sub>=-2.49, P=.01). These pilot randomized controlled trials demonstrate that the use of the Flo app improves menstrual health literacy and awareness, general health and well-being, and PMS or PMDD symptom burden. Considering the widespread use and affordability of the Flo app, these findings show promise for filling important gaps in current health care provisioning such as improving menstrual knowledge and health.

"Menstrual cycle irregularity during examination among female medical students at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","Menstrual irregularity is defined as any differences in the frequency, irregularity of onset, duration of flow, or volume of blood from the regular menstrual cycle. It is an important medical issue that many medical students suffer from. The study aimed to determine the menstrual cycle abnormalities women experienced during exams and to investigate the most common types of irregularities among female medical students at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among female medical students between September and October 2021 at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. For this study, the estimated sample size (n = 450) was derived from the online Raosoft sample size calculator. Thus, 450 female medical students from second to sixth year were selected through stratified random sampling. A validated online questionnaire collected data about demographics, menstrual irregularities during exams, type of irregularities, menstrual history, family history of menstrual irregularities, premenstrual symptoms, medication use, medical and family consultations, and absenteeism. The chi-squared test (χ<sup>2</sup>) was used to analyze the associations between variables. A total of 48.2% of participants had menstrual irregularities during exams. The most common irregularity was dysmenorrhea (70.9%), followed by a lengthened cycle (45.6%), and heavy bleeding (41.9%). A total of 93% of medical students suffered from premenstrual symptoms and 60.4% used medication such as herbal medication and home remedies to relieve menstrual irregularities, and 12.1% of the students missed classes due to menstrual irregularities. A non-significant relationship was found between menstrual irregularities during exams and students' demographics, academic year, and age at menarche, while oligomenorrhea, a heavier than normal bleed, a longer than normal cycle, and missing classes due to menstrual irregularities were significantly higher among single students as opposed to married students. The results showed that female medical students have a significant frequency of menstruation abnormalities during exams period.

"Acceptability of the menstrual cup among students in further education institutions in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.","The primary objective of this research was to evaluate long-term user acceptability of menstrual cups in a student population in South Africa. A cohort of female students aged 18-24 years attending 10 further education institutions including 22 campus sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were offered menstrual cups after receiving education and training in their use. The students were followed for up to 12 months to assess menstrual cup acceptability, user experiences and continuation. A total of 509 students were enrolled. Disposable pads were the primary menstrual hygiene product used in the 3 months prior to the baseline interview (95.5%, <i>n</i> = 486), and 8.1% (<i>n</i> = 41) of students reported that they had used toilet paper or newspapers. Of the 463 (91%) students interviewed at 1 month follow-up, 86% reported that they had tried to use the menstrual cup. There was mixed reporting on ease of insertion and removal on first use. Of those who attempted use, half (49.5%, <i>n</i> = 197) reported that inserting the menstrual cup on first use was very easy or quite easy. Of those who did not find it easy, 80% reported that two to three insertions were required to achieve comfort. A maximum of five insertions was mentioned to achieve comfort. The majority who had used the cup (>90%) reported they would continue to use it at each follow-up visit. The menstrual cup was well accepted among this student population and should be considered as a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable option in menstrual health management initiatives in South Africa.",['Beksinska M; Nkosi P; Zulu B; Smit J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938248,"students in further education institutions in KwaZulu-Natal, south africa, were offered menstrual cups. the students were followed for up to 12 months to assess menstrual cup acceptability, user experiences and continuation. disposable pads were the primary menstrual hygiene product used in the 3 months prior to the baseline interview."
The Impact of High-Temperature Stress on Gut Microbiota and Reproduction in Siberian Hamsters (<i>Phodopus sungorus</i>).,"Global warming has induced alterations in the grassland ecosystem, such as elevated temperatures and decreased precipitation, which disturb the equilibrium of these ecosystems and impact various physiological processes of grassland rodents, encompassing growth, development, and reproduction. As global warming intensifies, the repercussions of high-temperature stress on small mammals are garnering increased attention. Recently, research has highlighted that the composition and ratio of gut microbiota are not only shaped by environmental factors and the host itself but also reciprocally influence an array of physiological functions and energy metabolism in animals. In this research, we combined 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing with conventional physiological assessments, to elucidate the consequences of high-temperature stress on the gut microbiota structure and reproductive capacity of Siberian hamsters (<i>Phodopus sungorus</i>). The results were as follows: 1. The growth and development of male and female hamsters in the high-temperature group were delayed, with lower body weight and reduced food intake. 2. High temperature inhibits the development of reproductive organs in both female and male hamsters. 3. High temperature changes the composition and proportion of gut microbiota, reducing bacteria that promote reproduction, such as <i>Pseudobutyricoccus, Ruminiclostridium-E</i>, <i>Sporofaciens</i>, <i>UMGS1071</i>, and <i>CAG_353</i>. Consequently, our study elucidates the specific impacts of high-temperature stress on the gut microbiota dynamics and reproductive health of Siberian hamsters, thereby furnishing insights for managing rodent populations amidst global climatic shifts. It also offers a valuable framework for understanding seasonal variations in mammalian reproductive strategies, contributing to the broader discourse on conservation and adaptation under changing environmental conditions.",['Shen W; Gao P; Zhou K; Li J; Bo T; Xu D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39065194,high-temperature stress has induced alterations in the grassland ecosystem. this is causing alterations in the grassland ecosystem. this is causing alterations in the grassland ecosystem.
Female-specific health problems in mental patients.,"Significant sex differences have been described for mental disorders in terms of prevalence, symptom presentation and prescription of psychotropic medication. Most of the published studies and reviews emphasize the impact of female-specific reproductive events on the course of the mental illness or sex difference of the adverse effects of psychotropic medication or the concerns about treatment of female patients during the perinatal period. Different from other reviews, we will summarize the effects of current mental disorder/psychotropic medication on the female-specific reproduction-related events (such as menstrual regularity, pregnancy, postpartum period and menopause). A number of recent studies have highlighted the adverse effects of psychotropic agents on the female reproductive system, especially on the regularity of the menstrual cycle or on the female gonadal hormones. Without any medication, disturbances of the female gonadal system are observed especially among severely mentally ill female patients. In the studies, the prevalence of female-specific gonadal abnormalities and their mechanism of action, prevention and recommendations are given in detail. The field of reproductive psychiatry is rapidly evolving. There is increasing evidence that clinicians should be aware of female medical health while treating severely mentally ill female patients. Analyzing the present data will further advance our understanding of treatment safety and impact of untreated mental illness in women.",['Akdeniz F'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20520545,significant sex differences have been described for mental disorders. most of the published studies and reviews emphasize the impact of female-specific reproductive events on the course of the mental illness.
"Status of reproductive health knowledge amongst High School girls in selected secondary schools, Limpopo Province, South Africa.","Among all age groups, knowledge of reproductive health can prevent unplanned pregnancy and STIs. The study assessed the status of reproductive health knowledge among secondary school girls in Limpopo Province, South Africa. A cross-sectional descriptive study design was conducted among secondary school girls between the ages of 14 and 19. A total of three hundred and forty (N=340) eligible learners were selected using stratified random sampling method. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection and data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. All ethical considerations were ensured throughout the study. About 184(56%) of the respondents were aged between 14 and 16 years, and 59% were grade nine and ten. The majority (72%; n=239) of the respondents stayed in rural areas and attended public schools (83%;n=274). Half (51%) of the study respondents had no idea about menstruation. Nine percent (24) of the respondents mentioned ICUD as a method of contraception. HIV/AIDS was the most common STI infection known by respondents at 52%. Oral and injectable contraceptives 72(35%) were cited as the most known methods to prevent unplanned pregnancies.

Navigating Nasal Surges: Understanding Catamenial Epistaxis.,"Catamenial epistaxis is a rare form of epistaxis (nosebleed) that occurs in women during menstruation due to hormonal changes. There are numerous hypotheses on the cellular mechanisms and pathophysiology of endometriosis. Endometriosis may present a wide range of symptoms depending on where endometrial tissue was implanted. This entity's diagnosis is neither simple nor difficult. There are numerous clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques in use, but none of them is considered to be the best. Every woman who experiences recurrent symptoms (such as epistaxis and hemoptysis) of extrapelvic organs should be clinically suspicious of endometriosis because of its multipotent location and the variety of clinical manifestations of the condition. This case report demonstrates that periodic epistaxis may infrequently be the root cause of the extra pelvic endometrium in the nasal septum in a woman who has had treatment for recurrent pelvic discomfort and dysmenorrhea.",['Batra N; Gemnani R; Singh Thakur A; Kumar S; Acharya S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37872894,catamenial epistaxis is a rare form of epistaxis (nosebleed) that occurs in women during menstruation due to hormonal changes. there are numerous hypotheses on the cellular mechanisms and pathophysiology of endometriosis.

Comparison of goserelin and leuprorelin for ovarian protection during chemotherapy in young patients with breast cancer.,"Although different gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may have different effects, their effect of ovarian protection during chemotherapy for breast cancer has not been compared. This study aimed to compare the effects of goserelin and leuprorelin for ovarian protection during chemotherapy in young patients with breast cancer. This prospective study analyzed 193 patients with breast cancer aged ≤ 40 years who had regular menstruation and serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels ≥ 1 ng/mL before treatment. Patients received either goserelin or leuprorelin for ovarian protection during doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Resumption of menstruation and changes in serum levels of AMH were compared between the two groups at 12 months after completion of chemotherapy. The mean age and the pretreatment serum AMH level were 33.2 years and 4.4 ng/mL in goserelin group and 34.2 years and 4.0 ng/mL in leuprorelin group. The proportion of patients who resumed menstruation was not different between the goserelin (94.4%) and leuprorelin (95.3%) groups at 12 months after chemotherapy completion. Serum AMH levels decreased significantly in both the goserelin (from 4.4 to 1.2 ng/mL) and leuprorelin (from 4.0 to 1.2 ng/mL) groups, with no statistical significance. In addition, no difference was found in the proportion of patients with serum AMH levels ≥ 1 ng/mL between the goserelin (49.5%) and leuprorelin (44.2%) groups at 12 months after chemotherapy.

"A comparative study of the knowledge and practices related to menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls in urban and rural areas of Sindh, Pakistan: A cross-sectional study.","Menstrual hygiene management plays a significant role in the achievement of sustainable development goals, including good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, women's empowerment, and sanitation. Even though the United Nations emphasizes menstrual hygiene management as a global public health and human rights issue, studies from different parts of the world have shown there is a lack of policies in this area that affects adolescent girls. The study aimed to assess the menstrual-related knowledge and practices of adolescent girls (10-18 years) attending urban and rural public schools of district Khairpur of province Sindh of Pakistan. This research is an analytical cross-sectional study design. Adolescent girls (<i>n</i> = 310), 159 girls from urban and 159 girls from rural schools, were enrolled. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires. Knowledge was considered satisfactory if the participant scored ⩾12/20, and <12/20 was considered unsatisfactory knowledge. Practice scores were considered good for >10 and poor for <10. Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0 was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation were calculated. The chi-square test was used to assess and compare the differences between practices and knowledge of menstrual hygiene management between urban and rural adolescent school girls. We found significant differences in menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls between urban and rural areas. Approximately two-thirds of the total school girls thought that school management had inadequate resources and toilet facilities (rural: 76% versus urban: 62%). The major source of knowledge in adolescent rural and urban girls for menstrual-related matters was mothers. More girls from the urban school (81%) were aware of using sanitary pads during menstruation. The majority of the girls from urban areas showed satisfactory knowledge whereas only 38% of rural girls were shown to have satisfactory results. Nearly 71% of urban girls were found to have good practices when compared with rural girls (12%). With further importance by the United Nations on female education in less developed regions, where the health of women is usually given less importance, policies are required on the inclusion of reproductive health of female adolescents in the curriculum.",['Aziz A; Memon S; Aziz F; Memon F; Khowaja BMH; Naeem Zafar S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38385267,"study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices of adolescent girls. study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices of adolescent girls. study was conducted in urban and rural areas of Sindh, Pakistan."
Effects of physical activity and self-control on mobile phone addiction in college students: a cross-lagged study in China.,"This study aims to investigate the impact of physical activity and self-control on college students' mobile phone addiction through cross-lagged longitudinal surveys, addressing the limitations of previous cross-sectional studies. A total of 414 college students were tracked three times during a 12-month period using the Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3), the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS), and the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS). AMOS25.0 software was used to construct the cross-lagged relationship model, and the maximum likelihood approach was employed to investigate the model fitting. The asynchronous correlation between variables was investigated from the time series through the cross-lagged path coefficient. The fitting indexes of the cross-lagged model showed <i>x</i> <sup>2</sup>/df = 5.098, GFI = 0.977, NFI = 0.969, IFI = 0.975, CFI = 0.974; RMSEA = 0.100, and SRMR = 0.030.

Dynamic pH regulation drives Nitrosomonas for high-rate stable acidic partial nitritation.,"How to intensify the ammonia oxidation rate (AOR) is still a bottleneck impeding the technology development for the innovative acidic partial nitritation because the eosinophilic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as Nitrosoglobus or Nitrosospira, were inhibited by the high-level free nitrous acid (FNA) accumulation in acidic environments. In this study, an innovative approach of dynamic acidic pH regulation control strategy was proposed to realize high-rate acidic partial nitritation driven by common AOB genus Nitrosomonas. The acidic partial nitrification process was carried out in a laboratory-scale sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor (SBMBBR) for long-term (700 days) to track the effect of dynamic acidic pH on nitrifying bacterial activity. The results indicated that the influent NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N concentration was about 100 mg/L, the nitrite accumulation ratio was exceeding 90%, and the maximum AOR can reach 14.5 ± 2.6 mg N L<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. Although the half-saturation inhibition constant of NOB (K<sub>I_FNA(AOB)</sub>) reached 0.37 ± 0.10 mg HNO<sub>2</sub>N/L and showed extreme adaptability in FNA, the inactivation effect of FNA (6.1 mg HNO<sub>2</sub>N/L) for NOB was much greater than that of AOB, with inactivation rates of 0.61 ± 0.08 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.06 ± 0.01 h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The effluent pH was gradually reduced to 4.5 by ammonia oxidation process and the periodic FNA concentration reached 6.5 mg HNO<sub>2</sub>N/L to inactivate nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) without negatively affecting Nitrosomonas during long-term operation. This result provides new insights for the future implementation of high-rate stabilized acidic partial nitritation by Nitrosomonas.",['Li S; Kang X; Zuo Z; Islam MS; Yang S; Liu Y; Huang X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39018585,eosinophilic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were inhibited by the high-level free nitrous acid (FNA) accumulation in acidic environments. the acidic partial nitritation process was carried out in a laboratory-scale sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor.
"Wastewater Surveillance to Confirm Differences in Influenza A Infection between Michigan, USA, and Ontario, Canada, September 2022-March 2023.","Wastewater surveillance is an effective way to track the prevalence of infectious agents within a community and, potentially, the spread of pathogens between jurisdictions. We conducted a retrospective wastewater surveillance study of the 2022-23 influenza season in 2 communities, Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor-Essex, Ontario, Canada, that form North America's largest cross-border conurbation. We observed a positive relationship between influenza-related hospitalizations and the influenza A virus (IAV) wastewater signal in Windsor-Essex (ρ = 0.785; p<0.001) and an association between influenza-related hospitalizations in Michigan and the IAV wastewater signal for Detroit (ρ = 0.769; p<0.001). Time-lagged cross correlation and qualitative examination of wastewater signal in the monitored sewersheds showed the peak of the IAV season in Detroit was delayed behind Windsor-Essex by 3 weeks.

Prospective multicenter study of continuous tonic-clonic seizure monitoring on Apple Watch in epilepsy monitoring units and ambulatory environments.,"Evaluate the performance of a custom application developed for tonic-clonic seizure (TCS) monitoring on a consumer-wearable (Apple Watch) device. Participants with a history of convulsive epileptic seizures were recruited for either Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) or ambulatory (AMB) monitoring; participants without epilepsy (normal controls [NC]) were also enrolled in the AMB group. Both EMU and AMB participants wore an Apple Watch with a research app that continuously recorded accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, and ran a fixed-and-frozen tonic-clonic seizure detection algorithm during the testing period. This algorithm had been previously developed and validated using a separate training dataset. All EMU convulsive events were validated by video-electroencephalography (video-EEG); AMB events were validated by caregiver reporting and follow-ups. Device performance was characterized and compared to prior monitoring devices through sensitivity, false alarm rate (FAR; false-alarms per 24 h), precision, and detection delay (latency). The EMU group had 85 participants (4,279 h, 19 TCS from 15 participants) enrolled across four EMUs; the AMB group had 21 participants (13 outpatient, 8 NC, 6,735 h, 10 TCS from 3 participants). All but one AMB participant completed the study. Device performance in the EMU group included a sensitivity of 100 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 79-100 %]; an FAR of 0.05 [0.02, 0.08] per 24 h; a precision of 68 % [48 %, 83 %]; and a latency of 32.07 s [standard deviation (std) 10.22 s]. The AMB group had a sensitivity of 100 % [66-100 %]; an FAR of 0.13 [0.08, 0.24] per 24 h; a precision of 22 % [11 %, 37 %]; and a latency of 37.38 s [13.24 s]. Notably, a single AMB participant was responsible for 8 of 31 false alarms. The AMB FAR excluding this participant was 0.10 [0.07, 0.14] per 24 h. This study demonstrates the practicability of TCS monitoring on a popular consumer wearable (Apple Watch) in daily use for people with epilepsy.

"Menstrual practices, fertility intentions and decision-making regarding family planning by women belonging to various indigenous groups of Wayanad- A qualitative study.","Among the different social groups in India, the tribes are the most vulnerable and socioeconomically deprived. The tribal population is distinct from the general population in terms of their unique cultural, traditional, and reproductive health practices. Therefore, the aim of the study was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the menstrual practices, fertility intentions and decision-making regarding family planning among various indigenous tribal women of Kerala. A qualitative study was conducted among the tribal women of Wayanad district using the grounded theory approach. Using purposive sampling 16 in-depth interviews, 6 key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussion (FGD) s were conducted. Interview guides were developed for in-depth interviews, key-informant interviews, and focus group discussion through extensive formative research with literature reviews and taking expert opinions. The interviews were conducted among women of reproductive age and their spouses hailing from Paniya and Kurichiya tribal groups in Kalpetta and Mananthavady areas of Wayanad district. Key informant interviews were also conducted among doctors, pharmacists, and community health workers. The key findings of this study were the identification of a web of cultural practices pertaining to menstruation among persons of tribal origin. Unique traditional practices such as ""Valayamapura"" and ""Thirandukalyanam"" were reported and most of the women were keen to carry it forward. Fertility desires among couples were found to be not significantly influenced by any gender bias. Decision-making regarding family size were found to be on a mutual agreement between the spouses. The tribal women were aware of modern spacing methods, but preferred natural methods of contraception for temporary use and tubectomy as the permanent method. Non-contraceptive use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) was prevalent, and the majority took it occasionally for postponement of menstruation to attend various social events. Menstruation-related myths and practices are prevalent and require educational interventions. More focus needs to be given to male sterilization as the permanent method of contraception. The study underscores the need to address gender inequalities and attitudes among tribal populations and to increase efforts to promote higher education among the tribes for busting cultural myths and practices.",['Sreedevi A; George LS; Varughese SA; Najeeb SS; Aravindan L; Anvar R; Georgy S; Menon VB; Sathish S; Nedungadi P'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37636171,qualitative study conducted among tribal women of Wayanad district. study aims to conduct exploratory analysis of menstrual practices. women of reproductive age and spouses from various tribal groups.

Subdermal implantable contraceptives versus other forms of reversible contraceptives or other implants as effective methods of preventing pregnancy.,"Implantable methods of contraception offer long-acting reversible contraception. Their uptake rate in comparison to other contraceptive methods, particularly in developed countries, has historically been low. To assess the contraceptive effectiveness, tolerability and acceptability of subdermal implants in comparison to other reversible contraceptive methods. Literature were identified through database searches, reference lists and individuals/organisations working in the contraceptive field. All randomised and controlled trials comparing subdermal implants with other forms of reversible contraceptives and reporting on pre-determined outcomes in women of reproductive years. Primary outcomes were pregnancy and continuation. Quality assessment of studies and data extraction were completed independently by two reviewers. A quality checklist was designed to identify general methodological and contraceptive specific factors. Study authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to provide additional data.Data were collected on pregnancy rates, continuation, side effects and adverse events. All nine identified trials compared different types of contraceptive implant. Eight, involving 1578 women, compared Implanon with Norplant , and one, involving 1198 women, compared Jadelle with Norplant. There was no difference between Implanon and Norplant for contraceptive effectiveness rates or continuation over 4 years. Both were highly effective methods of contraception with no pregnancies occurring in any of the trials during 26,972 and 28,108 women months of follow up respectively. The most common side-effect with Implanon and Norplant was changes in bleeding pattern. The pattern with Implanon was initially more variable, bleeding with both implants became less frequent with duration of use. After two years use the amenorrhoea rate was significantly higher with Implanon. The trials reported no significant difference in hormonal side-effects or adverse events. Implanon was significantly quicker to insert and remove than Norplant. There was no difference in contraceptive effectiveness and in continuation rates between Jadelle and Norplant. Jadelle was significantly quicker to remove than Norplant. Implanon, Norplant and Jadelle are highly effective contraceptive methods. No significant differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness or continuation. The most common side-effect with all implants was unpredictable vaginal bleeding.

Urban-rural disparities in minimum acceptable diet intake among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia: A multivariable Decomposition analysis of Ethiopian demographic and health survey 2019.,"The achievement of the minimum acceptable diet intake (MAD) stands at 14% among urban and 10% among rural under-five children in Ethiopia. Consequently, identifying the determinants of the urban-rural gap is vital for advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), fostering healthier communities, and developing evidence-driven approaches to enhance health outcomes and address disparities. The objective of the study was to decompose the urban-rural disparities in minimum acceptable diet intake in Ethiopia using the Ethiopian Mini-Demographic and Health Survey 2019 data. The study was conducted using the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2019 report. A total of 1,496 weighted children aged 6-23 months were included using stratified sampling techniques. The main outcome variable minimum acceptable diet was calculated as a combined proportion of minimum dietary diversity and minimum meal frequency. A decomposition analysis was used to analyze the factors associated with the urban-rural discrepancy of minimum acceptable diet intake, and the results were presented using tables and figures. The magnitude of minimum acceptable diet among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia was 11.0%. There has been a significant disparity in the intake of minimum acceptable diet between urban and rural under-five children with 14 and 10%, respectively. Endowment factors were responsible for 70.2% of the discrepancy, followed by 45.1% with behavioral coefficients. Educational status of college and above was responsible for narrowing the gap between urban and rural residents by 23.9% (β = 0.1313, 95% CI: 0.0332-0.245). The number of children in the household and the age of the child between 18 and 23 months were responsible for widening the gap in minimum acceptable diet intake discrepancy between urban and rural residents by 30.7% and 3.36%, respectively (β = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.003 to -0.0011 and β = -30.7, 95% CI: -0.025 - -0.0085). From the effect coefficients, the effect of institutional delivery was responsible for 1.99% of the widening of the gap between urban and rural residents in minimum acceptable diet intake (β = -0.0862, 95% CI: -0.1711 - -0.0012). There is a significant variation between urban and rural residents in minimum acceptable diet. The larger portion of the discrepancy was explained by the endowment effect. Educational status of mothers with college and above, parity, age of child, and place of delivery were the significant factors contributing to the discrepancy of minimum acceptable diet intake between urban and rural residents.",['Mohammed A; Tareke AA; Keleb A; Kebede N; Tsega Y; Endawkie A; Kebede SD; Mesfin Abera K; Tilahun Abeje E; Bekele Enyew E; Daba C; Asmare L; Bayou FD; Endris H; Arefaynie M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39086809,the achievement of the minimum acceptable diet intake stands at 14% among urban and 10% among rural under-five children in Ethiopia. identifying the determinants of the urban-rural gap is vital for advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
A systematic review of gender-responsive and integrated substance use disorder treatment programs for women with co-occurring disorders.,"<i>Background:</i> Integrated and gender-responsive interventions, designed to target co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders in women, may be effective in addressing gender-specific challenges.<i>Objectives:</i> This systematic review aims to identify integrated gender-responsive substance use disorder treatments for women, summarize evaluations of these treatments, and address gaps in the literature.<i>Methods:</i> We searched PsycINFO, PubMed, and MEDLINE on September 24, 2021, and March 10, 2022. Included articles were randomized-controlled trials, secondary analyses of naturalistic studies, or open-label studies of integrated and gender-responsive treatments from any year that assessed both substance use and mental health/trauma outcomes.<i>Results:</i> We identified N = 24 studies (participants = 3,396; 100% women) examining Seeking Safety, Helping Women Recover and Beyond Trauma, A Woman's Path to Recovery, Modified Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM), Breaking the Cycle, VOICES, Understanding and Overcoming Substance Misuse, Women's Recovery Group, Female Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Moment by Moment in Women's Recovery. Across treatments there were significant improvements over time; Seeking Safety, Helping Women Recover, and TREM were associated with significantly better substance use and mental health outcomes relative to the comparison groups.<i>Conclusions:</i> Integrated gender-responsive treatments are a promising approach to treating women with co-occurring substance use and mental health concerns, and broad clinical implementation stands to benefit women. However, there remains a lack of studies evaluating substance use treatments in women with severe mental illness (e.g., psychotic-spectrum disorders) who differ in their needs and capacity.",['Johnstone S; Dela Cruz GA; Kalb N; Tyagi SV; Potenza MN; George TP; Castle DJ'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36283062,systematic review of integrated and gender-responsive substance use disorder treatment programs for women with co-occurring disorders. aims to identify integrated and gender-responsive treatment programs for women with co-occurring disorders.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in Alzheimer's disease: A genetic and proteomic multi-cohort study.,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a hepatic enzyme that regulates circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by binding to LDL receptors (LDLR) and promoting their degradation. Although PCSK9 inhibitors were shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, a warning was issued concerning their possible impact on cognitive functions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is believed that cognitive impairment is associated with cholesterol metabolism alterations, which could involve PCSK9. The main objective of this study is to determine if PCSK9 plays a significant role in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease when the pathophysiological markers of AD unfolds and, later, when cognitive symptoms emerge. To test if PCSK9 is associated with AD pathology, we measured its expression levels in 65 autopsy confirmed AD brains and 45 age and gender matched controls. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCSK9 was elevated in frontal cortices of AD subjects compared to controls, both at the mRNA and protein levels. LDLR protein levels were unchanged in AD frontal cortices, despite and upregulation at the mRNA level. To verify if PCSK9 dysregulation was observable before the onset of AD, we measured its expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 104 ""at-risk"" subjects and contrasted it with known apolipoproteins levels and specific AD biomarkers using ELISAs. Positive correlations were found between CSF PCSK9 and apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ or CLU), apolipoprotein B (APOB), phospho Tau (pTau) and total Tau. To investigate if PCSK9 levels were driven by genetic variants, we conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study using bioinformatic tools and found two polymorphisms in strong association.

Association between preconception body mass index and fertility in adult female: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity potentially reduces fertility, but systematic reviews are lacking to summarize the existing literature. Therefore, we systematically summarized the association between preconception body mass index (BMI) and fertility in adult female based on existing reports. Up to September 2023, we conducted literature retrievals in different databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Wiley, and ScienceDirect. Finally, 18 studies were included. Female with overweight/obesity (FOR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90), obesity (FOR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.83), and overweight (FOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99) was associated with the significant time-to-pregnancy (TTP) prolongation (reduced fecundability). Interestingly, underweight was moderately associated with prolonged TTP in females (FOR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). Female overweight/obesity was associated with an increased risk of subfecundity (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.72) and infertility (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.31-1.94). The findings emphasize the importance of considering appropriate preconception BMI at the population level for female fertility outcomes. In particular, prepregnancy obesity in females is strongly associated with prolonged TTP and increased risk of subfecundity. Scientific management of preconception BMI may improve fertility.",['Zhou J; Zhang Y; Teng Y; Dou L; Chen H; Tao F; Huang K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39054661,a systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted. the association between preconception body mass index and fertility in adult females is lacking.
Outcomes following Arthroscopic Treatment of Off-Track Hill-Sachs Lesions Using Fresh Osteochondral Allograft Plugs: A Case Series.,"Osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is a well-described technique for the treatment of large, engaging Hill-Sachs lesions (HSLs). Traditionally, OCAs are size-matched to the defect, which can be expensive and time-consuming, and the majority of described techniques require an open approach. Recently, an all-arthroscopic approach to Hill-Sachs OCA transplantation using premade plugs was described, eliminating the need for size-matching and graft harvest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative outcomes of patients who have undergone arthroscopic treatment of HSLs using premade OCA plugs. We hypothesized that these patients would have improved pain and function without recurrent instability. A retrospective chart review was performed using operative reports for a single surgeon with search terms ""Hill-Sachs"" and ""allograft."" Patients were excluded if an open approach was used or if graft harvest was performed. Postoperative imaging was reviewed to assess for graft incorporation and reconstitution of the HSL. Recurrent instability and reoperation were recorded. Patients completed surveys including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI). Five patients were identified through chart review and met inclusion criteria. All patients underwent concurrent labral repair and two patients underwent a concurrent open Latarjet procedure. Postoperative radiographs showed reconstitution of the HSLs in all patients. There were no complications in the postoperative period with no recurrent instability or reoperations in any patient. The average ASES score was 87% (higher score indicating better outcome) with standard deviation 9.7, and the average WOSI score was 27% (lower score indicating better outcome) with standard deviation 8.3. Favorable outcomes can be expected after arthroscopic treatment of Hill-Sachs lesions using premade OCA plugs. Further research is needed to assess larger patient cohorts and compare outcomes to size-matched approaches.",['George A; Kraeutler MJ; Lintner DM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097139,a retrospective chart review was performed using operative reports for a single surgeon. patients excluded if open approach was used or graft harvest was performed. a retrospective chart review was performed using operative reports for a single surgeon.
Investigation of postural sensory organization in women with and without primary dysmenorrhea in three phases of the menstrual cycle.,"The effects of the menstrual cycle in women with and without primary dysmenorrhea on phase-related postural sensory organization are controversial. This study was carried out to examine postural sensory organization in three phases of the menstrual cycle in women with and without primary dysmenorrhea and to evaluate whether there is a difference between women with/without primary dysmenorrhea in this regard. Women aged 18-30 years were divided into two groups as primary dysmenorrhea group (PDG, n = 14) and control group (CG, n = 15). Computerized dynamic posturography were applied to the participants on the follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Outcome measures were antero-posterior and medio-lateral Sensory Organization Test (SOT-somatosensory, vestibular and visual scores) and Limits of Stability test (LoS). The findings obtained were analyzed with the two-factor ANOVA, paired samples t test, and independent samples t test. In the PDG, follicular phase antero-posterior somatosensory scores were lower compared to luteal phase (p = 0.002). Follicular phase antero-posterior and medio-lateral vestibular scores were lower than ovulation (p = 0.003, p = 0.004, respectively) and luteal (p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively) phases. Follicular phase LoS scores were lower than ovulation (p = 0.001) and luteal (p = 0.002) phases. In the CG, ovulation phase antero-posterior somatosensory scores were lower than follicular phase (p = 0.003). Follicular phase LoS scores were lower than ovulation phase (p = 0.002). The PDG had lower follicular phase antero-posterior somatosensory (p = 0.019), vestibular (p = 0.031), and medio-lateral somatosensory (p = 0.019) scores than those of the CG. The PDG had lower luteal phase antero-posterior somatosensory scores than those of the CG (p = 0.029). The PDG showed lower follicular phase LoS scores than those of the CG (p = 0.009). This study revealed that primary dysmenorrhea impairs postural sensory organization. Decreased sensory organization may predispose women to injury. The risk of injury should be investigated and necessary precautions should be taken.",['Baran E; Yılmaz T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38277764,women aged 18-30 years were divided into two groups as primary dysmenorrhea group. results were antero-posterior and medio-lateral sensory organization test.
Prevalence and frequency of menstrual cycle symptoms are associated with availability to train and compete: a study of 6812 exercising women recruited using the Strava exercise app.,"The menstrual cycle can affect sports participation and exercise performance. There are very few data on specific menstrual cycle symptoms (symptoms during various phases of the cycle, not only during menstruation) experienced by exercising women. We aimed to characterise the most common symptoms, as well as the number and frequency of symptoms, and evaluate whether menstrual cycle symptoms are associated with sporting outcomes. 6812 adult women of reproductive age (mean age: 38.3 (8.7) years) who were not using combined hormonal contraception were recruited via the Strava exercise app user database and completed a 39-part survey. Respondents were from seven geographical areas, and the questions were translated and localised to each region (Brazil, n=892; France, n=1355; Germany, n=839; Spain, n=834; UK and Ireland, n=1350; and USA, n=1542). The survey captured exercise behaviours, current menstrual status, presence and frequency of menstrual cycle symptoms, medication use for symptoms, perceived effects of the menstrual cycle on exercise and work behaviours, and history of hormonal contraception use. We propose a novel Menstrual Symptom index (MSi) based on the presence and frequency of 18 commonly reported symptoms (range 0-54, where 54 would correspond to all 18 symptoms each occurring very frequently). The most prevalent menstrual cycle symptoms were mood changes/anxiety (90.6%), tiredness/fatigue (86.2%), stomach cramps (84.2%) and breast pain/tenderness (83.1%). After controlling for body mass index, training volume and age, the MSi was associated with a greater likelihood of missing or changing training (OR=1.09 (CI 1.08 to 1.10); p≤0.05), missing a sporting event/competition (OR=1.07 (CI 1.06 to 1.08); p≤0.05), absenteeism from work/academia (OR=1.08 (CI 1.07 to 1.09); p≤0.05) and use of pain medication (OR=1.09 (CI 1.08 to 1.09); p≤0.05). Menstrual cycle symptoms are very common in exercising women, and women report that these symptoms compromise their exercise participation and work capacity. The MSi needs to be formally validated (psychometrics); at present, it provides an easy way to quantify the frequency of menstrual cycle symptoms.",['Bruinvels G; Goldsmith E; Blagrove R; Simpkin A; Lewis N; Morton K; Suppiah A; Rogers JP; Ackerman KE; Newell J; Pedlar C'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33199360,study of 6812 exercising women recruited using the Strava exercise app. menstrual cycle symptoms can affect sports participation and exercise performance. most common menstrual cycle symptoms were symptoms during various phases of the cycle.
Differentiating constitutional thinness from anorexia nervosa in DSM 5 era.,"Constitutional thinness (CT) is an underweight state characterized by normal menstruations and no change in feeding behaviour. Thinness is the only resemblance between Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and CT. Removal of amenorrhea from the new DSM 5 definition of AN might result in misdiagnosis between these two populations. The objective of this study was to compare CT, AN and Control subjects in terms of biological, anthropometric, and psychological markers in order to better distinguish AN from CT subjects. Body composition, nutritional markers, pituitary hormones, bone markers and psychological scores were evaluated in three groups of young women: fifty-six CT, forty restrictive-type AN and fifty-four Control subjects. For every marker, a receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve was calculated to evaluate the accuracy of differentiation between AN and CT groups. For most studied parameters, CT subjects were similar to Controls but dramatically different from AN subjects. DEBQ Restrained Eating subscale score was identified by ROC data analysis as the only psychological parameter tested to successfully differentiate AN from CT. Free-T3 and Leptin were shown to be powerful markers to differentiate AN and CT populations as they were highly specific and sensitive ones. The exclusive use of psychological testing criteria is not always sufficient to differentiate AN and CT patients. Minimally, additional testing of Free T3 levels, which is cheap and widely accessible for general practitioners, should be completed to avoid misdiagnosis which could result in the implementation of ineffective treatment plans and social stigmatization for CT women.",['Estour B; Marouani N; Sigaud T; Lang F; Fakra E; Ling Y; Diamondé A; Minnion JS; Galusca B; Germain N'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28692876,constitutional thinness is an underweight state characterized by normal menstruations. removal of amenorrhea from the new definition of AN might result in misdiagnosis between these two populations.
Prior traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a TRACK-TBI cohort study.,"An estimated 14-23% of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) incur multiple lifetime TBIs. The relationship between prior TBI and outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) is not well delineated. We examined the associations between prior TBI, in-hospital mortality, and outcomes up to 12 months after injury in a prospective US msTBI cohort. Data from hospitalized subjects with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-12 were extracted from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Study (enrollment period: 2014-2019). Prior TBI with amnesia or alteration of consciousness was assessed using the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method. Competing risk regressions adjusting for age, sex, psychiatric history, cranial injury and extracranial injury severity examined the associations between prior TBI and in-hospital mortality, with hospital discharged alive as the competing risk. Adjusted HRs (aHR (95% CI)) were reported. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed the associations between prior TBI, mortality, and unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score 1-3 (vs. 4-8)) at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Of 405 acute msTBI subjects, 21.5% had prior TBI, which was associated with male sex (87.4% vs. 77.0%, p=0.037) and psychiatric history (34.5% vs. 20.7%, p=0.010). In-hospital mortality was 10.1% (prior TBI: 17.2%, no prior TBI: 8.2%, p=0.025). Competing risk regressions indicated that prior TBI was associated with likelihood of in-hospital mortality (aHR=2.06 (1.01-4.22)), but not with hospital discharged alive. Prior TBI was not associated with mortality or unfavorable outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months. After acute msTBI, prior TBI history is independently associated with in-hospital mortality but not with mortality or unfavorable outcomes within 12 months after injury. This selective association underscores the importance of collecting standardized prior TBI history data early after acute hospitalization to inform risk stratification.

Constraints and current practices of menstrual hygiene among Rohingya adolescent girls.,"Although half of Rohingya refugees are women and adolescent girls, the sexual and reproductive health issues of these vulnerable groups are still unexplored. The aim of this study was to review and describe menstrual hygiene management (MHM) along with the existing challenges of MHM among Rohingya adolescent girls. This concurrent mixed methods study was conducted among adolescents aged 13-18 years living in Kutupalong refugee camps in Ukhiya, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Camp-based surveys along with focus group discussions were performed for data collection. The findings of a total of 12 FGDs and 101 survey responses were included for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis, and thematic analysis was considered for the qualitative data. Approximately one-fourth of the adolescent girls (28.71%) had premenstrual knowledge. Only 8% had ""Good"" knowledge, and 12% had a basic understanding. Half of the women used cloths during menstruation, while others (20.79%) used homemade clean pads, disposable sanitary pads (17.82%), and used only underwear without absorbance (10.89%). The frequency of changing sanitary pads varied, but the majority of respondents (48.51%) changed padding at least once daily. Common disposal places were inside the toilet (30.69%), open spaces (17.82%), dustbins (6.93%) and water sources (3.96%). An inadequate and irregular supply of sanitary napkins or absorbents leads to poor MH practices. Limited cleaning and disposal facilities, lack of privacy in camps or informal settlements, confined and crowded places and nonsupportive environments in the camp were also factors affecting the use of pads and disposal. Family and cultural beliefs, stigma, restrictions, and fear of sexual violence were also noted within typical day-to-day activities during menstruation. The provision of adolescent-friendly wash facilities, appropriate information and adequate menstrual supplies is needed to improve the MH response in an emergency context. Despite some limitations, this study could lead to future changes relative to MH for women and adolescents in Rohingya.",['Pandit K; Hasan MJ; Islam T; Rakib TM'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35647348,half of refugees are women and adolescent girls. the sexual and reproductive health issues of these vulnerable groups are still unexplored.
DNA stable isotope probing reveals the impact of trophic interactions on bioaugmentation of soils with different pollution histories.,"Bioaugmentation is considered a sustainable and cost-effective methodology to recover contaminated environments, but its outcome is highly variable. Predation is a key top-down control mechanism affecting inoculum establishment, however, its effects on this process have received little attention. This study focused on the impact of trophic interactions on bioaugmentation success in two soils with different pollution exposure histories. We inoculated a <sup>13</sup>C-labelled pollutant-degrading consortium in these soils and tracked the fate of the labelled biomass through stable isotope probing (SIP) of DNA. We identified active bacterial and eukaryotic inoculum-biomass consumers through amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes coupled to a novel enrichment factor calculation. Inoculation effectively increased PAH removal in the short-term, but not in the long-term polluted soil. A decrease in the relative abundance of the inoculated genera was observed already on day 15 in the long-term polluted soil, while growth of these genera was observed in the short-term polluted soil, indicating establishment of the inoculum. In both soils, eukaryotic genera dominated as early incorporators of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled biomass, while bacteria incorporated the labelled biomass at the end of the incubation period, probably through cross-feeding. We also found different successional patterns between the two soils. In the short-term polluted soil, Cercozoa and Fungi genera predominated as early incorporators, whereas Ciliophora, Ochrophyta and Amoebozoa were the predominant genera in the long-term polluted soil. Our results showed differences in the inoculum establishment and predator community responses, affecting bioaugmentation efficiency. This highlights the need to further study predation effects on inoculum survival to increase the applicability of inoculation-based technologies.

"Is parental engagement associated with subsequent delayed marriage and marital choices of adolescent girls? Evidence from the Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) survey in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India.","This study examines the association between parental engagement and subsequent delayed marriage of adolescent girls and, secondarily, to assess whether parental engagement is positively associated with girls' involvement in marital decision-making regarding husband selection. The study used longitudinal survey data from the Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India. We analysed 6168 unmarried adolescent girls aged 15-19 years at wave 1 (2015-16) who were interviewed in wave 2 (2018-19). Our outcomes were delayed marriage of girls (unmarried vs. married at 20-22 vs. married at 18-19 vs. married at <18) and, among those married at <18 years, girls' involvement in husband selection (alone vs. with parents vs. not involved). Parental discussion around school performance, friendships, menstruation, pregnancy, free time, and personal issues were the exposure variables. We applied unadjusted and adjusted multinomial regression models to assess associations between our exposure variables and each outcome variable. From wave 1 to wave 2, 1551 girls (31.2%) married; 567 girls (12.5%) married as minors (<18 years). We found that parental discussion around school performance (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.33), friendship (RRR: 1.37) and personal matters (RRR: 1.29) were positively associated with remaining unmarried relative to early marriage of girls. However, discussion with parents about menstruation was negatively associated with marriage at 20-22 (RRR: 0.67) and remaining unmarried (RRR: 0.80), compared to early marriage. Discussing school performance was negatively associated with marriage at 18-19 (RRR: 0.62) and at 20-22 (RRR: 0.50), relative to early marriage. Discussing personal issues with parents was positively associated with joint parent-girl decision-making regarding husband selection, relative to parents alone selecting the husband (RRR: 1.43). Parental engagement on school performance, friendship, and personal issues in early adolescence may help delay marriage and support marital choice for girls in India.",['Paul P; Closson K; Raj A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37860704,"study examined association between parental engagement and subsequent delayed marriage of adolescent girls. study used longitudinal survey data from the Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) survey in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India."
Menstrual suppression in special circumstances.,"To provide a Canadian consensus document for health care providers with recommendations for menstrual suppression in patients with physical and/or cognitive challenges or those who are undergoing cancer treatment in whom menstruation may have a deleterious effect on their health. This document reviews the options available for menstrual suppression, its specific indications, contraindications, and side effects, both immediate and long-term, and the investigations and monitoring necessary throughout suppression. Clinicians will be better informed about the options and indications for menstrual suppression in patients with cognitive and/or physical disabilities and patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, or other treatments for cancer. Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline, EMBASE, OVID, and the Cochrane Library using appropriate controlled vocabulary and key words (heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual suppression, chemotherapy/radiation, cognitive disability, physical disability, learning disability). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, observation studies, and pilot studies. There were no language or date restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and new material was incorporated into the guideline until September 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). There is a need for specific guidelines on menstrual suppression in at-risk populations for health care providers. Recommendations 1. Menstrual suppression and therapeutic amenorrhea should be considered safe and viable options for women who need or want to have fewer or no menses. (II-2A) 2. Menstrual suppression should not be initiated in young women with developmental disabilities until after the onset of menses. (II-2B) 3. Combined hormonal or progesterone-only products can be used in an extended or continuous manner to obtain menstrual suppression. (I-A) 4. Gynaecologic consultation should be considered prior to the initiation of treatment in all premenopausal women at risk for abnormal uterine bleeding from chemotherapy. (II-1A) 5. Leuprolide acetate or combined hormonal contraception should be considered highly effective in preventing abnormal uterine bleeding when initiated prior to cancer treatment in premenopausal women at risk for thrombocytopenia.

Thermal tolerance of giant salmonfly nymphs (<i>Pteronarcys californica</i>) varies across populations in a regulated river.,"Warming of aquatic ecosystems is transforming the distribution, phenology and growth of the organisms dependent upon these ecosystems. Aquatic insects such as stoneflies are especially vulnerable to warming because the aquatic nymph stage of their life cycle depends on cool, well-oxygenated, flowing water habitat. We tracked thermal effects on available aerobic capacity of the aquatic nymph stage of an iconic and vulnerable stonefly species, the giant salmonfly (<i>Pteronarcys californica</i>), to compare habitat thermal regime measurements for two salmonfly populations from habitats separated by a gradient in summer weekly maximum temperatures. Contrary to expectations, the thermal optima range of the warmer habitat population was cooler than for the cooler habitat population. We posit that this unexpected interpopulation variation in thermal response is more strongly driven by diel and seasonal thermal variability than by the highest summer temperatures experienced within respective habitats. Additionally, we show that summer daily maximum temperatures could result in periodic limits in available aerobic capacity to support work of the warmer habitat nymphs and may be the mechanism underlying reduced abundance relative to the upstream cooler habitat population. Our findings provide insight into potential thermal and metabolic mechanisms that could regulate the success of ecological and culturally important aquatic insect species experiencing global change. We conclude that thermal regimes and thermal variation, not just mean and maximum temperatures, are critical drivers of aquatic insect responses to water temperatures.",['Verhille CE; MacDonald M; Noble B; Demorest G; Roche A; Frazier K; Albertson LK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38974500,"thermal tolerance of giant salmonfly nymphs varies across populations in a regulated river. aquatic insects such as stoneflies are especially vulnerable to warming. thermal tolerance of aquatic ecosystems is transforming distribution, phenology and growth of organisms dependent upon these ecosystems."
The experiences of menstrual symptom changes among international students studying in China during the acculturation period: A phenomenology study.,"Menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon among female which could be influenced by the process of acculturation. Few studies have explored the experience of menstrual symptom changes among international female students studying in China. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize international female students' experiences of menstrual symptom changes when they were studying in China and interpret these changes through considering the influence of acculturation on their social and academic lives. We used a descriptive phenomenology approach. Structured in-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted between May and November 2019 among ten international female students studying in one Province located in south central China. Participants were those who reported having experienced menstrual symptom changes during the acculturation period, which was defined as the first six months of living in China. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using NVivo 11.0 with the guidance of Colaizzi's seven-step method. The international female students' experiences of menstrual symptom changes were summarized and grouped into five main categories and 13 subcategories. The main categories include: 1) demonstration of menstrual symptom changes, 2) challenges of maintaining menstrual function in the new setting, 3) coping styles to take care of menstrual health, 4) consequences of the menstrual symptom changes, and 5) culture-based attitude toward menstruation. International female students reported experiences of menstrual symptom changes, including somatic and psychological symptoms during the acculturation period. Culture barriers, academic stress, and sleep patterns are common factors influencing their menstrual symptom changes. More culturally-tailored interventions should be explored to improve the menstrual health of international female students in China.",['Alkhatib A; Wu W; Alshikh Ahmad H; Pakwan Suwal R; Ni Z; Li X'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37128482,menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon among female. the study aims to summarize the experiences of menstrual symptom changes. participants were those who reported having experienced menstrual symptom changes during the acculturation period.
Does the interplay of emotion-related personality traits and reproductive hormones predict individual variation in emotion recognition?,"Person-related variation has been identified in many socio-cognitive domains, and there is evidence for links between certain personality traits and individual emotion recognition. Some studies, utilizing the menstrual cycle as a hormonal model, attempted to demonstrate that hormonal fluctuations could predict variations in emotion recognition, but with merely inconsistent findings. Remarkably, the interplay between hormone fluctuations and other person-related factors that could potentially influence emotion recognition remains understudied. In the current study, we examined if the interactions of emotion-related personality traits, namely openness, extraversion, and neuroticism, and the ovulatory cycle predict individual variation in facial emotion recognition in healthy naturally cycling women. We collected salivary ovarian hormones measures from N = 129 (n = 72 validated via LH test) women across their late follicular and mid-luteal phases of the ovulatory cycle. The results revealed a negative association between neuroticism scores and emotion recognition when progesterone levels (within-subject) were elevated. However, the results did not indicate a significant moderating influence of neuroticism, openness, and extraversion on emotion recognition across phases (late follicular vs. mid-luteal) of the menstrual cycle. Additionally, there was no significant interaction between openness or extraversion and ovarian hormone levels in predicting facial emotion recognition. The current study suggests future lines of research to compare these findings in a clinical setting, as both neuroticism and ovarian hormone dysregulation are associated with some psychiatric disorders such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).",['Rafiee Y; Heine C; Schacht A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38117736,ovulatory cycle and openness are linked to individual variation in emotion recognition. ovulatory cycle and follicular cycles are linked to individual variation. ovulatory cycle is a hormone model that can predict individual variation.
Fraction of cancers attributable to and prevented by reproductive factors and exogenous hormones use in Italy.,"Endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors have been associated with female breast, genital, and colorectal cancer risk. The aim of the present study is to conduct an evidence-based evaluation of the fraction of cancers attributable to and prevented by exogenous hormonal (i.e., combined oral contraceptives [COC] and combined estrogen-progestogen menopausal therapy [CEPMT]) and reproductive factors (i.e., parity and breastfeeding) in Italy. We calculated the population attributable and prevented fractions combining relative risks and prevalence of exposure in Italian women. Italian cancer incidence and mortality data were extracted from national sources and used to estimate the number of cancer cases and deaths attributable to reproductive factors and exogenous hormones in Italy in 2020. For long-term effects, a 20-year latency period was considered. COC were responsible for 4.4 % of breast and 10.9 % of cervical cancers in women aged 15-44, but also avoided 6.4 % of endometrial, 5.6 % of ovarian, and 2.9 % of colorectal cancers in women of all ages. Overall, COC use prevented 1174 cancer diagnoses and 577 cancer deaths. CEPMT caused 0.4 % of breast cancers at age 45-69. Low parity accounted for 8.1 %, 11.8 % and 15.5 % of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers, respectively (6267 cases, 1796 deaths). Breastfeeding avoided 6.4 % of breast cancers (3775 cases, 897 deaths). Our analysis quantified the complex effects of hormonal and reproductive factors on cancer burden in Italian women.",['Turati F; Collatuzzo G; Di Maso M; Negri E; Esposito G; Alicandro G; Malvezzi M; Pelucchi C; Boffetta P; La Vecchia C; Parazzini F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094535,"endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors have been associated with female breast, genital, and colorectal cancer risk. the aim of the present study is to conduct an evidence-based evaluation of the fraction of cancers attributable to and prevented by exogenous hormonal."
Reproductive Tract Microbiota of Mares.,"The female reproductive tract microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that might be crucial in maintaining a healthy reproductive environment. Imbalances in the bacterial community (dysbiosis) and the reduction of beneficial organisms and pathogen proliferation are associated with disease. Endometritis is a common cause of fertility problems in mares, and it is still challenging to diagnose and treat based on routine culture results of certain microorganisms. Although high-throughput sequencing studies provide helpful information regarding the composition of the reproductive tract microbiota in mares, there are still challenges in defining a ""normal"" microbiota. The primary objective of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge regarding the microbiota present in the reproductive tract of mares, including the vagina, cervix, and uterus. The second objective is to describe the relevant factors that can impact the reproductive microbiota of mares, including the estrous cycle stage, the type of species (genera) investigated, season, and geographic location. The rationality of identifying the normal microbiota in the reproductive tract of a mare will likely aid in understanding the impact of the microbiota on the host's reproductive health and contribute to the treatment and prevention of equine sub and infertility issues.",['Gil-Miranda A; Macnicol J; Orellana-Guerrero D; Samper JC; Gomez DE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058008,the reproductive tract microbiota of mares is a complex community of microorganisms. the microbiota is a common cause of fertility problems in mares. the bacterial community is associated with disease.
The Experience of Menarche for Young People With Sensory and Motor Impairments: A Systematic Review.,"Young people with disabilities may face barriers to optimal management of menstrual health, including the management of menarche, a unique stage of development. This systematic review examined the barriers to and facilitators of a positive experience of menarche for young people with visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. The MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO bibliographic databases, and grey literature were systematically searched in February 2022 to identify relevant research. Thematic synthesis of the extracted study findings was undertaken, using a team-based approach. A total of seven primary qualitative, and 1 mixed method studies were eligible for inclusion. The themes identified through metasynthesis were: timeliness of pre-menarcheal access, with many being unaware of menarche before it occurred, leading to fear and shock at their first period; resonance, with individuals reporting positive impacts of guidance from those with similar disabilities; and frame, the impact of surrounding societal narratives on the experience of menarche. Families, and those involved in the care of children with visual, hearing, and mobility impairments should be made aware of the importance of timely and resonant menarcheal support and guidance for these individuals and of broadcasting positive surrounding narratives of menarche. This should enable a positive experience of menarche for these vulnerable young people, supporting a good trajectory for later-life menstrual health.",['Schreiber T; Solebo AL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37815768,"systematic review examined barriers to and facilitators of a positive experience of menarche for young people with visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. the MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO bibliographic databases, and grey literature were systematically searched in February 2022."
Prevalence and Impact of Dysmenorrhoea among Omani High School Students.,"The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea in Omani high schoolgirls, its impact and the treatment used. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in May 2010 on 404 girls from two public high schools in the Muscat region. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire including information on demographics, prevalence of dysmenorrhoea, severity, its impact, and the treatment used. Overall, 94% (n = 380) of the participants had dysmenorrhoea. It was mild in 27% (n = 104), moderate in 41% (n = 155), and severe in 32% (n = 121). Dysmenorrhoea was the cause of limited sports activities in 81%, decreased class concentration in 75%, restricted homework in 59%, school absenteeism in 45%, limited social activities in 25%, and decreased academic performance in 8% of the affected students. Only 3% (n = 10) had consulted a physician; 21% (n = 80) self-medicated, and 55% (n = 210) took no action. The commonest drugs used were paracetamol (n = 60, 16%), ibuprofen (n = 29, 8%) and mefenemic acid (n = 12, 3%). There was no statistically significant correlation between dysmenorrhoea, demographics and menstrual characteristics. Dysmenorrhoea is a prevalent and yet undertreated menstrual disorder among Omani adolescent schoolgirls. The pain suffered can be severe and disabling. Doctors should therefore be prepared to discuss this more freely with schoolgirls. In addition, there is a need for education regarding dysmenorrhoea and treatment options to minimise the impact on school, sports, social and daily activities.",['Al-Kindi R; Al-Bulushi A'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22087397,"cross-sectional survey was carried out in may 2010 on 404 girls from two public high schools in the Muscat region. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea in Omani high schoolgirls, its impact and the treatment used."
Impact of a hypocaloric dietary intervention on antral follicle dynamics in eumenorrheic women with obesity.,"Do antral follicle dynamics change in women with obesity and regular ovulatory cycles after a 6-month hypocaloric dietary intervention? After a 6-month hypocaloric dietary intervention, women with obesity and regular ovulatory cycles displayed evidence of improved antral follicle dynamics defined by the emergence of more dominant follicles, larger ovulatory follicle diameter at selection, and increased luteal progesterone concentrations compared to pre-intervention. Precise events in antral folliculogenesis must occur in order for natural and regular monthly ovulation. In healthy women of reproductive age, antral follicles are recruited for growth in a wave-like fashion, wherein a subset of follicles are selected for preferential growth, and typically, one dominant follicle culminates in ovulation. Women with obesity and regular ovulatory cycles display evidence of suppressed antral follicle development, as evidenced by fewer recruitment events, fewer selectable and dominant follicles, smaller diameter of the ovulatory follicle at selection, and a higher prevalence of luteal phase defects. While improvements in gonadotropin and ovarian steroid hormone concentrations after weight loss have been documented in eumenorrheic women with obesity, the precise impact of weight loss on antral follicle dynamics has not been evaluated. A pre-post pilot study of 12 women who participated in a 6-month hypocaloric dietary intervention. Twelve women with obesity (total body fat ≥35%) underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and venipuncture every-other-day for one inter-ovulatory interval (IOI) both before (baseline) and during the final month (Month 7) of a six-month hypocaloric dietary intervention. Participants were aged 24-34 years and had a self-reported history of regular menstrual cycles (25-35 days). Follicle number and diameter (≥2 mm) were quantified at each study visit, and individual growth profiles for all follicles ≥7 mm were determined. Blood samples were assayed for reproductive hormones. Follicle dynamics and reproductive hormone concentrations were compared pre- and post-intervention. Further, post-intervention follicle and endocrine dynamics (Month 7 IOI) were compared to an age-matched reference cohort of lean women with regular ovulatory cycles (total body fat <35%, N = 21). Participants lost an average of 11% of their original body weight with the hypocaloric dietary intervention. More dominant follicles were detected (≥10 mm) at Month 7 compared to baseline (0. 3 ± 0.4 versus 0.4 ± 0.5 follicles, P = 0.001), and ovulatory follicles were selected at larger diameters post-intervention (7.3 ± 2.0 versus 10.9 ± 2.6 mm, P = 0.007). Luteal progesterone concentrations were increased at Month 7 compared to baseline (5.3 ± 3.65 versus 6.3 ± 4.74 ng/ml, P < 0.0001). However, risk for luteal phase dysfunction as judged by the prevalence of a luteal phase length <10 days, integrated luteal progesterone levels <80 ng/ml or peak progesterone <10 ng/ml did not differ pre- versus post-intervention (all, P > 0.05). In Month 7, follicle dynamics and endocrine profiles were similar to the reference cohort across all measures. This study does not inform on the earliest stages of ovarian follicle development and is limited to providing knowledge on the later stages of antral follicle development. This study cannot fully address causation between weight loss and sustained improvements in antral follicle dynamics. The data cannot be extrapolated to comment on potential improvements in fertility and fecundity with weight loss. The small group sizes limit statistical power. The increasing prevalence of obesity necessitates an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie potential improvements in reproductive health outcomes with weight loss. Women with obesity and regular ovulatory cycles who undertook a 6-month hypocaloric dietary intervention demonstrated improvements consistent with benefits of lifestyle intervention on reproductive health even in those without overt signs of reproductive dysfunction. Potential improvements in the cellular makeup of follicles, which may underlie the restoration of normal follicle development and amelioration of subfertility, require further investigation.

The impact of embedment of the side arms of 52 mg levonorgestrel-intrauterine device on bleeding and pain: A prospective cohort study.,"The purpose of this study was to analyse the impact of embedment of side arms of the levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) in the myometrium (assessed by three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3D-TVUS)) on uterine bleeding and pain. We performed a prospective cohort study in a large Dutch teaching hospital between February 2015 and December 2016. Participants over 18 years of age who selected a LNG-IUD for contraception or because of heavy menstrual bleeding were eligible for inclusion. Six weeks after insertion, a 3D-TVUS was performed to diagnose embedment of the side arms. At that moment participants filled in questionnaires about their bleeding pattern and pelvic pain. Menstruation patterns 'no bleeding', 'regular menstruation', 'sometimes a day of spotting (maximum once a week)' were classified as favourable bleeding pattern. Menstruation patterns 'heavy menstrual bleeding', 'several days a week bleeding days', 'several days a week spotting days', 'continuously spotting', and 'completely irregular cycle' were classified as unfavourable bleeding pattern. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 %-confidence intervals (CI). The multivariate analysis included endometrial thickness, reason for insertion and parity. The analysis of pelvic pain additionally included previous insertion. A total of 220 participants were evaluated for the study of whom 176 returned the questionnaires. Embedment of the side arms was observed in 43 of the 176 responding participants (24.4 %). Favourable bleeding pattern was reported by 25/43 (58.1 %) participants with embedment and 53/133 (39.8 %) participants without embedment (ORadj 1.8, 95 % CI 0.9-3.9). Pelvic pain was reported by 4/43 (9.3 %) participants with embedment and 24/133 (18.1 %) participants without embedment (ORadj 0.3; CI 0.1-1.2). The present study suggests that embedment of the side arms of the LNG-IUD in the myometrium assessed by 3D-TVUS is not associated with a unfavourable bleeding pattern nor pelvic pain six weeks after insertion. From this point of view, we do not recommend to perform standard 3D-TVUS for the purpose of excluding or demonstrating embedment.",['van der Heijden PAHH; Bongers MY; Veersema S; Dieleman JP; Geomini PMAJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38531476,"prospective cohort study was conducted in a large Dutch teaching hospital. participants over 18 years who selected a LNG-IUD for contraception were eligible for inclusion. menstruation patterns 'no bleeding','regular menstruation','sometimes a day of spotting' were classified as unfavourable bleeding pattern."
Sexual health literacy among rural women in Southern Iran.,"Sexual health literacy (SHL) is a set of skills related to sexual behaviors that can affect sexual behavior and empower individuals to maintain as well as improve their sexual health. This study aimed to investigate the rural women's sexual health literacy and its related factors in Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 married women of reproductive ages referring to health center in Benaroyeh region along with six sub-villages in the South of Fars, Iran. Using convenience sampling method, we collected data via demographic-reproductive characteristics questionnaire and sexual health literacy for adult's questionnaire. We analyzed data using SPSS-16. Approximately 33.5% of the women obtained their sexual information online. The mean total SHL score was 75.64 ± 12.81. The SHL level was considered desirable in 82.5% of the participants. Among the four domains of SHL, the scores of most subjects on access skills and analysis-evaluation skills were unfavorable, 24.5% and 35.5%, respectively. The results show that the SHL level was correlated with education (P = 0.021) and inversely related to the gravidity (P = 0.04). There was also a statistically significant relationship between SHL level and women's career (P = 0.026), spouse's career (P = 0.01), and parity (P = 0.05). Most rural women had desirable levels of SHL. Given the lower levels of SHL in access and analysis-evaluation skills, and given the prevalence of Internet use, the provision of high quality and accessible online sexual health content within social and cultural norms is recommended.",['Bahrampour B; Shahali S; Lamyian M; Rasekhi A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075136,rural women in southern Iran have desirable levels of sexual health literacy. the study aims to investigate the rural women's sexual health literacy.
Association of intrauterine synechiae with pituitary gonadotrophin pulse patterns: A pilot study.,"Intrauterine synechiae (IS) is an acquired uterine condition that occurs when scar tissues (adhesions) form within the uterus and/or cervix, causing menstrual disturbance. However, approximately 50% of patients with IS are refractory to treatment. Therefore, other endocrine disturbances, such as gonadotropin disturbance, may affect treatment success. To analyze gonadotropin levels in women with and without IS. Ten women with refractory IS experiencing amenorrhea since at least 6 months and nine with normal menstrual cycles (control group) were included in this study. Blood sample were collected every 10 minutes during a 4-h period. The serial ultrasound was performed in both groups for evaluating the cycle phase. Blood was collected when the follicles size was between 5-10 mm. Serum LH, FSH, progesterone and estradiol concentrations were measured. To detect LH and FSH pulses, the technique proposed by Santen and Bardin was adopted; therefore, one pulse was defined as a 20% increase in the concentrations as to the preceding point, followed by an important decrease. No differences were observed between the study groups at baseline. Estradiol levels were lower in the IS group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. During the first hour of monitoring, cumulative FSH pulsatile frequency of IS group was lower than one of control. Our data suggest that the estradiol levels of IS participants are lower than those of women with normal menstrual cycle. The role of this finding in the physiology of uterine synechiae requires further investigation.",['Gianfaldoni A; Roa C; Dos Santos Simões R; Baracat MCP; Maggio da Fonseca A; Bagnoli VR; Sopreso ICE; Silva Rivas FW; Monteleone P; Baracat EC; Soares Júnior JM'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38100407,"intrauterine synechiae (IS) is an acquired uterine condition that occurs when scar tissue (adhesions) form within the uterus and/or cervix, causing menstrual disturbance. approximately 50% of patients with IS are refractory to treatment."
Post-treatment anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels predict long-term ovarian dysfunction in women with hematological malignancies.,"Fertility is a concern in young female survivors of hematological malignancies. We evaluated post-treatment ovarian function in patients by measuring anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and conventional hormone levels to correlate with menstruation and fertility.The prospective cohort study included 29 reproductive-aged women diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (<i>n</i> = 11), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<i>n</i> = 9) or acute myeloid leukemia (<i>n</i> = 9). Hormone assays were measured after treatment was completed and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Menstrual changes and postmenopausal symptoms were assessed annually.Serum AMH levels were significantly lower compared to controls at 12 months after treatment [1.0 (0.18-1.8) vs. 2.2 (1.8-4.8) ng/mL; <i>P </i>< .001). At 12 months, FSH and LH levels were significantly higher compared to controls. The interruption of menstrual cycles was observed in 80% (22/27) of patients. Normal menstruation returned at a median of 1.5 months after cessation of treatment in 71% of patients, while 29% of patients had persistent amenorrhea. Low AMH levels at 12 months after therapy (<1 ng/mL) correlated more strongly with abnormal menstrual cycles than normal AMH levels (46% vs. 0%<i>, P </i>= .04). Four patients with low AMH consulted an infertility clinic.In summary, low serum AMH at 12 months after chemotherapy was associated with persistent menstrual abnormalities.",['Kongkiatkamon S; Chintabanyat A; Polprasert C; Uaprasert N; Rojnuckarin P'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35068389,"post-treatment anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels predict long-term ovarian dysfunction in women with hematological malignancies. the prospective cohort study included 29 reproductive-aged women diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (i>n/i> = 11), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (i>n/i> = 9) or acute myeloid leukemia (i>n/i> = 9)."
[Construction and application of a risk index of <i>Echinococcus</i> infection based on the classification of echinococcosis lesions].,"To investigate the feasibility of constructing the risk index of <i>Echinococcus</i> infection based on the classification of echinococcosis lesions, so as to provide insights into the management of echinococcosis. The imaging data of echinococcosis cases were collected from epidemiological surveys of echinococcosis in China from 2012 to 2016, and the detection of incident echinococcosis cases was captured from the annual echinococcosis prevention and control reports across provinces (autonomous regions) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in China from 2017 to 2022. After echinococcosis lesions were classified, a risk index of <i>Echinococcus</i> infection was constructed based on the principle of discrete distribution marginal probability and multi-group classification data tests.

Assessment of premature menopause on the sexual function and quality of life in women.,"Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is characterized by ending menstruation in women under 40 years of age. It has a significant effect on women's sexuality and mental health and quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the sexual function and quality of life of premature menopausal women. This study was a case-control study on 132 people (66 women with a diagnosis of POF and 66 women of reproductive age with normal ovarian function) who were matched in terms of the age, presenting to Women's Clinic in Jahrom in 2019. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire were used to collect data. <i>p</i> < .05 was considered statistically significant. The mean score of sexual function in premature menopausal women was 21.35 ± 4.82 and in non-menopausal women was 25.4 ± 6.61 (OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.04-0.28).

Social impact of menstrual problems among adolescent school girls in rural Tamil Nadu.,"Background Adolescence is a period of physiological, psychological and social transition between childhood and adulthood and is characterized by the onset of menstruation in girls. A adolescent girls are naïve about menstruation and they take time to adapt to these changes both socially and psychologically. This study was carried out to assess the psychosocial impact of menstrual problems among schoolgoing adolescent girls. Methods This study is a cross-sectional study carried out in 350 schoolgoing adolescent girls in the year 2012 in the Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu. Girls who attained menarche 1 year prior to the data collection were included in the study. Data regarding background characteristics and psychosocial impact of menstrual problems were collected. Data was analyzed using SPSS ver. 15 software. The χ2-test was carried out to assess the statistical significance at the 95% level of significance. Results The mean age of the participants was 14.7 years. In this study, 87.7% of the girls had at least one menstrual problem. Among these, 78.5% could not attend school during menstruation, 51.1% were unable to perform household/sports activities (p < 0.001). It was observed that dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia were at increased risk of absenting the girls from school (p < 0.05). Conclusion The key to a sound adolescent health programme is a holistic approach which also focuses on the psychological and social domain of health. This could be achieved by involving all the stakeholders like parents, teachers, etc. to work as a team.

Effect of Video Modeling With Simulation on Improving Menstrual Hygiene Skills for Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Background Menstruation is a biological process experienced by women every month. This project intends to improve menstrual hygiene skills using video modeling with simulation. Educating adolescent girls with autism spectrum disorder to engage in personal care during their menstrual cycle, particularly sanitation and hygiene, is essential. It is important to develop the knowledge and skills necessary for effective self-care during menstruation to prevent sexual health problems. Additionally, the project aims to provide a safe environment for adolescents to practice their menstrual hygiene routines and relieve the stress from their caregivers. Aim and objective The study aims to evaluate the effect of video modeling with simulation to improve menstrual hygiene skills in adolescents with autism. The ultimate objective of the study is to determine whether video modeling with simulation in the experimental group enhances the practice of menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls with autism, as well as the impact of traditional occupational therapy intervention on improving menstrual hygiene in this population. Methodology This is a quasi-experimental design with convenience sampling and selected samples (n=50), who were then split into two groups: an experimental group (n=25) and a control group (n=25) based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The experimental group received video modeling and simulation, while the control group did not receive any specific intervention except parent education and pictorial representations. Pre- and post-tests were conducted to measure the changes. Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism was the screening tool used and the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MNPS) was administered. The duration of the study was six months, three sessions per week, lasting 45 minutes to an hour each. The statistical analysis was done with significance at a 1% alpha level using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The pre-test and post-test data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney test. The results demonstrated the comparison of the pre-test and post-test mean scores of the MNPS scores were highly statistically significant (p-value of 0.000) when compared to the control group. Following the implementation of video modeling with simulation, the experimental group's post-test scores were significantly higher than the control group's (p-value of 0.000). Thus, the study showed that video modeling with simulation improved menstrual hygiene in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. Conclusion The clinical significance of this study was that the adolescents were excited to watch the videos and perform the activities; furthermore, after video modeling with simulation was implemented, there was a significant improvement in the experimental group when compared to the control group. This enhances the practice of the menstrual hygiene skills independently by the adolescents. Video modeling with simulation has paved the way for improving menstrual hygiene in adolescents with autism. Although the findings from the study are positive, more clinical trials are needed to prove that video modeling with simulation can be used as a therapeutic modality.",['Kumar MA; N S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39040730,"study aims to evaluate the effect of video modeling with simulation on menstrual hygiene skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. the experimental group received video modeling and simulation, while the control group did not receive specific intervention except parent education and pictorial representations."
Experiences of dysmenorrhea and its treatment among allistic and autistic menstruators: a thematic analysis.,"Dysmenorrhea (i.e., period pain) is common and debilitating. Autistic people are known to experience pain differently, yet little is known about the menstrual pain experiences of autistic menstruators relative to non-autistic peers. This study aimed to explore the experience of period pain and treatment uptake for period pain among allistic and autistic populations. This study used a qualitative design and opportunity sampling approach. Thirty-seven participants (of whom 17 were autistic) were interviewed via video-conferencing software using a semi-structured topic guide. Transcriptions of interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Data were initially analysed together for common themes. Autistic menstruators' data was subsequently analysed separately to elucidate the unique experiences of this group. A total of six themes were constructed from the data. Initial analysis determined three themes related to experiences of period pain and treatment uptake in both allistic and autistic menstruators. Social perception of menstruation was discussed, highlighting the normalisation of pain, the taboo nature, and gendered experience of menstruation, contributing to untreated menstrual pain. Issues within menstrual healthcare were also shared, including experiences of ineffective treatment, dismissive interactions, and insufficient menstrual education. Impaired functionality was repeatedly highlighted, with menstruators detailing significant limitations to their usual functioning due to menstrual pain and ineffective treatment. Three further themes were constructed from separate analysis of data from autistic menstruators. Autistic menstruators discussed the impact of menstruation on their sensory experiences and needs, with many identifying overstimulation during menstruation. Social exclusion was discussed as a factor contributing to the experience of menstrual pain and poor treatment uptake. The final theme identified pain communication differences between autistic and allistic menstruators resulting in reports of ineffective treatment and challenges in healthcare interactions. Communication differences, sensory aspects, and social factors contributed to the experience of period pain and treatment uptake for autistic menstruators. The perception of menstruation within society was highlighted by allistic and autistic menstruators as influential to their pain experience and engagement with treatment. Functionality was significantly impacted by pain for this sample. The study highlights societal and healthcare factors that could be improved to ensure accessibility of support and treatment for menstrual issues.",['Gray LJ; Durand H'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37231369,autistic menstruators are known to experience pain differently. but little is known about the menstrual pain experiences of autistic menstruators.
Migraine prodromes and migraine triggers.,"Migraine is characterized by a well-defined premonitory phase occurring hours or even days before the headache. Also, many migraineurs report typical triggers for their headaches. Triggers, however, are not consistent in their ability to precipitate migraine headaches. When looking at the clinical characteristics of both premonitory symptoms and triggers, a shared pathophysiological basis seems evident. Both seem to have their origin in basic homeostatic networks such as the feeding/fasting, the sleeping/waking, and the stress response network, all of which strongly rely on the hypothalamus as a hub of integration and are densely interconnected. They also influence the trigeminal pain processing system. Additionally, thalamic and hormonal mechanisms are involved. Activity within all those networks is influenced by various endogenous and external factors and might even cyclically change dependent on physiological internal rhythms. This might affect the threshold for the generation of migraine headaches. Premonitory symptoms thus appear as the result of an already ongoing alteration within those networks, whereas triggers might in this special situation only be able to further stress the system over the threshold for attack generation as catalysts of a process already in motion.",['Fischer-Schulte LH; Peng KP'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043958,migraineurs report typical triggers for their headaches. both seem to have their origin in basic homeostatic networks. they influence the trigeminal pain processing system.

Predicting adverse birth outcome among childbearing women in Sub-Saharan Africa: employing innovative machine learning techniques.,"Adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth, remain a major global health challenge, particularly in developing regions. Understanding the possible risk factors is crucial for designing effective interventions for birth outcomes. Accordingly, this study aimed to develop a predictive model for adverse birth outcomes among childbearing women in Sub-Saharan Africa using advanced machine learning techniques. Additionally, this study aimed to employ a novel data science interpretability techniques to identify the key risk factors and quantify the impact of each feature on the model prediction. The study population involved women of childbearing age from 26 Sub-Saharan African countries who had given birth within five years before the data collection, totaling 139,659 participants. Our data source was a recent Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We utilized various data balancing techniques. Ten advanced machine learning algorithms were employed, with the dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Model evaluation was conducted using various performance metrics, along with hyperparameter optimization. Association rule mining and SHAP analysis were employed to enhance model interpretability. Based on our findings, about 28.59% (95% CI: 28.36, 28.83) of childbearing women in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced adverse birth outcomes. After repeated experimentation and evaluation, the random forest model emerged as the top-performing machine learning algorithm, with an AUC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 88.0%. The key risk factors identified were home deliveries, lack of prenatal iron supplementation, fewer than four antenatal care (ANC) visits, short and long delivery intervals, unwanted pregnancy, primiparous mothers, and geographic location in the West African region. The region continues to face persistent adverse birth outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for increased attention and action. Encouragingly, advanced machine learning methods, particularly the random forest algorithm, have uncovered crucial insights that can guide targeted actions. Specifically, the analysis identifies risky groups, including first-time mothers, women with short or long birth intervals, and those with unwanted pregnancies. To address the needs of these high-risk women, the researchers recommend immediately providing iron supplements, scheduling comprehensive prenatal care, and strongly encouraging facility-based deliveries or skilled birth attendance.",['Ngusie HS; Mengiste SA; Zemariam AB; Molla B; Tesfa GA; Seboka BT; Alene TD; Sun J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075434,"study aimed to develop a predictive model for adverse birth outcomes. key risk factors identified were preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth."
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cause of physical, psychological and social problems in women of reproductive age. The key characteristic of PMS is the timing of symptoms, which occur only during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as first line therapy for PMS. SSRIs can be taken either in the luteal phase or else continuously (every day). SSRIs are generally considered to be effective for reducing premenstrual symptoms but they can cause adverse effects. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for treating premenstrual syndrome. Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (February 2013). Where insufficient data were presented in a report, attempts were made to contact the original authors for further details. Studies were considered in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LPDD) were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data on premenstrual symptoms and adverse effects. Studies were pooled using random-effects models. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for premenstrual symptom scores, using separate analyses for different types of continuous data (that is end scores and change scores). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Analyses were stratified by type of drug administration (luteal or continuous) and by drug dose (low, medium, or high). We calculated the number of women who would need to be taking a moderate dose of SSRI in order to cause one additional adverse event (number needed to harm: NNH). The overall quality of the evidence for the main findings was assessed using the GRADE working group methods. Thirty-one RCTs were included in the review. They compared fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram versus placebo. SSRIs reduced overall self-rated symptoms significantly more effectively than placebo. The effect size was moderate when studies reporting end scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84, nine studies, 1276 women; moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 58%), low quality evidence). The effect size was small when studies reporting change scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.51, four studies, 657 women; low heterogeneity (I(2)=29%), moderate quality evidence).SSRIs were effective for symptom relief whether taken only in the luteal phase or continuously, with no clear evidence of a difference in effectiveness between these modes of administration. However, few studies directly compared luteal and continuous regimens and more evidence is needed on this question.Withdrawals due to adverse effects were significantly more likely to occur in the SSRI group (moderate dose: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.53, 15 studies, 2447 women; no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%), moderate quality evidence). The most common side effects associated with a moderate dose of SSRIs were nausea (NNH = 7), asthenia or decreased energy (NNH = 9), somnolence (NNH = 13), fatigue (NNH = 14), decreased libido (NNH = 14) and sweating (NNH = 14). In secondary analyses, SSRIs were effective for treating specific types of symptoms (that is psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). Adverse effects were dose-related.The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate, the main weakness in the included studies being poor reporting of methods. Heterogeneity was low or absent for most outcomes, though (as noted above) there was moderate heterogeneity for one of the primary analyses. SSRIs are effective in reducing the symptoms of PMS, whether taken in the luteal phase only or continuously. Adverse effects are relatively frequent, the most common being nausea and asthenia. Adverse effects are dose-dependent.","[""Marjoribanks J; Brown J; O'Brien PM; Wyatt K""]",2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23744611,"premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common cause of physical, psychological and social problems in women of reproductive age. the key characteristic of PMS is the timing of symptoms, which occur only during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle) SSRIs can be taken either in the luteal phase or else continuously (every day)"
Diagnosis and management of uterine fibroids: current trends and future strategies.,"Uterine fibroids (UFs), leiomyomas or myomas, are a type of malignancy that affects the smooth muscle of the uterus, and it is most commonly detected in women of reproductive age. Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal growths that emerge from uterine smooth muscle cells (myometrium) as well as fibroblasts. Uterine fibroid symptoms include abnormal menstrual bleeding leading to anaemia, tiredness, chronic vaginal discharge, and pain during periods. Other symptoms include protrusion of the abdomen, pain during intercourse, dysfunctions of bladder/bowel leading to urinary incontinence/retention, pain, and constipation. It is also associated with reproductive issues like impaired fertility, conceiving complications, and adverse obstetric outcomes. It is the leading cause of gynaecological hospitalisation in the American subcontinent and a common reason for the hysterectomy. Twenty-five percent of the reproductive women experience the symptoms of uterine fibroids, and among them, around 25% require hospitalization due to the severity of the disease. The frequency of the disease remains underestimated as many women stay asymptomatic and symptoms appear gradually; therefore, the condition remains undiagnosed. The exact frequency of uterine fibroids varies depending on the diagnosis, and the population investigated; nonetheless, the incidence of uterine fibroids in reproductive women ranges from 5.4 percent to 77 percent. The uterine fibroid treatment included painkillers, supplementation with iron, vitamin D3, birth control, hormone therapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, drugs modulating the estrogen receptors, and surgical removal of the fibroids. However, more research needed at the level of gene to get a keen insight and treat the disease efficiently.",['Ahmad A; Kumar M; Bhoi NR; Akhtar J; Khan MI; Ajmal M; Ahmad M'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36989026,uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal growths that emerge from uterine smooth muscle cells. they are most commonly detected in women of reproductive age. it is the leading cause of gynaecological hospitalisation in the american subcontinent.
The effect of soil parameters and earthworm abundance on the fine-scale nocturnal habitat use of the Eurasian woodcock (<i>Scolopax rusticola</i>).,"The Eurasian woodcock prefers habitats where its main prey, earthworms, can be found in higher densities. Although they are forest-dwelling birds, they regularly visit pastures and natural grasslands at night, where earthworm abundance is generally higher. However, there is little information on fine-scale habitat use in relation to variation in habitat characteristics and prey availability, particularly beyond the breeding season. In our study, we investigated if the nocturnal occurrence of woodcocks during migratory stopover periods differed between two neighbouring fields, or management units, with similar vegetation structure, and if within-field variation in the spatial patterns of woodcock sightings were associated with fine-scale earthworm densities and soil parameters. Specifically, we used GPS tracking data of two tagged woodcocks and direct observation data to study patterns of occurrence of birds in a mixed forest-pasture landscape in Hungary during pre- and post-breeding periods. We compared these patterns with fine-scale soil characteristics and earthworm abundance, acquired by field sampling. We found that the field with higher earthworm abundance was visited by woodcocks more frequently, and this correlation was similarly observed at the intra-field level. Our results demonstrate that woodcocks select foraging sites with higher earthworm densities at multiple spatial scales, both between fields (coarse scale), and within fields (fine-scale). Considering that woodcocks tended to return to the same field to forage at night, the strong associations between occupancy and resources provide a basis for developing habitat management strategies at the field level for conservation. As earthworm densities and soil parameters are good indicators of woodcock foraging habitat, measuring those variables, at least at a coarse scale, could aid in predicting important habitats for the species across the landscape.",['Schally G; Tóth D; Márton M; Bijl H; Palatitz P; Csányi S; Maimela Modiba M; Tharwat Mohamed Ibrahim H; Simon B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39108567,"the Eurasian woodcock prefers habitats where its main prey, earthworms, can be found in higher densities. the birds regularly visit pastures and natural grasslands at night, where earthworm abundance is generally higher. however, there is little information on fine-scale habitat use in relation to variation in habitat characteristics and prey availability."
Neuroactive steroid hormone trajectories across the menstrual cycle in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): the PHASE study.,"It is presently not known whether endogenous neuroactive steroid hormone trajectories across the menstrual cycle are distinguishable in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). To improve the rigor in this area of research, we implemented a validated study methodology, involving blood sample collection at 8 key menstrual cycle timepoints, following which the study data is realigned so that all women are compared at the same biological window (i.e., menstrual cycle subphase). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we analyzed serum levels of nine steroid hormones previously implicated in the etiology of PMDD, including allopregnanolone. Other than progesterone (p ≤ 0.001), none of the steroid hormones displayed significant changes across menstrual cycle subphases when comparing participants with PMDD to the healthy controls. A thorough investigation of the progesterone trajectory showed that its left shift in the luteal phase (e.g., earlier rise in progesterone) exposes women with PMDD to a higher periovulatory progesterone and a more acute withdrawal in the late luteal subphase. Results of the present study indicate that the largely overlooked brief periovulatory subphase should be thoroughly examined in PMDD and agree with prior conclusions that rapid progesterone withdrawal associates with the development of negative affect.",['Hamidovic A; Mumford S; Schisterman E; Davis J; Soumare F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38664491,a validated study methodology was implemented to improve the rigor in this area of research. it is not known whether endogenous neuroactive steroid hormone trajectories across the menstrual cycle are distinguishable in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)
Different fluorescent labels report distinct components of spHCN channel voltage sensor movement.,"We used voltage clamp fluorometry to probe the movement of the S4 helix in the voltage-sensing domain of the sea urchin HCN channel (spHCN) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We obtained markedly different fluorescence responses with either ALEXA-488 or MTS-TAMRA covalently linked to N-terminal Cys332 of the S4 helix. With hyperpolarizing steps, ALEXA-488 fluorescence increased rapidly, consistent with it reporting the initial inward movement of S4, as previously described. In contrast, MTS-TAMRA fluorescence increased more slowly and its early phase correlated with that of channel opening. Additionally, a slow fluorescence component that tracked the development of the mode shift, or channel hysteresis, could be resolved with both labels. We quantitated this component as an increased deactivation tail current delay with concomitantly longer activation periods and found it to depend strongly on the presence of K+ ions in the pore. Using collisional quenching experiments and structural predictions, we established that ALEXA-488 was more exposed to solvent than MTS-TAMRA. We propose that components of S4 movement during channel activation can be kinetically resolved using different fluorescent probes to reveal distinct biophysical properties. Our findings underscore the need to apply caution when interpreting voltage clamp fluorometry data and demonstrate the potential utility of different labels to interrogate distinct biophysical properties of voltage-gated membrane proteins.",['Wojciechowski MN; McKenzie CE; Hung A; Kuanyshbek A; Soh MS; Reid CA; Forster IC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38968404,"different fluorescent labels report distinct components of spHCN channel voltage sensor movement. voltage clamp fluorometry probes were used to probe the movement of the s4 helix.

Females translate male mRNA transferred during mating.,"Although RNA is found in the seminal fluid of diverse organisms, it is unknown whether it is functional within females. We developed a proteomic method (VESPA, Variant Enabled SILAC Proteomic Analysis) to test the hypothesis that <i>Drosophila</i> male seminal fluid RNA is translated by females. We found 67 male-derived, female-translated proteins (mdFTPs) in female lower reproductive tracts, many with predicted functions relevant to reproduction. Knockout experiments indicate that mdFTPs play diverse roles in postmating interactions, affecting fertilization success, and the formation/persistence of the insemination reaction mass, a trait hypothesized to be involved in sexual conflict. These findings advance our understanding of reproduction by revealing a mechanism of postmating molecular interactions between the sexes that strengthens and extends male influences on reproduction in previously unrecognized ways. Given the diverse species that carry RNA in seminal fluid, this discovery has broad significance for understanding molecular mechanisms of cooperation and conflict during reproduction.",['Matzkin LM; Bono JM; Pigage HK; Allan CW; Diaz F; McCoy JR; Green CC; Callan JB; Delahunt SP'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39108707,"mdFTPs play roles in postmating interactions, affecting fertilization success, and the formation/persistence of the insemination reaction mass. mdFTPs are believed to be involved in sexual conflict."
"Impact of health education intervention on menstruation and its hygiene among urban school-going adolescent girls in Thiruvallur, Tamilnadu.","Adolescent girls require specific and special attention since they are the most vulnerable group not only in terms of their social status but also their health. Poor menstrual hygiene can lead to developing infections and other complications. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of assessing the impact of health education on menstrual hygiene among urban school-going adolescent girls. A quasi-experimental, pre and post-test study was conducted among adolescent girls aged between 11 to 17 years from two public schools in the urban field practice area of tertiary care medical college in Thiruvallur district of Tamilnadu. A pre-interventional survey was done using a pretested validated questionnaire. Multipronged health education intervention was administered, and its effectiveness was measured after four months using the same tool. Frequencies, percentages, median, and range were used to describe variables. 'Wilcoxon signed-rank test' and the ""Mann-Whitney U-"" test were used for inferential statistics. There was a statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) improvement in the knowledge of menstruation, perceived attitude, and practice of good menstrual hygiene from pre to post-test after the intervention. Demographic factors such as age, mother's education, and socio-economic status, and Menstrual characteristics such as age at menarche, regular menstrual flow, absence of dysmenorrhea, and getting menstruation advice before menarche were found to be significantly associated with the post-test median scores. A planned and structured health education program should be addressed to adolescent girls both at schools and community settings for improving menstruation-related knowledge and practices.",['Parasuraman G; Vijay V; Balaji S; Nisha B; Dutta R; Jain T; Eshwar PA'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36505589,"health education intervention was administered in adolescent girls aged 11-17. the study was conducted in Thiruvallur, Tamilnadu."
Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination on Menstrual Cycle: An Italian Survey-Based Study.,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has played a critical role in controlling the spread of the pandemic. The main side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination include fever and fatigue; however, the potential impacts on menstrual cycles are to be determined. Given the limited number of studies suggesting menstrual changes post vaccination, this study investigates the correlation between COVID-19 vaccines and menstrual cycle changes in fertile-aged Italian women. A questionnaire was distributed from 1 October to 31 November 2022, focusing on menstrual rhythm and flow changes post vaccination. The analysis involved 471 participants. The study observed a shift from a regular to an irregular menstrual rhythm (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and changes in menstrual duration (<i>p</i> = 0.008 and <i>p</i> < 0.001 for first and second doses, respectively) and flow volume (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Most patients with irregular rhythms were vaccinated in the proliferative phase of their cycle. Within six months post vaccination, 74.2% of women with irregular post-vaccination rhythms reported a return to normality. These findings indicate primarily transient menstrual changes following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, suggesting the vaccines' safety for women of reproductive age.",['Granese R; Incognito GG; Gulino FA; Casiraro G; Porcaro P; Alibrandi A; Martinelli C; Ercoli A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38137768,a questionnaire was distributed from 1 October to 31 November 2022. it examined the correlation between COVID-19 and menstrual cycle changes. the study observed a shift from a regular to an irregular menstrual rhythm.
"""He'll come with some sugar."" A qualitative study exploring the drivers and consequences of schoolgirls transactional sex behaviours.","Transactional sex (TS) is common in areas of sub-Saharan Africa, motivated by reasons beyond financial support. Through this qualitative study we sought to understand the motivation driving TS among adolescent schoolgirls in rural western Kenya where rates are reportedly high. Identifying and understanding drivers within the local context is necessary for implementation of successful public health policy and programming to reduce the associated harms impacting health and wellbeing. To understand the drivers of sexual behaviors, individual views, and socio-cultural norms, we spoke with schoolgirls, male peers, parents and teachers. The three latter groups may influence, encourage, and shape girls' views and behaviors and thus contribute to the perpetuation of cultural and societal norms. One hundred and ninety-nine participants took part across 20 FGDs; 8 comprised of schoolgirl groups, and 4 each of schoolboy, parent or teacher groups. Through thematic analysis, poverty emerged as the key driver of TS and a normative behaviour amongst secondary school girls. Subthemes including parental influence, need for menstrual pads, pressure from boda boda drivers, peer pressure, and blame were part of a complex relationship linking poverty with TS. We conclude that whilst TS is perceived as inevitable, normal and acceptable it is not really a choice for many girls. Exploring ways to encourage communication between families, including around menstruation, may help enable girls to ask for help in acquiring essential items. In addition, education at a community level may shift social norms over time and decrease the prevalence of age-disparate TS among schoolgirls and older, wealthier men in the community.",['Thiaw Y; Nyothach E; Zulaika G; van Eijk AM; Fwaya E; Obor D; Phillips-Howard P; Mason L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38800526,"a qualitative study explores the drivers and consequences of schoolgirls transactional sex behaviours. the study was conducted in rural western Kenya where rates are high. the study was conducted by adolescent schoolgirls, male peers, parents and teachers."
Nutritional practices to manage menstrual cycle related symptoms: a systematic review.,"Certain nutritional practices may reduce menstrual-related symptoms, but there is no current consensus on what foods/supplements are sufficiently evidenced to warrant promotion to reduce menstrual symptoms of naturally menstruating individuals. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two online databases were searched for published experimental studies that investigated the effects of foods/supplements on menstrual-related symptoms in eumenorrhoeic women. Extracted data and study characteristics were tabulated and grouped on the basis of food/supplement intervention and dosage compared with UK dietary reference values (DRV) and safe upper limits. In total, twenty-eight studies and twenty-one different foods/supplement interventions were included in the review. None of the studies reported a negative effect on symptoms, twenty-three reported a positive effect and five had no effect. Eighteen different ways of measuring menstrual-related symptoms were described across the studies. The results indicate a lack of consistency in studies to confidently provide information to eumenorrheic, naturally menstruating women regarding the use of foods/supplements to reduce menstrual symptoms. Determination of menstrual-related symptoms varied along with dose and duration of food or supplements provided. These data provide some evidence for the use of vitamin D, calcium, zinc and curcumin to reduce menstrual-related symptoms of non-hormonal contraceptive users, on an individual basis; however, further investigation is required prior to implementation with a focus on robust protocols to determine and measure changes in menstrual symptoms, with interventions adhering to DRV and safe upper limits.",['Brown N; Martin D; Waldron M; Bruinvels G; Farrant L; Fairchild R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37746736,systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. eumenorrhoeic women were able to find out what foods/supplements are evidenced to reduce menstrual symptoms.
"Awareness about reproductive tract infection, its relation with menstrual hygiene management and health seeking behaviour: A cross-sectional study among adolescent girls of Lucknow.","The reproductive tract infection (RTI) is one of the major health issues associated with menstrual hygiene management which often goes unnoticed and hence remains underdiagnosed and untreated, resulting in devastating health effects on women. It gives way to some common complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, infertility, adverse outcomes of pregnancy, neonatal morbidity and death (in case of a coexisting grievous disease like Human immune deficiency virus (HIV)). A cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural and urban government schools of Lucknow, using two-stage cluster sampling separately for both urban and rural areas. Two schools (one co-education and one all girls) were chosen from each area. A total of 629 participants were taken for the study, 389 from urban and 240 from rural schools. The study subjects were taken proportionately from each school for an interview-based session using a pre-designed and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and Chi-square tests were used to analyse the quantitative data. A total of 629 participants were taken for the study, from rural (240) and urban schools (389) of Lucknow. From urban, 50.9% had fair knowledge about RTI. Whereas 71.3% from urban had fair knowledge about RTI. Lower abdominal pain (54.8%) and vaginal discharge (32.6%) were the most common complaint reported by the participants related to RTI. Only 58.1% from urban and 32.6% from rural used sanitary pads as menstrual absorbents. The presence of vaginal discharge showed a significant relation (<i>P</i> value < 0.001) with the type of menstrual absorbent used.

Impact of COVID-19 on female fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,"The increased social and economic burden caused by the novel COVID-19 outbreak is gradually becoming a worrisome issue for the health sector. The novel coronavirus invades the target cell by binding to ACE2, which is widely expressed in the ovaries, uterus, vagina and placenta. Significantly, the SARS-CoV-2 is said to interrupt female fertility through regulating ACE2. Thus, it is essential to investigate if the novel COVID-19 hampers female fertility, given that there is no systematic and comprehensive evidence on the association of COVID-19 with female fertility. We will systematically search cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies and self-controlled case series designs in the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBSCO, WHO COVID-19 Database, Chinese Biomedical Databases, China National Knowledge Internet, VIP and WanFang Database. Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms for ""COVID-19"" AND ""female"" AND ""fertility"" will be performed. Eligibility criteria are as follows: population (female patients aged 13-49 years); exposure (infection with SARS-CoV-2); comparison (population without SARS-CoV-2 infections or latent SARS-CoV-2 infections); and outcome (female fertility, such as ovarian reserve function, uterine receptivity, oviducts status and menstruation status). Article screening and data extraction will be undertaken independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. We will use the I<sup>2</sup> statistics to assess the heterogeneity and perform a meta-analysis when sufficiently homogeneous studies are provided.

Symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and cycle phase are associated with enhanced facial emotion detection: An online cross-sectional study.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a depressive disorder affecting 5%-8% of people with menstrual cycles. Despite evidence that facial emotion detection is altered in depressive disorders, with enhanced detection of negative emotions (negativity bias), minimal research exists on premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms and the premenstrual phase on accuracy and intensity at detection of facial emotions. Cross-sectional quasi-experimental design. The Facial Emotion Detection Task was administered to 72 individuals assigned female at birth with no premenstrual dysphoric disorder (<i>n</i> = 30), and provisional PMDD (<i>n</i> = 42), based on a retrospective <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition</i>-based measure of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Facial emotion detection was examined both irrespective of menstrual cycle phase, and as a function of premenstrual phase (yes, no). The task used neutral-to-emotional facial expression morphs (15 images/morph). Participants indicated the emotion detected for each image within the progressive intensity morph. For all six basic emotions (sad, angry, fearful, happy, disgust, and surprise), two scores were calculated: accuracy of responses and the intensity within the morph at which the correct emotion was first detected (image number). Individuals reporting moderate/severe symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder had more accurate and earlier detection of disgust, regardless of cycle phase. In addition, those with provisional premenstrual dysphoric disorder detected sad emotions earlier. A premenstrual dysphoric disorder group × cycle phase interaction also emerged: individuals reporting premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms were more accurate at detecting facial emotions during the premenstrual phase compared to the rest of the cycle, with a large effect size for sad emotions. The findings suggest enhanced facial emotion processing in individuals reporting symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, particularly for sadness and disgust. However, replication is required with larger samples and prospective designs. This premenstrual dysphoric disorder premenstrual emotion detection advantage suggests an adaptive cognitive mechanism in premenstrual syndrome/premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and challenges stigma surrounding premenstrual experiences.",['Boboc B; Oinonen KA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38877749,"premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a depressive disorder affecting 5%-8% of menstrual cycles. the effect of facial emotion detection on accuracy and intensity at detection of facial emotions was investigated. the task was administered to 72 individuals assigned female at birth with no premenstrual dysphoric disorder (i>n/i> = 30), and provisional PMDD (i>n/i> = 42)"
Clinical experience with shear wave elastography (SWE) for assessing healthy uterus in a transabdominal approach.,"Aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and feasibility of transabdominal ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) in assessing sonoelastographic features of the uterus. Twenty-seven premenopausal women were enrolled between 2021 and 2022. Transabdominal SWE measured myometrial stiffness in various uterine segments. Additionally, tissue stiffness of the quadriceps femoris muscle and autochthonous back muscle was measured. Statistical analysis employed non-parametric tests, t test, and a robust mixed linear model. Stiffness values of the uterus and the two investigated muscle types exhibited a similar spectrum: 6.38 ± 2.59 kPa (median 5.61 kPa; range 2.76-11.31 kPa) for the uterine myometrium, 7.22 ± 1.24 kPa (6.82 kPa; 5.11-9.39 kPa) for the quadriceps femoris musle, and 7.43 ± 2.73 kPa (7.41 kPa; 3.10-13.73 kPa) for the autochthonous back muscle. A tendency for significant differences in myometrial stiffness was observed concerning the type of labor mode (mean stiffness of 9.17 ± 1.35 kPa after vaginal birth vs. 3.83 ± 1.35 kPa after Caesarian section, p = 0.01). No significant differences in myometrial stiffness were observed concerning age, BMI, previous pregnancies, uterine flexion and menstrual cycle phase. Transabdominal SWE of uterine stiffness seems to be a fast and practicable method in a clinical setting. Uterine stiffness appears to be largely independent of various factors, except for the mode of delivery. However, further studies are needed to validate these results.",['Stader JM; Recker F; Tonguc T; Ramig O; Thudium M; Matlac D; Mutschler N; Egger EK; Mustea A; Küppers J; Essler M; Jenne J; Strunk HM; Conrad R; Marinova M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914622,a transabdominal ultrasound shear wave elastography study was conducted. the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and feasibility of the study. twenty-seven premenopausal women were enrolled between 2021 and 2022.
Clomiphene and anti-oestrogens for ovulation induction in PCOS.,"Subfertility due to anovulation is a common problem in women. First-line oral treatment is with anti-oestrogens, for example clomiphene citrate, but resistance (failure to ovulate) may be apparent with clomiphene. Alternative and adjunctive treatments have been developed such as tamoxifen, dexamethasone, and bromocriptine. To determine the relative effectiveness of anti-oestrogen agents alone or in combination with other medical therapies in women with subfertility associated with anovulation, possibly caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A search was conducted using the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (May 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), and EMBASE (1980 to May 2009) for identification of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and the references of relevant reviews and RCTs were searched. RCTs comparing oral anti-oestrogen agents for ovulation induction (alone or in conjunction with medical therapies) in anovulatory subfertility were considered. Insulin sensitising agents, aromatase inhibitors, and hyperprolactinaemic infertility were excluded. Data extraction and quality assessment were done independently by two review authors. The primary outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes were pregnancy, ovulation, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, overstimulation, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and women reported adverse effects. This is a substantive update of a previous review. Fifteen RCTs were included. One trial reported live birth. Miscarriage, multiple pregnancy rates and adverse events were poorly reported.Clomiphene was effective in increasing pregnancy rate compared to placebo (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 21.5) as was clomiphene plus dexamethasone treatment (OR 9.46, 95% CI 5.1 to 17.7) compared to clomiphene alone. No evidence of a difference in effect was found between clomiphene versus tamoxifen or clomiphene in conjunction with human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) versus clomiphene alone.The remaining results had only one study in each comparison. A significant improvement in the pregnancy rate was reported for clomiphene plus combined oral contraceptives versus clomiphene alone. No evidence of a difference in effect on pregnancy rate was found with any of the other comparisons. This review shows evidence supporting the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate and clomiphene in combination with dexamethasone for pregnancy rate only. There is limited evidence on the effects of these drugs on outcomes such as miscarriage. Evidence in favour of these interventions is flawed due to the lack of evidence on live births.",['Brown J; Farquhar C; Beck J; Boothroyd C; Hughes E'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295,"subfertility due to anovulation is common problem in women. first-line oral treatment is with anti-oestrogens, for example clomiphene citrate. resistance (failure to ovulate) may be apparent with clomiphene. alternative and adjunctive treatments have been developed."
The influence of assisted reproductive technologies-related stressors and social support on perceived stress and depression.,"While assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have helped many people experiencing infertility become pregnant, the ART process can take a psychological toll. This study examined whether and how perceived stress- and depression-related symptoms vary among individuals at different stages of the infertility and ART process, and whether ART-specific stressors and emotional support are associated with mental health symptomatology. Data were collected using an online REDCap survey administered between July 2021 and March 2022. The survey was administered to 240 participants who had experienced infertility, including those who had not yet accessed ART, those undergoing ART but who were not yet pregnant, those currently pregnant through ART, and those who had given birth in the last year through ART. Each participant completed the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (range 0-40) and the Edinburgh Depression Scale (range 0-30). Participants who had undergone ART were asked about their experience of ART-specific stressors and how helpful partner and provider support had been during the ART process. Survey data were analyzed using ANOVA and multivariate linear regressions. 88% of participants reported medium or high levels of perceived stress, and 43.8% of respondents showed probable indications of depression. Perceived stress and depression symptoms were significantly higher for individuals currently undergoing, but not yet pregnant from, ART treatments. These effect sizes were substantial; for example, depression scores in this group were five points higher than among currently pregnant individuals and nine points higher than among postpartum individuals. For the subset of participants who had used or were currently undergoing ART (N = 221), perceived social stigma and the physical and time demands of ART were significantly associated with higher stress and depression symptoms, while partner emotional support was associated with lower perceived stress. The ART process exacerbates perceived stress and depression symptoms among individuals experiencing infertility. Given the potential long-term impacts on both parent and child wellbeing, clinicians and policymaking groups, including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), should consider making access to mental health services a standard of care during infertility treatment.",['Gupta A; Lu E; Thayer Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068405,study examined whether and how perceived stress- and depression-related symptoms vary among individuals at different stages of the infertility and ART process.

Data-driven acoustic control of a spherical bubble using a Koopman linear quadratic regulator.,"Koopman operator theory has gained interest as a framework for transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on abstract function spaces, which preserves the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the system. These spaces can be approximated through data-driven methodologies, which enables the application of classical linear control strategies to nonlinear systems. Here, a Koopman linear quadratic regulator (KLQR) was used to acoustically control the nonlinear dynamics of a single spherical bubble, as described by the well-known Rayleigh-Plesset equation, with several objectives: (1) simple harmonic oscillation at amplitudes large enough to incite nonlinearities, (2) stabilization of the bubble at a nonequilibrium radius, and (3) periodic and quasiperiodic oscillation with multiple frequency components of arbitrary amplitude. The results demonstrate that the KLQR controller can effectively drive a spherical bubble to radially oscillate according to prescribed trajectories using both broadband and single-frequency acoustic driving. This approach has several advantages over previous efforts to acoustically control bubbles, including the ability to track arbitrary trajectories, robustness, and the use of linear control methods, which do not depend on initial guesses.",['Gibson AJ; Yee XC; Calvisi ML'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38980098,Koopman operator theory has gained interest as a framework for transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on abstract function spaces. this framework preserves the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the system. this approach has several advantages over previous efforts to acoustically control bubbles.
Osteopontin expression in dromedary camel's conceptuses during the peri-implantation period.,"The reproductive efficiency of dromedary camels is hindered by challenges such as early embryonic mortality, which may be attributed to a lack of synchronization between conceptus signalling and uterine receptivity. Understanding the intricate biological processes involved in feto-maternal interactions during implantation is crucial to address these limitations. Osteopontin (OPN) is a protein involved in cell signalling and adhesion, playing a crucial role in embryonic implantation. Previous studies have shown the presence of OPN in the uterine endometrium of various mammalian species including dromedary camels. However, the expression pattern of OPN in dromedary conceptuses remains unexplored. Thus, the current study aimed, for the first time, to investigate the temporospatial expression of OPN in dromedary conceptuses during the peri-implantation period at Days 8, 10, and 12 of pregnancy. Twelve conceptuses were recovered non-surgically from pregnant females on Days 8, 10, 12 of pregnancy. Quantitative real-time PCR (qrt-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were employed for analysis of the expression of OPN mRNA and protein. The results revealed significant increases in both OPN mRNA and protein expression started on Day 10 and peaked at Day 12 of pregnancy. Immuno-localization confirmed the presence of OPN protein in the trophectoderm and endoderm of dromedary conceptuses. In conclusion, the expression and localization of OPN during the peri-implantation period in dromedary conceptuses imply its involvement as a crucial reproductive factor and its upregulation during this period, with a pronounced increase close to attachment time (Day 12 of pregnancy) further supports its role in embryo adhesion, implantation, and placentation.",['Moqbel MS; Alhaider AK; Almathen F; Amor NNB; Al-Ramadan SY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075937,"dromedary camels are undergoing a peri-implantation period. the reproductive efficiency of dromedary camels is hindered by challenges such as early embryonic mortality. the current study aimed, for the first time, to investigate the temporospatial expression of OPN in dromedary conceptuses during the peri-implantation period."
"Microfluidic chips in female reproduction: a systematic review of status, advances, and challenges.","The female reproductive system is essential to women's health, human reproduction and societal well-being. However, the clinical translation of traditional research models is restricted due to the uncertain effects and low efficiency. Emerging evidence shows that microfluidic chips provide valuable platforms for studying the female reproductive system, while no paper has ever comprehensively discussed the topic. Here, a total of 161 studies out of 14,669 records are identified in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and IEEE Xplore databases. Among these, 61 studies focus on oocytes, which further involves culture, cell surgeries (oocyte separation, rotation, enucleation, and denudation), evaluation and cryopreservation. Forty studies investigate embryo manipulation via microfluidic chips, covering <i>in vitro</i> fertilization, cryopreservation and functional evaluation. Forty-six studies reconstitute both the physiological and pathological statuses of <i>in vivo</i> organs, mostly involved in placenta and fetal membrane research. Fourteen studies perform drug screening and toxicity testing. In this review, we summarize the current application of microfluidic chips in studying the female reproductive system, the advancements in materials and methods, and discuss the future challenges. The present evidence suggests that microfluidic chips-assisted reproductive system reconstruction is promising and more studies are urgently needed.",['Wu T; Yan J; Nie K; Chen Y; Wu Y; Wang S; Zhang J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39113805,"the female reproductive system is essential to women's health, human reproduction and societal well-being. 61 studies focus on oocytes, which further involves culture, cell surgeries."
Prevalence of premenstrual syndrome in adolescent girls.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that appear during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, disappear after menstruation, and are recurrent in every cycle. PMS significantly affects the social and academic lives of adolescents, and historically, it has been neglected by healthcare professionals. We aimed to evaluate the current point prevalence of PMS in Turkish adolescents presented to a tertiary adolescent medicine clinic. Adolescent girls between the ages of 12 and 18 and who had regular menstrual cycles for at least three months without any mental or chronic illness were assessed. A clinic information form and the 'Premenstrual Syndrome Scale' (PMSS) questionnaire were completed. Those with a PMSS total score of more than 50% of the total score (>110 out of 220) were classified as PMS (+). Those classified as PMS were further classified as mild-moderate (score: 110-150) and severe (>150). The study included 417 adolescents. The point prevalence of PMS was found to be 61.2% (n:255). Of those with PMS, 49.4% had mild-moderate and 50.6% had severe PMS. The mean PMSS score was 154.56 ± 30.43 in the PMS group and 76.17 ± 20.65 in the non-PMS group (p<0.001). The mean age was 15.41 ± 1.3 years in the PMS group and 14.88 ± 1.35 years in the non-PMS group (p=0.029). None of the youth in our study applied to our clinic due to any premenstrual complaints. PMS is frequently observed in youth, as indicated by our study. Adolescents have little awareness of PMS and their need for healthcare services. During the evaluation of adolescents, it is important for health care providers to acquire knowledge regarding the features of menstrual cycles and conduct a comprehensive psychosocial assessment.",['Akbulut Ö; Jafari L; Aygün Arı D; Pehlivantürk Kızılkan M; Derman O; Akgül S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39024593,"premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that appear during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. the point prevalence of PMS was found to be 61.2% (n:255) of those with PMS, 49.4% had mild-moderate and 50.6% had severe PMS."
Measuring activity-rest rhythms under different acclimation periods in a marine fish using automatic deep learning-based video tracking.,"Most organisms synchronize to an approximately 24-hour (circadian) rhythm. This study introduces a novel deep learning-powered video tracking method to assess the stability, fragmentation, robustness and synchronization of activity rhythms in <i>Xyrichtys novacula</i>. Experimental <i>X. novacula</i> were distributed into three groups and monitored for synchronization to a 14/10 hours of light/dark to assess acclimation to laboratory conditions. Group GP7 acclimated for 1 week and was tested from days 7 to 14, GP14 acclimated for 14 days and was tested from days 14 to 21 and GP21 acclimated for 21 days and was tested from days 21 to 28. Telemetry data from individuals in the wild depicted their natural behavior. Wild fish displayed a robust and minimally fragmented rhythm, entrained to the natural photoperiod. Under laboratory conditions, differences in activity levels were observed between light and dark phases. However, no differences were observed in activity rhythm metrics among laboratory groups related to acclimation period. Notably, longer acclimation (GP14 and GP21) led to a larger proportion of individuals displaying rhythm synchronization with the imposed photoperiod. Our work introduces a novel approach for monitoring biological rhythms in laboratory conditions, employing a specifically engineered video tracking system based on deep learning, adaptable for other species.",['Akaarir M; Martorell-Barceló M; Morro B; Suau M; Alós J; Aspillaga E; Gamundí A; Grau A; Lana A; Nicolau MC; Pons A; Rial RV; Signaroli M; Barcelo-Serra M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38975732,marine fish synchronize to approximately 24-hour (circadian) rhythm. a new method for monitoring biological rhythms in laboratory conditions.
Endometriosis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Endometriosis is a relatively common condition in which endometrial tissue is established in locations outside the uterus where, like the eutopic endometrium, it responds to hormonal stimuli and develops internal bleeding, inflammation, and fibrosis. These changes are associated with chronic and often debilitating cyclic pain and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is multifactorial, and several theories have been proposed to explain it. These include retrograde menstruation, celomic metaplasia, embryologic rests, and lymphovascular spread. Hormones, immunologic status, and genetic factors may also play a role. In most patients, the disease involves pelvic organs, but rarely it may also extend to a large variety of distant locations in the body. Patients with ovarian endometriosis are at higher risk for developing ovarian carcinomas including endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. Some of these carcinomas may arise in a background of structural and/or nuclear atypia within the endometriotic foci. There is no known cure for endometriosis and treatment mostly consists of managing chronic pain or infertility.",['Arafah M; Rashid S; Akhtar M'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33044230,"endometriosis is a relatively common condition in which endometrial tissue is established in locations outside the uterus where it responds to hormonal stimuli. it develops internal bleeding, inflammation, and fibrosis. the pathogenesis of endometriosis is multifactorial, and several theories have been proposed to explain it."
Secretory Phospholipase A2 Levels Are High in Women with Sickle Cell Disease and Menstruation-Induced Vaso-Occlusive Crises.,"Menstruation-induced vaso-occlusive crisis (MIVOC) is a significant cause of morbidity in women with sickle cell disease (SCD). Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is an inflammatory biomarker that is elevated in vaso-occlusive events such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), but its role in MIVOC is not previously studied. This study compared the serum level of sPLA2 among women with MIVOC and those without MIVOC. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. 354 women with SCD were screened for MIVOC using a structured questionnaire. sPLA2 levels were assayed using a standard ELISA while full blood counts were performed on an automated hematology analyzer. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software v26.0. Results were summarized as frequencies, percentages, and mean ± standard deviation. Variables were compared using the Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation. A <i>p</i>-value of <.05 was considered significant. The prevalence of MIVOC was 26.8%. Participants with MIVOC (<i>n</i> = 95) had significantly lower mean hemoglobin concentration (8.00 ± 2.03g/dL <i>vs.</i> 9.95 ± 4.15g/dL, <i>p</i> < .000), significantly higher mean platelets count (518.71 ± 84.58 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L <i>vs</i> 322.21 ± 63.80 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, <i>p</i> < .000) and higher sPLA2 level (6.58 ± 1.94 IU <i>vs</i> 6.03 ± 0.42 IU, <i>p</i> = .008) compared to those without MIVOC (<i>n</i> = 95). Among participants with MIVOC, sPLA2 levels positively correlated with total white blood cell, absolute neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. This study demonstrates that MIVOC is common among women with SCD and that the pathophysiology of MIVOC may have an inflammatory basis similar to that of ACS. The potential role of anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet agents in preventing and treating MIVOC may be explored.",['Ibrahim L; Gwarzo DH; Yusuf AA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38961630,secretory phospholipase A2 levels are high in women with sickle cell disease. sPLA2 is an inflammatory biomarker that is elevated in vaso-occlusive events such as acute chest syndrome.
Hypothalamic-Ovarian axis and Adiposity Relationship in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Physiopathology and Therapeutic Options for the Management of Metabolic and Inflammatory Aspects.,"The goal of the present review is to address the main adiposity-related alterations in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) focusing on hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (H-P-O) axis and to provide an overview of nutraceutical and pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Female reproduction is a complex and delicate interplay between neuroendocrine signals involving the H-P-O axis. Elements that disrupt the balance of these interactions can lead to metabolic and reproductive disorders, such as PCOS. This disorder includes menstrual, metabolic, and biochemical abnormalities as well as hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulatory menstrual cycles, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinemia which share an inflammatory state with other chronic diseases. Moreover, as in a self-feeding cycle, high androgen levels in PCOS lead to visceral fat deposition, resulting in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, further stimulating ovarian and adrenal androgen production. In fact, regardless of age and BMI, women with PCOS have more adipose tissue and less lean mass than healthy women. Excessive adiposity, especially visceral adiposity, is capable of affecting female reproduction through direct mechanisms compromising the luteal phase, and indirect mechanisms as metabolic alterations able to affect the function of the H-P-O axis. The intricate crosstalk between adiposity, inflammatory status and H-P-O axis function contributes to the main adiposity-related alterations in PCOS, and alongside currently available hormonal treatments, nutraceutical and pharmacological therapeutic strategies can be exploited to treat these alterations, in order to enable a more comprehensive synergistic and tailored treatment.",['Lonardo MS; Cacciapuoti N; Guida B; Di Lorenzo M; Chiurazzi M; Damiano S; Menale C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38172476,hypothalamic-ovarian axis and Adiposity Relationship in polycystic Ovary syndrome. aim of present review is to address main adiposity-related alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome. adiposity is capable of affecting ovarian and adrenal androgen production.
Autologous umbilical cord blood infusion for the treatment of autism in young children: A within-subjects open label study on safety (assessed via caregiver report) and efficacy.,"This study aimed to document the safety and efficacy of a single infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) in 20 autistic children aged 24-72 months. A pre-post treatment within-subjects open label design was used. At T = 0, 6, 12, and 18 months, participants underwent detailed and structured safety evaluations (via caregiver report), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (Vineland-3), Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale (SB-5), Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test, Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC), Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Behavior Inventory, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, Sensory Experience Questionnaire (SEQ-2.1), Child Behavior Checklist, Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Improvement (CGI-I) Scales, and eye-gaze tracking. UCB infusion was conducted at T = 6 months, hence, 0-6 months was the control period, and 6-18 months the follow-up period. Of 20 children recruited, 19 completed the study and 1 was withdrawn due to UCB not meeting quality control criteria for infusion. There were 15 males and 4 females with an overall mean (SD) age of 4.15 (0.62) years. Mean (SD) cell dose administered was 38.16 (9.82) million cells/kg. None suffered serious adverse events although there were mild behavioral side effects and one unit grew coagulase negative staphylococcus from a post-thaw sample. There were no significant differences in Vineland-3, SB-5, BOSCC, and SEQ-2.1 scores at T = 12 and T = 18 months. Twelve participants had T = 18 CGI-I scores of 2-3 (minimally to much improved), seven participants had scores of 4 (no change). Autologous UCB infusion in autistic children is generally safe but not without risks, including that of infection. In this within-subjects study, some children showed global symptom improvements while others showed no change.

Female Pelvic Conditions: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"It is estimated that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects about 10% of women of reproductive age in the United States. Principal risk factors include obesity and a family history of PCOS. A diagnosis of PCOS should be considered in women with irregular or absent menstrual cycles, issues related to hyperandrogenism, or infertility. The Rotterdam diagnostic criteria require two of the following three factors: oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries identified on ultrasonography. Laboratory tests are recommended to rule out other conditions and factors, including thyroid conditions, hyperprolactinemia, atypical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and tumors. The mainstays of treatment are lifestyle changes to achieve weight loss and combination oral contraceptives (COCs). (PCOS is an off-label use of COCs.) A weight loss of 5% to 10% has been shown to decrease PCOS symptoms. Medical or surgical management of obesity may be indicated. COCs provide endometrial protection and help manage acne and hirsutism. (Hirsutism is an off-label use of COCs. Acne is an off-label use of some COCs.) Routine acne treatments also are used. Hirsutism may improve with topical cosmetic treatments, spironolactone, or finasteride. (Hirsutism is an off-label use of spironolactone and finasteride.) Infertility is a common issue in patients with PCOS. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole is the first-line treatment for PCOS-related anovulation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues also are used to induce ovulation. (This is an off-label use of letrozole and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues.).",['Wilkinson LD; Brady PH; Gin GT; Rosenblum E'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35420404,"polycystic ovary syndrome affects about 10% of women of reproductive age in the united states. the diagnosis should be considered in women with irregular or absent menstrual cycles, issues related to hyperandrogenism, or infertility."
Frequency of menstrual abnormalities and their associated neuroimaging findings in women with focal refractory epilepsy.,"Patients with refractory epilepsy can suffer from psychological and physical problems. Epilepsy can also be associated with menstruation abnormalities in women. In this paper, we aim to survey women with focal refractory epilepsy who also suffer from menstrual abnormalities. This cross-sectional study was performed in 2018 in Tertiary Epilepsy Center in Kashani Hospital, Isfahan, Iran and Milad hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A total number of 381 patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy joined the study based on an inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical characteristics of epilepsy, menstrual issues and brain MRI findings were assessed. Among 381 women with refractory epilepsy, 250 had refractory focal epilepsy (65.61%), and the others (34.39%) had generalized refractory epilepsy. 132 patients out of 381 had menstrual abnormalities (34.65%). Among 132 women with coexisting refractory epilepsy and menstrual abnormalities, 86 (65.15%) were diagnosed with refractory focal epilepsy, and 46 (34.86%) had generalized refractory epilepsy (p value = 0.041). Oligomenorrhea-hypomenorrhea was the most common type of menstrual abnormality in women with refractory epilepsy seen in 83 (62.87%) (p value = 0.039). The most common brain MRI pathology in women with refractory focal epilepsy was mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (39.20%, p = 0.00). We report that almost one-third of women with refractory epilepsy suffer from menstrual disorders, and the most common disorder was Oligomenorrhea-hypomenorrhea, and the most common brain pathology was MTS. It has also been a hypothesis that reproductive dysfunctions are connected to temporal lobe malfunctions, and more specific studies are required in this issue.",['Ranjbar M; Mehvari Habibabadi J; Poorazarian F; Mohammadi B; Naghibi SN; Tabrizi N'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32507941,refractory epilepsy can be associated with menstruation abnormalities in women. epilepsy can also be associated with menstruation abnormalities in women.
Factors Associated with Exclusive Use of Hygienic Methods during Menstruation among Adolescent Girls (15-19 Years) in Urban India: Evidence from NFHS-5.,"Menstrual hygiene is a critical public health concern for adolescent girls in urban India. However, there is a paucity of research on this subject, particularly on a national scale. To the best of our knowledge, this study diverges from previous research, as the majority of prior investigations in India have centered on rural locales, married individuals, and those aged between 15 and 24 years. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the factors associated with the exclusive use of hygienic methods during menstruation among urban adolescent girls (15-19 years) in India. A total of 25136 samples were included in this analysis from the National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS-5). The Binary logistic regression model has been administered to determine the associated factors of the exclusive use of hygienic methods among adolescent girls. The results of the multivariate model revealed significant positive associations between higher education levels and usage of menstrual hygiene management products (AOR: 1.860; 95 % CI: 1.418-2.439), (AOR: 2.110; 95 % CI: 1.553-2.867). Additionally, individuals in higher wealth quintiles were more likely to use MHM products, with the richest quintile showing the highest likelihood (AOR: 5.310; 95 % CI: 4.494-6.275). Attendance at cultural events such as cinema or theater was positively associated with MHM product utilization (AOR: 1.338; 95 % CI: 1.181-1.517).Conversely, Lack of access to sanitation facilities was inversely associated with MHM product utilization (AOR: 0.742; 95 % CI: 0.628-0.877). Muslim girls had lower odds than Hindus (AOR: 0.576; 95 % CI: 0.520-0.637). Substantial regional variations were evident, with the Western (AOR: 0.879; 95 % CI: 0.759-1.019), Eastern (AOR: 0.747; 95 % CI: 0.654-0.854), Central (AOR: 0.349; 95 % CI: 0.313-0.388), and North-eastern regions (AOR: 0.597; 95 % CI: 0.490-0.727) displaying diminished odds of MHM product usage relative to the southern region. General caste had higher odds compared to scheduled caste (AOR: 1.255, 95 % CI: 1.103-1.429), while other backward caste had lower odds (AOR: 0.858, 95 % CI: 0.771-0.955). These findings underscore the importance of addressing inequalities in access to menstrual hygiene products among urban adolescent girls in India. Targeted interventions and educational programs are essential to ensure equitable access and promote overall health and well-being.",['Roy D; Kasemi N; Halder M; Majumder M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554,NFHS-5 study aims to fill this gap by investigating factors associated with exclusive use of hygienic methods during menstruation among urban adolescent girls (15-19 years) in urban India. a total of 25136 samples were included in this analysis from the national family health survey 5 (NFHS-5)
Hormonal treatments for endometriosis: The endocrine background.,"Endometriosis is a benign uterine disorder characterized by menstrual pain and infertility, deeply affecting women's health. It is a chronic disease and requires a long term management. Hormonal drugs are currently the most used for the medical treatment and are based on the endocrine pathogenetic aspects. Estrogen-dependency and progesterone-resistance are the key events which cause the ectopic implantation of endometrial cells, decreasing apoptosis and increasing oxidative stress, inflammation and neuroangiogenesis. Endometriotic cells express AMH, TGF-related growth factors (inhibin, activin, follistatin) CRH and stress related peptides. Endocrine and inflammatory changes explain pain and infertility, and the systemic comorbidities described in these patients, such as autoimmune (thyroiditis, arthritis, allergies), inflammatory (gastrointestinal/urinary diseases) and mental health disorders.The hormonal treatment of endometriosis aims to block of menstruation through an inhibition of hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis or by causing a pseudodecidualization with consequent amenorrhea, impairing the progression of endometriotic implants. GnRH agonists and antagonists are effective on endometriosis by acting on pituitary-ovarian function. Progestins are mostly used for long term treatments (dienogest, NETA, MPA) and act on multiple sites of action. Combined oral contraceptives are also used for reducing endometriosis symptoms by inhibiting ovarian function. Clinical trials are currently going on selective progesterone receptor modulators, selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors. Nowadays, all these hormonal drugs are considered the first-line treatment for women with endometriosis to improve their symptoms, to postpone surgery or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. This review aims to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art on the current and future hormonal treatments for endometriosis, exploring the endocrine background of the disease.",['Vannuccini S; Clemenza S; Rossi M; Petraglia F'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34405378,endometriosis is a benign uterine disorder characterized by menstrual pain and infertility. it is a chronic disease and requires a long term management. hormones are currently the most used for the medical treatment.
Psychophysiological Responses to High-Intensity Interval Training Exercise over Menstrual Cycle Phases: An Exploratory Study.,"Although there is potential for the menstrual cycle to impact psychophysiological responses to exercise, there has been a paucity of studies investigating this aspect, specifically in the context of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). This exploratory study aimed to examine the psychophysiological responses to HIIT over the menstrual cycle. Twenty-three healthy and physically active young women were recruited. Each woman completed a cycle ergometer HIIT session in the menstrual, follicular, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in a random order. Psychophysiological variables of interest were collected at baseline, and during and after exercise. Primary variables of interest were anxiety, mood, motivation, enjoyment, arousal, affect, and menstrual distress. Higher pain, water retention, behavior change (related to social interactions, eating habits, and self-performance), and autonomic reactions (consisting of nausea, dizziness, hot flashes, and cold sweats) were observed before HIIT during the menstrual phase compared with the follicular phase ( P < 0.05). Participants exhibited worse psychological responses to HIIT sessions during the menstrual phase, followed by the luteal phase. Findings also noted participants arrived to the laboratory with lower motivation to initiate HIIT sessions during the luteal and menstrual phases compared with the follicular phase. This difference was observed before and during HIIT. Motivation and depressive symptoms showed a significant reduction from pre-HIIT to post-HIIT ( P < 0.05), regardless of menstrual phase. The findings revealed that the menstrual cycle had a significant impact on psychophysiological responses. Moreover, HIIT could be adopted to improve motivation and depressive symptoms; however, further research is needed to explore the effects of HIIT across the menstrual cycle in women with clinical depression.",['Chavan M; Prado RCR; Ashley CD; Kilpatrick MW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38555489,"twenty-three healthy and physically active young women recruited. each woman completed cycle ergometer HIIT session in random order. primary variables of interest were anxiety, mood, motivation, enjoyment, arousal, affect, and menstrual distress."
"""The weather is not good"": exploring the menstrual health experiences of menstruators with and without disabilities in Vanuatu.","Menstrual health is essential for gender equality and achieving the sustainable development goals. Though currently lacking, understanding and addressing menstrual health and social related inequalities requires comparison of experiences between menstruators with and without disabilities. We completed a mixed-methods population-based study of water, sanitation and hygiene, disability and menstrual health in TORBA and SANMA Provinces, Vanuatu. Methods included a census, nested case-control study, in-depth interviews (IDIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), PhotoVoice and structured observations. We undertook a population census of 11,000+ households and recruited 164 menstruators with and 169 without disabilities (aged 10-45) into a nested case-control study. 20 menstruators across both groups were selected for the qualitative component. Menstruators with disabilities were five times (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 5.5, 95% Confidence Interval 1.8 - 16.5) more likely to use different bathing facilities to others in the household, nearly twice as likely (1.8, 1.1 - 3.1) to miss social activities, and three times (3.0, 1.6 - 5.7) more likely to eat alone during menstruation. Menstrual restrictions were widespread for all, but collecting water and managing menstrual materials was harder for menstruators with disabilities, particularly those requiring caregivers' support. These factors negatively impacted menstruators with disabilities' comfort, safety and hygiene, yet they reported less interference of menstruation on participation. Negative factors affecting all menstruators disproportionately impact those with disabilities, compounding existing inequalities. Menstruators with disabilities may have reported less interference because they are accustomed to greater participation restrictions than others.

Is menopause still evolving? Evidence from a longitudinal study of multiethnic populations and its relevance to women's health.,"To reflect on the impact of changing patterns of delayed marriage and reproduction and to seek evidence as to whether menopause is still evolving, characteristics of the menopause transition were investigated within and between ethnic populations in this study. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data on 747 middle-aged women obtained from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) from 1996 to 2008. The ethnic groups included: Afro-American, Chinese, Japanese, Caucasian, and Hispanic. Perimenopause age and duration, menopause age, and hormonal indicators of menopause were examined across five ethnicities. We found a similar window of menopause age within populations, but no significant difference in perimenopause and menopause age between populations. The rate of increase of follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone differed significantly in Hispanics and African-Americans during the menopause transition period. The broad window of variation in age at menopause within the population and the absence of significant differences between populations, in combination with population variation in menopause symptoms, suggest that menopause is a relatively recently evolved and still evolving trait. Under the mate choice theory of menopause, menopause is the result of the accumulation of infertility mutations in older women due to men's preference for younger mates. We propose a shifting mate choice-shifting menopause model which posits that, as the age of mate choice/marriage shifts to older ages, so will the age at menopause, and that menopause is a transient phase of female fertility; it can de-evolve, be delayed, if not disappear completely. Integrated longitudinal menopausal studies linked with genomics and hormonal studies on diverse ethnic populations can provide valuable information bearing on women's health and personalized medicine.",['Chan S; Gomes A; Singh RS'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307019,study of women's health Across the Nation (SWAN) found a similar window of menopause age within populations. but no significant difference in perimenopause and menopause age between populations.
Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adolescents.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) represent two premenstrual disorders characterized by physical and psychological symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, prior to the onset of menses, and have a negative impact on the psychosocial functioning of affected individuals. PMS, more common than PMDD, affects 20-40% of menstruating women, with common symptoms including fatigue, irritability, mood swings, depression, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, acne, changes in appetite and food cravings. PMDD, affecting a smaller percentage of women, is characterized by more severe symptoms and is listed as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). While the pathophysiology of these premenstrual disorders remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abnormal serotonergic activity, and aberrations in progesterone and the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) may all play a role in these disorders. Treatment of PMS and PMDD is focused on alleviation of symptoms and improvement of functioning and quality of life for affected individuals. The treatment of severe PMS and PMDD typically requires pharmacologic therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and non-contraceptive estrogen formulations. Non-pharmacologic treatment with diet, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), certain vitamin and herbal supplements, and acupuncture may additionally be effective for some individuals.",['Itriyeva K'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35534402,"premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are two premenstrual disorders. symptoms occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. symptoms include fatigue, irritability, mood swings, depression, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, acne, changes in appetite and food cravings."
Microwave therapy for cervical ectropion.,"Cervical ectropion is considered as one of the most common types of chronic cervicitis in China. Topical treatments for cervical ectropion including microwave tissue coagulation, are widely used in many hospitals in China. Nowadays, the necessary intervention for inflammatory cervical ectopy is controversial. To compare the efficacy and potential side effects of microwave tissue coagulation with other interventions or no intervention in the treatment of cervical ectropion. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1974 to 2005); The Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM, 1978 to 2005), The Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC, 1994 to 2005), CAJ Full-text Database (1994 to 2005) and Chinese Scientific Journals Database (1989 to 2005). We also searched related literature on the Internet with search engines such as Google, searched the reference lists of articles and hand searched relevant Chinese journals. Only authentic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Two authors independently interviewed the original authors of claimed RCTs published in China and then assessed the quality of the three included RCTs and extracted data. No studies were found that met the participant inclusion criteria of the protocol. Although three studies were identified as authentic RCTs from 92 potential RCTs, it was not possible to confirm that the participants were symptomatic prior to treatment. Of these three studies two trials compared microwave therapy with laser and one compared microwave therapy with interferon-alpha suppository therapy. Microwave therapy showed a better effect on cervical appearance over laser therapy in the women with grade II and III and also improved cervical appearance over interferon-alpha suppository therapy. There was no difference in grade I women. Microwave therapy showed less adverse bleeding than laser therapy during the treatment. However, the methodological quality of the three RCTs was generally low. No trial compared treatment to no intervention and most trials didn't assess relief of symptoms or quality of life and satisfaction, which are very important to women. There are no RCTs comparing microwave therapy with other treatments or no treatment in symptomatic women with cervical ectropion. Although microwave therapy improved the appearance of the cervix over both laser therapy and interferon-alpha suppository therapy it is not clear if there is any other benefit for women.",['Yang K; Li J; Liu Y; Ma B; Roberts H; Tan J; Tian J; Wu T; Zhang P'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17943899,microwave therapy for cervical ectropion is widely used in many hospitals in china. the necessary intervention for inflammatory cervical ectopy is controversial.
Hungry runners - low energy availability in male endurance athletes and its impact on performance and testosterone: mini-review.,"Low Energy Availability (LEA) arises from the inability to cover energy needs and requirements of training or normal physiological functions. This value differs from the energy balance, which takes into account the total daily energy intake compared to all the energy expended, regardless of the amount of fat-free mass. Insufficient energy consumption affects recovery, adaptation processes, increases the risk of injury or illness, so all of this can negatively affect performance. This mini-review is written on research articles in Pubmed database related to LEA in endurance-trained men and its impact on performance and testosterone. This article also clarifies the prevalence of LEA in male endurance athletes and its correlation to Relative Energy Deficiency in Sports (RED-S). LEA occurs in male endurance athletes and correlates with decreased testosterone levels, decreased bone density and also Resting Metabolic Rate. In endurance-trained men, there is great potential for the negative consequences of low energy availability. It can also be said that there are possibilities for primary screening, so we recommend regular check-ups of blood markers, body structure and keeping not only training but also dietary records, which can increase awareness of an adequate energy balance.",['Cupka M; Sedliak M'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37052052,"low energy availability arises from the inability to cover energy needs. this value differs from the energy balance, which takes into account the total daily energy intake compared to all the energy expended. insufficient energy consumption affects recovery, adaptation processes, increases the risk of injury or illness."
Progesterone administration for luteal phase deficiency in human reproduction: an old or new issue?,"Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) is described as a condition of insufficient progesterone exposure to maintain a regular secretory endometrium and allow for normal embryo implantation and growth. Recently, scientific focus is turning to understand the physiology of implantation, in particular the several molecular markers of endometrial competence, through the recent transcriptomic approaches and microarray technology. In spite of the wide availability of clinical and instrumental methods for assessing endometrial competence, reproducible and reliable diagnostic tests for LPD are currently lacking, so no type-IA evidence has been proposed by the main scientific societies for assessing endometrial competence in infertile couples. Nevertheless, LPD is a very common condition that may occur during a series of clinical conditions, and during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and hyperstimulation (COH) programs. In many cases, the correct approach to treat LPD is the identification and correction of any underlying condition while, in case of no underlying dysfunction, the treatment becomes empiric. To date, no direct data is available regarding the efficacy of luteal phase support for improving fertility in spontaneous cycles or in non-gonadotropin induced ovulatory cycles. On the contrary, in gonadotropin in vitro fertilization (IVF) and non-IVF cycles, LPD is always present and progesterone exerts a significant positive effect on reproductive outcomes. The scientific debate still remains open regarding progesterone administration protocols, specially on routes of administration, dose and timing and the potential association with other drugs, and further research is still needed.",['Palomba S; Santagni S; La Sala GB'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26585269,luteal phase deficiency is a condition of insufficient progesterone exposure to maintain a secretory endometrium and allow for normal embryo implantation and growth. luteal phase deficiency is a condition of insufficient progesterone exposure to maintain a regular secretory endometrium. progesterone exerts a significant positive effect on reproductive outcomes.
Sociodemographic disparities in postnatal care coverage at comprehensive health centers in Hamedan City.,"Postnatal care (PNC) is a crucial component of continuous healthcare and can be influenced by sociodemographic factors. This study aimed to examine the sociodemographic disparities in PNC coverage in Hamedan City. In this cross-sectional study, we utilized existing data recorded in the Health Integrated System of Hamedan City, located in Iran, from 2020 to 2021. The study population consisted of 853 women who were over 15 years old and had given birth within the past 42 days. The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software was used to evaluate the socioeconomic inequalities in PNC coverage. Overall, 531 (62.3%) of the women received three postnatal visits. The absolute concentration index (ACI) indicates that women aged 20-35 years, illiterate women, housewives, insured individuals, and urban residents experience a higher magnitude of inequality in PNC coverage. The negative values of the ACI suggest that the health index is concentrated among disadvantaged groups, with educational level inequalities being more pronounced than those related to age. Postnatal care coverage among mothers was relatively adequate; however, sociodemographic inequalities existed in the utilization of PNC services. It is recommended that policymakers make efforts to increase access to PNC services for mothers from low socio-economic groups.",['Maleki A; Soltani F; Abasalizadeh M; Bakht R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39104884,postnatal care (PNC) is a crucial component of continuous healthcare. it can be influenced by sociodemographic factors.
The course of Rotavirus A (RVA) infection in young racing pigeons during the racing season.,"Pigeon Rotavirus A (RVA) infection has been confirmed in pigeons in the last decade as a cause of Young Pigeon Disease (YPD). Although YPD has been known for many years to date, no studies have been conducted to track the spread of RVA infection in pigeons during the racing season. The presented research aims to determine the course of RVA infection during the flights of young racing pigeons in the summer season, in one of the districts in the Mazovian Voivodeship in Poland. Faecal samples of pigeons collected from transport baskets in vehicles transporting pigeons to the starting point were tested. The quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the genetic material of RVA. Samples taken during 6 flights were analysed. The study showed a percentage increase in infections up to the fourth flight of pigeons, and then their decrease. With Cq values below 20, breeders did not participate in the next flight and/or reported disease in the flock. With positive Cq values of 20 to 30, clinical signs of disease were not reported. Of the 76 breeders participating in the races, at least one positive result was found in 46 (60.5%). Including the occurrence of the disease during the racing season was reported by 11 breeders (14.4%). The main clinical signs in sick pigeons were vomiting, diarrhea and stowed crop. The tested pigeons were not vaccinated against RVA. During training and racing of pigeons, it is not possible to avoid exposing them to pathogens, including RVA, regardless of whether pigeons from different breeders are placed in the same baskets or are in separate baskets. However, after four flights the number of new cases of the disease decreases which indicates the development of immunity. The qRT-PCR test is useful in the diagnosis and differentiation of clinical (Cq below 20) and subclinical RVA infections in racing pigeons.",['Adamczyk K; Ledwoń A; Czopowicz M; Szeleszczuk P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38982473,pigeons have been confirmed as a cause of young Pigeon disease. no studies have been conducted to track the spread of RVA infection.
An electric bicycle tracking algorithm for improved traffic management.,"This paper proposes an efficient electric bicycle tracking algorithm, EBTrack, utilizing the high-precision and lightweight YOLOv7 as the target detector to enhance the efficiency of illegal detection and recognition of electric bicycles. The EBTrack effectively captures the position and trajectory of electric bicycles in complex traffic monitoring scenarios. Firstly, we introduce the feature extraction network, ResNetEB, specifically designed for feature re-identification of electric bicycles. To maintain real-time performance, feature extraction is performed only when generating new object IDs, minimizing the impact on processing speed. Secondly, for accurate target trajectory prediction, we incorporate an adaptive modulated noise scale Kalman filter. Additionally, considering the uncertainty of electric bicycle entry directions in traffic monitoring scenarios, we design a specialized matching mechanism to reduce frequent ID switching. Finally, to validate the algorithm's effectiveness, we have collected diverse video image data of electric bicycle and urban road traffic in Hefei, Anhui Province, encompassing different perspectives, time periods, and weather conditions. We have trained the proposed detector and have evaluated its tracking performance on this comprehensive dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that EBTrack achieves impressive accuracy, with 89.8 % MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) and 94.2 % IDF1 (ID F1-Score). Furthermore, the algorithm effectively reduces ID switching, significantly improving tracking stability and continuity.",['Liu Z; Dai C; Li X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39027556,"electric bicycle tracking algorithm, EBTrack, uses the high-precision and lightweight YOLOv7 as the target detector. the algorithm effectively captures the position and trajectory of electric bicycles in complex traffic monitoring scenarios."

Factors Affecting Response to Infertility Treatment: Case of Iran.,"Infertility affects both women and men in all the countries. Infertility often has profound long-term or short-term impacts on the people involved and puts them at risk of familial and social pressures. According to WHO estimates, between 8% and 12% of all the couples worldwide experience some form of infertility during their reproductive life, i.e. 50‒80 million people are affected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to infertility treatment by taking into account factors such as age, hirsutism, menstruation and galactose among women in Kerman. Of a total of 300 patient files evaluated 220 cases were flawless, of which the study factors were recorded. These data were estimated by Logit model. The dependent variable was the response to treatment (0 and 1) and the independent variables included age of men and women, hirsutism, menstruation, galactose, duration of the period no preventive measures were used and body mass index. After entering the data, model output was analyzed by using the STATA software. The results showed that of all the model variables, female age (prob=0.0065), menstruation (prob=0.04), hirsutism (prob=0.02), marriage age (in months) (prob=0.02) and BMI were significant and other variables were not significant. McFadden analysis for goodness of fit was 0.92. The study results showed that women should pay more attention to variables such as BMI, menstruation quality (regular and irregular) and aging because clinical disregard of any of the above can have a significant impact on the individual's fertility.",['Peyromusavi F; Barouni M; Naderi T; Shahravan A'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26234994,between 8% and 12% of all the couples worldwide experience some form of infertility during their reproductive life. between 8% and 12% of all the couples worldwide experience some form of infertility during their reproductive life.
UV arrows descend from above: lessons from a mass media campaign to improve sun protection behaviours among young adults.,"More than 95% of melanomas in Australia are caused by UV radiation from the sun. Young adults are particularly at risk, with 18-24-year-olds spending more time in the sun and protecting their skin less than older adults. A new mass media campaign was delivered in New South Wales, Australia, to motivate this hard-to-reach group to protect their skin from harmful UV radiation. This paper shares learnings from this campaign for public health educators working across diverse fields. Guided by audience research and testing, the campaign combined fear-based and self-efficacy messaging. UV radiation was portrayed as arrows descending from the sky, transforming it into a visible and ever-present threat. High-reach channels such as cinema, outdoor advertising, online videos, audio apps and social media were used to reach the audience. The campaign was evaluated through an online tracking survey (n = 750, 18-24-year-olds) measuring prompted recognition, message take-out, key diagnostics, and self-reported sun protection intentions and behaviours. The evaluation found that 57% of survey participants recognised the campaign when prompted. Among those that recognised the campaign, 76% said they had used sun protection when outdoors over the summer campaign period (vs 64% of non-recognisers, p < 0.05), and 45% said they had adopted at least three of the five sun protection behaviours (Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek and Slide) 'always' or 'often' (vs. 36% of non-recognisers, p < 0.05). A mass-media campaign that aimed to elicit emotional (fear) and cognitive (perceived efficacy) responses and which drew upon social and heuristic cues was associated with greater self-reported sun protection among the target audience. Delivering a combination of message strategies simultaneously within a campaign tailored to young adults may be more effective than adopting a more singular focus.","[""Overmars C; Dubois S; Maynard P; Scott N; Le Clerc A; Clarke M; McGill S; O'Brien T""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914417,more than 95% of melanomas in australia are caused by UV radiation. 18-24-year-olds spend more time in the sun and protect their skin less than older adults. campaign was commissioned by a mass media group in new south Wales.
"Prevalence, impacts and medical managements of premenstrual syndrome among female students: cross-sectional study in College of Health Sciences, Mekelle University, Mekelle, northern Ethiopia.","Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is used to describe physical, cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms that occur cyclically during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve quickly at or within a few days of the onset of menstruation. The primary aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, impacts and medical managements of PMS on female medical students of Mekelle University College of Health Sciences. A cross-sectional study was conducted among systematically selected female students of Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle town, northern Ethiopia from March to April 2013. A structured and pretested self-administered questionnaire was employed for data collection. The collected data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL (SPSS version 16). The criteria proposed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV TR) were used to diagnose PMS. From the total population size of 608; a sample size of 258 was drawn. Age of the study participants ranged from 18 to 25 years, with mean age of 20.86 ± 1.913 years. Among the participants, 144(83.2%) have had at least one PM symptoms with their menstrual period. The prevalence of PMS according to DSM-IV was 37.0%. About 49(28.3%) reported frequent class missing, 17(9.8%) exam missing, 14(8.1%) low grade scoring and 3(1.7%) of them reported withdrawal from their learning associated with their PMS. Only 83(48.0%) participants sought medical treatment for their PMS. The treatment modalities used were pain killers, 63(36.4%), hot drinks like coffee and tea, 13(7.5%), and massage therapy and exercise, 7(4.0%). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed average length of one cycle of menstruation (COR = 0.20(0.070-0.569) and academic performance impairment (AOR = 0.345(0.183-0.653) were significantly associated with the diagnosis of PMS and use of PMS treatments respectively.

Gender-Specific Attitudes of Internal Medicine Residents Toward Gastroenterology.,"Female representation among gastroenterology (GI) fellows has remained around 30%, yet women comprise over 50% of internal medicine (IM) residents. We aim to identify the gender-specific barriers of IM residents toward pursuing GI. We surveyed IM residents in the Northeast by emailing 168 IM programs a survey link to be distributed to their residents. A 4-point Likert barrier scale and bivariate analysis were performed with ""yes"" and ""no,"" where ""yes"" was analyzed as ""somewhat of a barrier"" and above. Females received a third table assessing female-specific barriers. Significance was set at < 0.05. Of 215 survey responses, 56.3% (n = 121) were female. Response rate could not be determined due to resident identity protection and inconsistent responses of survey dissemination from programs. Females had significantly greater concerns about fertility, maternity leave, radiation exposure, work-life balance, stress, and burnout compared to males (p < 0.05). For females, 48.7% felt a lack of gender diversity in GI, 54.6% felt a lack of female GI mentors, and 43.7% felt there is a lack of respect as a female in GI. No gender differences existed in motivation to pursue GI, exposure to GI, and access to GI mentors, or GI-related research. Our study reveals that female IM trainees had greater concerns surrounding fertility, radiation exposure, and maternity leave compared to male IM trainees. Lack of gender diversity and lack of female GI mentors were noted barriers for female IM trainees. Addressing these barriers may help increase female representation in GI.",['Advani R; Arjonilla M; Guerson A; Taub E; Monzur F'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35596822,female representation among gastroenterology fellows has remained around 30%. females comprise over 50% of internal medicine (IM) residents. we surveyed 168 IM programs by emailing 168 IM programs a survey link.
"Assessment of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Menstrual Hygiene Management Among Adolescent Schoolgirls (10-19 Years) in the Saurashtra Region, Gujarat.","Background Menstrual health management proves pivotal for the adoption of hygienic practices and the embracement of womanhood from the onset of menarche. Menstrual hygiene is pivotal yet under-addressed among adolescent girls in India. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding menstrual hygiene and influencing factors. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 361 adolescent schoolgirls aged 10-19 years in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat using a pretested questionnaire. Multistage sampling was used. In the first stage, six schools (three rural and three urban) were selected through random sampling. In the second stage, all adolescent girls aged 10-19 years in the selected schools who had attained menarche were invited to participate. Those who provided written assent were included in the study. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Knowledge about menstruation was evenly distributed as good (47.65%) and poor (52.35%). Most relied on mothers for information and considered menstruation a normal phenomenon. Attitudes reflected complex cultural perceptions. The use of sanitary pads was high (96.12%), although 39.89% used reused absorbents. Multivariate analysis revealed age 16-19 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-3.81), higher parental education, pit latrine usage (AOR = 6.7, 95% CI = 2.97-15.15), and knowledge about menstruation (AOR = 8.21, 95% CI = 4.56-14.78) as positive predictors of good menstrual practices. Conclusions Despite the widespread use of sanitary pads, the persisting knowledge gap and sociocultural influences lead to unhygienic practices. Improving awareness and attitudes through educational interventions among adolescent girls and mothers, in particular, addressing cultural taboos through the engagement of all stakeholders, and improving sanitation infrastructure in schools are imperative.",['M Y; Trivedi NS; Damor R; Patel M; Ladani H; Ramachandran A; Vamja R; Surati B'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38249235,"menstrual hygiene is pivotal yet under-addressed among adolescent girls in india. study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding menstrual hygiene."
Understanding period poverty and stigma: Highlighting the need for improved public health initiatives and provider awareness.,"Period poverty affects millions of people who menstruate, but there is limited research to fully understand the scope and impact. Societal stigmas and cultural taboos negatively affect menstruation, a natural, biologic process. When unable to afford or find appropriate menstrual products, individuals may resort to alternative, poorer quality items, which increase their risk of infections. In addition, lack of products may cause individuals to miss events and have negative emotions. Implicit sexism and gender inequality are notable through the high cost of essential period products. Uncomfortable environments prevent patients from openly discussing menstruation with health care providers, who may lack training to competently assess needs and address barriers. Period poverty is a public health issue that not only needs to be addressed by our health care providers but also through increased education in schools and changes in local and federal legislation. In this paper, we discuss the financial, physical, and mental health impacts of period poverty and describe our experience creating a period pantry at a free medical clinic.",['Miller TA; Farley M; Reji J; Obeidi Y; Kelley V; Herbert M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37863396,"period poverty affects millions of menstruate, but there is limited research to fully understand the scope and impact. sexism and gender inequality are notable through the high cost of essential period products."
The role of borderline personality disorder traits in predicting longitudinal variability of major depressive symptoms among a sample of depressed adults.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) often co-occur, with 20 % of adults with MDD meeting criteria for BPD. While MDD is typically diagnosed by symptoms persisting for several weeks, research suggests a dynamic pattern of symptom changes occurring over shorter durations. Given the diagnostic focus on affective states in MDD and BPD, with BPD characterized by instability, we expected heightened instability of MDD symptoms among depressed adults with BPD traits. The current study examined whether BPD symptoms predicted instability in depression symptoms, measured by ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). The sample included 207 adults with MDD (76 % White, 82 % women) recruited from across the United States. At the start of the study, participants completed a battery of mental health screens including BPD severity and neuroticism. Participants completed EMAs tracking their depression symptoms three times a day over a 90-day period. Using self-report scores assessing borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits along with neuroticism scores and sociodemographic data, Bayesian and frequentist linear regression models consistently indicated that BPD severity was not associated with depression symptom change through time. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity may be restricted by use of a self-report screening tool for capturing BPD severity. Additionally, this clinical sample of depressed adults lacks a comparison group to determine whether subclinical depressive symptoms present differently among individuals with BPD only. The unexpected findings shed light on the interplay between these disorders, emphasizing the need for further research to understand their association.",['Kline EA; Lekkas D; Bryan A; Nemesure MD; Griffin TZ; Collins AC; Price GD; Heinz MV; Nepal S; Pillai A; Campbell AT; Jacobson NC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39029689,borderline personality disorder traits predict longitudinal variability of major depressive symptoms. 20 % of adults with MDD meeting criteria for BPD.
Encapsulated stretchable amphibious strain sensors.,"Soft and stretchable strain sensors have found wide applications in health monitoring, motion tracking, and robotic sensing. There is a growing demand for strain sensors in amphibious environments, such as implantable sensors, wearable sensors for swimmers/divers, and underwater robotic sensors. However, developing a sensitive, stretchable, and robust amphibious strain sensor remains challenging. This work presents an encapsulated stretchable amphibious strain sensor. The conductive layer, made of silver nanowires embedded below the surface of polydimethylsiloxane, was sandwiched by two layers of thermoplastic polyurethane. Periodic sharp cuts were introduced to change the direction of flow from across the sensor to along the conductive path defined by the opening cracks. The crack advancing and opening is controlled by a unique combination of weak/strong interfaces within the sandwich structure. The cut design and the interfacial interactions between the layers were investigated. The strain sensor exhibited a high gauge factor up to 289, a linear sensing response, a fast response time (53 ms), excellent robustness against over-strain, and stability after 16 000 loading cycles and 20 days in an aqueous saline solution. The functionality of this amphibious strain sensor was demonstrated by tracking the motion of a robotic fish, undertaking language recognition underwater, and monitoring the blood pressure of a porcine aorta. This illustrates the promising potential for this strain sensor for both underwater use and surgically implantable applications.",['Wu S; Kim D; Tang X; King MW; Zhu Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105300,"strain sensors have found wide applications in health monitoring, motion tracking, and robotic sensing. there is a growing demand for strain sensors in amphibious environments."
Experiences of smoking and tobacco use during pregnancy: A qualitative study protocol.,"Tobacco use during pregnancy is the main avoidable cause of morbidity and mortality both for pregnant women and their offspring. Between 12 and 22% of pregnant women in industrialized countries smoke during pregnancy, and 13% are unable to stop smoking. Pregnancy is considered an ideal opportunity to intervene and control tobacco use among smokers and their families. However, pregnant women experience barriers to quitting smoking, including social stigma and fear of being judged. Thus, it is necessary to develop interventions for smoking cessation adapted for pregnant women. This paper presents a qualitative study protocol to assess the barriers and facilitators of smoking cessation during pregnancy that female smokers encounter or perceive. It consists of a series of focus groups and individual interviews with female smokers who have been pregnant within the last five years. Participants will be recruited from the Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Services of the Camp de Tarragona. A group of 5-10 women who have been pregnant and tried to quit smoking over the last 5 years will be selected. The data will be collected by means of semistructured interviews. All interviews will be transcribed verbatim, coded and synthesized into categories and main themes. Thematic analysis will be conducted employing an iterative and reflexive approach. The results of this study will offer new perspectives on smoking interventions for pregnant women and enhance our comprehension of the main barriers to and facilitators of smoking cessation during pregnancy. This will contribute to the adaptation of the Tobbstop app, originally designed for the general public, to suit the needs of pregnant women. Consequently, the creation of targeted interventions will positively influence the health outcomes of both pregnant women and newborns. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT05222958.

Measurement of changes to the menstrual cycle: A transdisciplinary systematic review evaluating measure quality and utility for clinical trials.,"Despite the importance of menstruation and the menstrual cycle to health, human rights, and sociocultural and economic wellbeing, the study of menstrual health suffers from a lack of funding, and research remains fractured across many disciplines. We sought to systematically review validated approaches to measure four aspects of changes to the menstrual cycle-bleeding, blood, pain, and perceptions-caused by any source and used within any field. We then evaluated the measure quality and utility for clinical trials of the identified instruments. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and four instrument databases and included peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2023 that reported on the development or validation of instruments assessing menstrual changes using quantitative or mixed-methods methodology. From a total of 8,490 articles, 8,316 were excluded, yielding 174 articles reporting on 94 instruments. Almost half of articles were from the United States or United Kingdom and over half of instruments were only in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese. Most instruments measured bleeding parameters, uterine pain, or perceptions, but few assessed characteristics of blood. Nearly 60% of instruments were developed for populations with menstrual or gynecologic disorders or symptoms. Most instruments had fair or good measure quality or clinical trial utility; however, most instruments lacked evidence on responsiveness, question sensitivity and/or transferability, and only three instruments had good scores of both quality and utility. Although we took a novel, transdisciplinary approach, our systematic review found important gaps in the literature and instrument landscape, pointing towards a need to examine the menstrual cycle in a more comprehensive, inclusive, and standardized way. Our findings can inform the development of new or modified instruments, which-if used across the many fields that study menstrual health and within clinical trials-can contribute to a more systemic and holistic understanding of menstruation and the menstrual cycle.",['Mackenzie ACL; Chung S; Hoppes E; Mickler AK; Cartwright AF'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052601,"transdisciplinary systematic review evaluating measure quality and utility for clinical trials of identified instruments. despite the importance of menstruation and the menstrual cycle to health, human rights, and sociocultural and economic wellbeing, the study of menstrual health suffers from a lack of funding."
Potential factors contributing to observed sex differences in virtual-reality-induced sickness.,"Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely adopted for several professional and recreational applications. Despite rapid innovation in hardware and software, one of the long prevailing issues for end users of VR is the experience of VR sickness. Females experience stronger VR sickness compared to males, and previous research has linked susceptibility to VR sickness to the menstrual cycle (Munafo et al., Exp Brain Res 235(3):889-901). Here we investigated the female versus male experience in VR sickness while playing an immersive VR game, comparing days of the menstrual cycle when hormones peak: day 15 (ovulation-peak estrogen) and day 22 (mid-luteal phase-peak progesterone). We found that immersion duration was greater in the second session than the first, and discomfort was lessened, suggesting a powerful adaptation with repeated exposure. Due to the estrogen levels changing along with the exposure, there was no clear independent impact of that; note, though, that there was a significant difference between self-report and physiological measures implying that GSR is potentially an unreliable measure of motion sickness. Although prior work found a delay over 2 days between session would not allow adaptation and habituation to reduce VR sickness susceptibility, we found that a week delay has potential success.",['Bannigan GM; de Sousa AA; Scheller M; Finnegan DJ; Proulx MJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38170233,females experience stronger VR sickness compared to males. previous research has linked susceptibility to VR sickness to the menstrual cycle.

A microbial metabolite inhibits the HIF-2α-ceramide pathway to mediate the beneficial effects of time-restricted feeding on MASH.,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a potent dietary intervention for improving metabolic diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH). However, the mechanism of this efficacy has remained elusive. Here, we show that TRF improves MASLD, which is associated with a significant enrichment of Ruminococcus torques (R. torques). Mechanistically, R. torques suppresses the intestinal HIF-2α-ceramide pathway via the production of 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid (HMP). We identify rtMor as a 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate reductase that synthesizes HMP in R. torques. Finally, we show that either the colonization of R. torques or oral HMP supplementation can ameliorate inflammation and fibrosis in a MASH mouse model. These findings identify R. torques and HMP as potential TRF mimetics for the treatment of metabolic disorders.",['Zhang Y; Wang X; Lin J; Liu J; Wang K; Nie Q; Ye C; Sun L; Ma Y; Qu R; Mao Y; Zhang X; Lu H; Xia P; Zhao D; Wang G; Zhang Z; Fu W; Jiang C; Pang Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39079531,time-restricted feeding is a potent dietary intervention for improving metabolic diseases. this includes metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. but the mechanism of this efficacy has remained elusive.
Long-term cardiovascular outcomes and mortality with enzyme replacement therapy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II.,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is a rare multisystemic lysosomal disorder in which cardiac issues can lead to serious dysfunction and an increased risk of fatal cardiac failure. However, studies on major adverse cardiac event (MACE) outcomes in MPS II are lacking. This study evaluated the cardiovascular outcomes and impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with MPS II in South Korea. In this national cohort study, utilizing data from the National Health Insurance Database, we evaluated 127 patients with MPS II over a 14-year period to investigate the effects of ERT on MACE and all-cause mortality. We tracked MACE incidence, defined by hospitalizations for cardiovascular events, from diagnosis and adjusted the hazard ratios for MACE using Cox modeling. Over an average follow-up period of 7.3 years, we identified 16 cases of MACE among patients (17.35 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval, 10.74-26.83). Patients receiving ERT exhibited a significantly lower incidence of MACE than untreated patients, with cumulative incidences showing a marked difference of 8.3 years. Notably, initiating ERT at earlier stages post-diagnosis was associated with improved outcomes, underscoring the importance of timely treatment. The key risk factors for MACE included specific arrhythmias, a history of invasive procedures, and depression. Early ERT significantly reduced MACE risk and increased survival in patients with MPS II. This underscores the importance of prompt treatment initiation and comprehensive care to address key risk factors and advocates for an expanded therapeutic strategy to enhance MPS II outcomes.",['Kwak JH; Choi YJ; Kim S; Yang A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39076005,"mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is a rare multisystemic lysosomal disorder. cardiac issues can lead to serious dysfunction and an increased risk of fatal cardiac failure. however, studies on major adverse cardiac event outcomes in MPS II are lacking."
Extended cycling or continuous use of hormonal contraceptives for female adolescents.,"The purpose of this review is to present the most recent data on extended cycling and continuous use of hormonal contraception for female adolescents. Since 2003, several new products have been US Food and Drug Administration approved to provide extended cycling or continuous use of hormonal contraception. Clinical trials have been conducted with adult women of 18 years and older and not with adolescents under age of 18 years. Studies find successful menstrual suppression using extended cycling and continuous-use regimens that are safe and effective without negative effects on the endometrium or hemostasis. Extended cycling and continuous use improves menstrual symptoms attributed to the hormone-free interval in traditional cyclic regimens. Adolescent health providers report prescribing extended cycles of contraception with increasing frequency to adolescents. It is unknown how well female adolescents tolerate breakthrough bleeding, but data suggest that bleeding is the main reason for discontinuing. Supplementation with intermittent estrogen or instituting a 4-day hormone-free interval in response to persistent bleeding may decrease this side effect; adolescents should be counseled about these options. Extended cycling or continuous use of hormonal contraception offers adolescents an opportunity to decrease, delay or suppress monthly menstruation for health or personal reasons.",['Gold MA; Duffy K'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19528798,the purpose of this review is to present the most recent data on extended cycling or continuous use of hormonal contraception for female adolescents. the study found successful menstrual suppression using extended cycling and continuous-use regimens that are safe and effective without negative effects on the endometrium or hemostasis.
Reproductive health and hemostatic issues in women and girls with congenital factor VII deficiency: A systematic review.,"Congenital factor VII (FVII) deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder, with heterogenous bleeding symptoms. Women with FVII deficiency face hemostatic challenges during menstruation, ovulation, and childbirth. This systematic review evaluated prevalence and management of bleeding symptoms associated with gynecological and obstetric issues in women with FVII deficiency. Databases (BIOSIS Previews, Current Contents Search, Embase, and MEDLINE) were searched for studies reporting FVII deficiency and gynecological or obstetric issues in women. Articles were screened using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists and relevant data extracted. One hundred fourteen women were identified from 62 publications. Forty-six women had severe deficiency (FVII:C < 5% or <5 IU/dl). Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) was the most common bleeding symptom (n = 94; 82%); hospitalization and urgent medical/surgical interventions for acute HMB episodes were required in 16 women (14%). Seven women reported ovarian bleeding (6%); other bleeding symptoms varied. Patient management was inconsistent and included hemostatic and hormonal treatments. Only four women (7%) reporting vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) occurred following 12/45 deliveries (27%; 5 [42%] requiring blood transfusion) and was not necessarily prevented by prophylaxis (8 women). Women with congenital FVII deficiency have an increased risk of HMB, ovarian bleeding, and PPH, impacting quality of life. Recognition of a bleeding disorder as the cause is often delayed. Management of bleeding complications is heterogeneous due to lack of treatment guidelines. Harmonizing severity classification of FVII deficiency may help standardize treatment strategies and development of specific guidelines for these women.",['Abdul-Kadir R; Gomez K'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36073900,"women with congenital factor VII deficiency face hemostatic challenges during menstruation, ovulation, and childbirth. systematic review evaluated prevalence and management of bleeding symptoms associated with gynecological and obstetric issues in women."

Nomogram prediction for periodontitis in Chinese pregnant women with different sociodemographic and oral health behavior characteristics: a community-based study.,"Periodontitis is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, indicating periodontal health as an important health concern for pregnant women. Herein, this study identified risk indicators for periodontitis and developed a nomogram for predicting the risk of periodontitis in pregnancy by analyzing periodontitis and associated factors in pregnant women. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted by including 438 pregnant women at 10-36 gestational weeks from Langfang, China. Pregnant women were examined for periodontal status, and their demographic, socioeconomic, and oral health behavior data were collected. Potential influencing factors of periodontitis were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A nomogram was developed, followed by the assessment of its validation and discriminatory abilities. The prevalence of periodontitis was 59.8% in pregnant women. Periodontitis-associated variables in pregnant women were gestational age, non-first pregnancy, daily tooth brushing frequency of ≤ 1 before pregnancy, and annual frequency of periodontal treatment < 1 (including no periodontal treatment). The risk of periodontitis was positively associated with gestational age (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.17-1.39, p < 0.001). Pregnancy history showed a strong positive association (OR = 6.57, 95% CI = 1.22-35.43, p = 0.03). Daily tooth brushing frequency before pregnancy was also positively associated with periodontitis (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.03-2.79, p = 0.05). Additionally, the annual frequency of periodontal treatment exhibited a positive association, with higher odds observed for those with less frequent treatment (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.25-4.14, p = 0.05; OR = 7.37, 95% CI = 3.04-22.06, p < 0.001). These four factors were used to develop a nomogram for predicting periodontitis in pregnant women. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.855 and 0.831 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively, reflecting the superior prediction accuracy of the nomogram. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis demonstrated the good performance and net benefit of the nomogram. Risk factors for periodontitis in pregnant Chinese women include gestational age, non-first pregnancy, lower frequency of daily tooth brushing before pregnancy, and lower frequency of periodontal treatment. An easy-to-use nomogram with acceptable accuracy can allow for the prediction of periodontitis risk in pregnant Chinese women. With the assistance of this nomogram, clinicians can evaluate the risk of periodontitis in pregnancy, thereby offering more tailored oral health education to women of reproductive age.",['Shi Q; Cai Y; Wang X; Liu G; Luan Q'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39098909,periodontitis is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. periodontitis is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. a nomogram was developed for predicting the risk of periodontitis in pregnancy.
A Comparative Study of Luteinizing Hormone Levels in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome With Hyperandrogenism: Metformin Versus Oral Contraceptive Pills.,"Introduction The primary objective of the study was to compare the serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in patients with hyperandrogenism on metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills. Secondarily, the study also assessed the serum testosterone, body mass index (BMI), and the time to achieve regular menstruation were also assessed. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences (LUMHS) between June 1, 2019 and May 30, 2020. A total of 200 women fulfilling the clinical and biochemical criteria for the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) were enrolled, 100 in each group. Considering the inclusion criteria, the patients were picked up from the gynecology outpatient department. After taking a detailed history and physical, abdominal, and pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasonography along with biochemical evaluations of serum LH and testosterone were done in selected patients. Metformin was started at an oral dose of 500 mg daily and maintained at 1500 mg for six months in group A, and oral contraceptive pills were given for a period of six months in group B. Besides body weight and hirsutism, serum LH levels, serum prolactin levels, and serum testosterone levels were performed at the start of the treatment and then repeated after three months and after six months. After six months of menstrual cyclicity, changes in serum LH levels and body weights were assessed in the two groups and the rate of conception in the Metformin group. Results A total of 200 women were enrolled and equally divided into metformin and oral contraceptive groups. Follow-up revealed that a significantly higher number of patients achieved regular menstruation in the metformin group as compared to the oral contraceptive groups (p = 0.03). In the metformin group, 72 patients achieved regular menses, while in the oral contraceptive groups, about 58 patients achieved regular menstruation. Both metformin and oral contraceptive therapy were effective in improving patient outcomes in terms of serum LH, testosterone levels, and BMI. However, metformin had considerably higher rates of improvement as compared to oral contraceptive group patients. The mean serum LH level decreased from 38 mIU/ml to 17.6 mIU/ml in the metformin group (p < 0.0001), while the mean serum LH level reduced from 37.5 mIU/ml to 27.7 mIU/ml in the oral contraceptive group (p < 0.01). The change in serum testosterone level after six months was 2.98 ± 0.75 in the metformin group (p < 0.001) and 1.50 ± 0.64 in the oral contraceptive group (p < 0.01). Conclusion We revealed that both metformin and oral contraceptives are effective in improving symptomatology in PCOS patients. However, a significantly higher number of patients achieved normal menses with metformin than with oral contraceptives. Moreover, metformin had considerably higher rates of improvements in serum LH levels and serum testosterone levels as compared to oral contraceptive group patients.",['Fattah A; Al-Kader DA; Jones Amaowei EE; Amini H; Hewadmal H; Rasuli SF; Ikedum IV; Farooq J; Bashar M; Qadar LT'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36299963,"metformin was started at 500 mg daily and maintained at 1500 mg for six months in group A. oral contraceptive pills were given for a period of six months in group B. a total of 200 women fulfilling clinical and biochemical criteria for the polycystic ovarian syndrome were enrolled, 100 in each group."
Physical and Psychological Symptoms Associated With Premenstrual Syndrome and Their Impact on the Daily Routine of Women in a Low Socioeconomic Status Locality.,"Introduction The constellation of the physical and psychological symptoms that appear several days before menstrual period is regarded as the premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The current study evaluated the symptoms associated with PMS and their impact on the day-to-day activities of women. Methodology An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at a squatter settlement in Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2019 to February 2020. Amenorrheic, pregnant women, and women who were on birth control at the time of data collection were excluded from the study. The demographics, symptoms of PMS experienced by the participants, and the impact of PMS symptoms on the daily lives of women were recorded. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v.25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data analysis.  Results The mean age ± standard deviation of 23.93 years ± 9.41 years was recorded. As many as 213 (63%) women reported dysmenorrhea, followed by fatigue in 108 (32%), bloating in 64 (18.9%), and back pain in 45 (13.3%) women. Irritability and anxiety were experienced by 134 (39.6%) and 117 (34.6%) women, respectively. When asked about their attitude and perception towards menstruation, more than four-fifth respondents confessed that they feel impure when they are experiencing their monthly period. About 38 women (11.2%) believed that menstruation is God's way of punishing the womankind. For the question, ""Do you feel that your normal routine is significantly disturbed during your period?"", 40% responded in affirmation. Conclusion The findings of the current study reflected a generally negative attitude towards menstruation, which significantly affected the routine lives of women in our setting. The study further concluded that dysmenorrhea, fatigue, irritability, and anxiety were the most common symptoms of PMS experienced by women.",['Abbas K; Usman G; Ahmed M; Qazi R; Asghar A; Masood Shah A; Rizvi A; Abid K; Haq KU; Tahir A; Usama SM'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173629,the constellation of the physical and psychological symptoms that appear several days before menstrual period is regarded as the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) the current study evaluated the symptoms associated with PMS and their impact on the day-to-day activities of women.
Sexism in the management of bleeding disorders.,"Sexism has been an issue in bleeding disorders for centuries. Women with bleeding disorders have been underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Those who are diagnosed often experience delays in diagnosis and feel that their symptoms are dismissed or minimized. Several factors contribute to this sexism. Historically, the clinical and research focus within the bleeding disorder community has been on men and hemophilia. Von Willebrand disease, a disease that has long been recognized as affecting women, is much more common than hemophilia, yet has significantly fewer resources devoted to it. The lack of knowledge and comfort that patients and health care providers have regarding menstruation compounds the issue, as heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common symptoms seen in women with bleeding disorders. Stemming from the universal stigmatization of periods, this lack of comfort and knowledge results in fewer women seeking care, fewer health care providers addressing the issue, and fewer women getting the care they deserve. Progress has been made, with many organizations dedicating resources to improving the care of these women. The road is long, and much more work is needed to ensure that women with bleeding disorders receive the care they deserve.",['Weyand AC; James PD'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33537529,women with bleeding disorders have been underrecognized and underdiagnosed. those who are diagnosed often experience delays in diagnosis.
Progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for uterine fibroids (other than preoperative medical therapy).,"Uterine fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Medical treatments are considered to preserve fertility. It is unclear whether progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems can reduce fibroid-related symptoms. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. To determine the effectiveness of progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems in treating premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases to July 2020. We also searched trials registers for ongoing and registered trials, and checked references of relevant trials. All identified published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems in treating premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. This updated review included four studies with 221 women with uterine fibroids. The evidence was very low quality, downgraded for serious risk of bias, due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS) versus hysterectomy There was no information on the outcomes of interest, including adverse events. LNG-IUS versus low dose combined oral contraceptive (COC) At 12 months, we are uncertain whether LNG-IUS reduced the percentage of abnormal uterine bleeding, measured with the alkaline hematin test (mean difference (MD) 77.50%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 70.44 to 84.56; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-quality evidence), or the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC; MD 34.50%, 95% CI 11.59 to 57.41; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-quality evidence); increased haemoglobin levels (MD 1.50 g/dL, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.15; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-quality evidence), or reduced fibroid size more than COC (MD 1.90%, 95% CI -12.24 to 16.04; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-quality evidence). The study did not measure adverse events. LNG-IUS versus oral progestogen (norethisterone acetate (NETA)) Compared to NETA, we are uncertain whether LNG-IUS reduced abnormal uterine bleeding more from baseline to six months (visual bleeding score; MD 23.75 points, 95% CI 1.26 to 46.24; 1 RCT, 45 women; very low-quality evidence); increased the percentage of change in haemoglobin from baseline to three months (MD 4.53%, 95% CI 1.46 to 7.60; 1 RCT, 48 women; very low-quality evidence), or from baseline to six months (MD 10.14%, 95% CI 5.57 to 14.71; 1 RCT, 45 women; very low-quality evidence). The study did not measure fibroid size. Spotting (adverse event) was more likely to be reported by women with the LNG-IUS (64.3%) than by those taking NETA (30%; 1 RCT, 45 women; very low-quality evidence). Oral progestogen (dienogest, desogestrel) versus goserelin acetate Compared to goserelin acetate, we are uncertain whether abnormal uterine bleeding was reduced at 12 weeks with dienogest (PBAC; MD 216.00 points, 95% CI 149.35 to 282.65; 1 RCT, 14 women; very low-quality evidence) or desogestrel (PBAC; MD 78.00 points, 95% CI 28.94 to 127.06; 1 RCT, 16 women; very low-quality evidence). Vasomotor symptoms (adverse events, e.g. hot flashes) are only associated with goserelin acetate (55%), not with dienogest (1 RCT, 14 women; very low-quality evidence) or with desogestrel (1 RCT, 16 women; very low-quality evidence). The study did not report fibroid size. Because of very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the LNG-IUS reduces abnormal uterine bleeding or increases haemoglobin levels in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids, compared to COC or norethisterone acetate. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the LNG-IUS reduces the size of uterine fibroids compared to COC. We are uncertain whether oral progestogens reduce abnormal uterine bleeding as effectively as goserelin acetate, but women reported fewer adverse events, such as hot flashes.",['Sangkomkamhang US; Lumbiganon P; Pattanittum P'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33226133,progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems can reduce fibroid-related symptoms. it is unclear whether progestogens or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems can reduce fibroid-related symptoms.
Lesion Genotype Modifies High-Fat Diet Effects on Endometriosis Development in Mice.,"Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent gynecologic disorder that affects reproductive-aged women and to a lesser extent, post-menopausal women on hormone therapy. The condition is associated with systemic and local immune dysfunctions. While its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, endometriosis has a genetic component and propensity for the disease is subject to environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle influences. Previously, we showed that high-fat diet (HFD) increased ectopic lesion numbers, concurrent with systemic and peritoneal changes in inflammatory and oxidative stress status, in immunocompetent recipient mice <i>ip</i> administered with endometrial fragments null for Krüppel-like factor 9 gene. Herein, we determined whether HFD modifies lesion parameters, when recipient peritoneal environment is challenged with ectopic wild-type (WT) endometrial fragments, the latter simulating retrograde menstruation common in women during the menstrual period. WT endometrium-recipient mice fed HFD (45% kcal from fat) showed reduced lesion incidence, numbers, and volumes, in the absence of changes in systemic ovarian steroid hormone and insulin levels, relative to those fed the control diet (CD, 17% kcal from fat). Lesions from HFD- and CD-fed recipients demonstrated comparable gene expression for steroid hormone receptors (<i>Esr</i> and <i>Pgr</i>) and cytokines (<i>Il-6, Il-8</i>, and <i>CxCL4</i>) and similar levels of DNA oxidative biomarkers. HFD moderately altered serum (3-nitrotyrosine and methionine/homocysteine) and peritoneal (reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione) pro-oxidative status but had no effect on peritoneal inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor α and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) mediators. Results indicate that lesion genotype modifies dietary effects on disease establishment and/or progression and if translated, could be important for provision of nutritional guidelines to women with predisposition to, or affected by endometriosis.",['Heard-Lipsmeyer ME; Alhallak I; Simmen FA; Melnyk SB; Simmen RCM'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34712146,"endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent gynecologic disorder. it affects reproductive-aged women and post-menopausal women on hormone therapy. the condition is associated with systemic and local immune dysfunctions."
Use of menstruation and fertility app trackers: a scoping review of the evidence.,"There has been a phenomenal worldwide increase in the development and use of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) that monitor menstruation and fertility. Critics argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and lack evidence from either clinical trials or user experience. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the research literature on mHealth apps that track menstruation and fertility. This project followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for material published between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019. Data summary and synthesis were used to chart and analyse the data. In total 654 records were reviewed. Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501 records that did not meet the inclusion criteria were removed. Eighteen records from 13 countries form the basis of this review. The papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary and methodological frameworks. Three main themes were identified: fertility and reproductive health tracking, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy prevention. Motivations for fertility app use are varied, overlap and change over time, although women want apps that are accurate and evidence-based regardless of whether they are tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or using the app as a form of contraception. There is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the development, evaluation, usage and regulation of fertility and menstruation apps. The paucity of evidence-based research and absence of fertility, health professionals and users in studies is raised.",['Earle S; Marston HR; Hadley R; Banks D'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32253280,mHealth apps track menstruation and fertility. critics argue many of the apps are inaccurate. the aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the research literature.
"Preconception care use and associated factors among HIV positive reproductive age women attending ART clinics at public hospitals in the Hadiya zone, southern Ethiopia: a mixed method approach.","Globally, the HIV pandemic makes preconception care even more crucial due to the additional risks for sexual and vertical transmission of HIV. However, there is limited evidence on the utilization of preconception care among high-risk women in Ethiopia. The purpose of this research is to assess preconception care utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive women of reproductive age who attend ART clinics in public hospitals in the Hadiya zone of Southern Ethiopia in 2023. A cross-sectional study design employing a mixed methods approach was used among 297 study participants from July 1-Semptember 1, 2022. Data were collected by pretested structured questionnaires. The data were analyzed by SPSS statistical software version 25. Logistic regression, Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was computed, and variables with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Qualitative data were analyzed using open code version 4.03. This study revealed that 19.9% (95%Cl: 15.4, 24.2) of study participants use preconception care. Women's autonomy (AOR = 3.65; 95% CI: 1.14, 11.68;P = 0.03), knowledge of PCC (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13, 8.22; P = 0.001), getting family/husband support (AOR = 4.06; 95% CI: 1.56, 10.53;P = 0.022), discussions with healthcare providers (AOR = 5.60; 95% CI: 2.26, 13.90;P = 0.002), availability of room for PCC (AOR = 3.77; 95% CI: 1.38, 10.31;P = 0.009), getting all laboratory services (AOR = 4.19; 95% CI: 1.61, 10.94; P = 0.002), and history of medical problems (AOR = 2.94; 95% CI: 11.01, 8.62;P = 0.036) were significantly associated with PCC use. The level of PCC use in the current study area is low. Women's autonomy, knowledge of PCC, obtaining support from family or husband, engaging in discussions with healthcare providers, having access to a PCC room, access to all laboratory services, and having a history of medical problems are significantly associated with PCC use. Our findings suggest integrating PCC into routine HIV care, boosting women's autonomy, and integrating family support with healthcare providers.",['Fikire B; Sedoro T; Hasen H; Mekango DE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103818,"mixed methods approach was used among 297 study participants. data were collected by pretested structured questionnaires. women's autonomy (AOR = 3.65; 95% CI: 1.14, 11.68;P = 0.03), knowledge of PCC (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13, 8.22; P = 0.001), getting family/husband support (AOR = 4.06; 95% CI: 1.13, 8.22; P = 0.001)"
Molecular characterization of the circadian clock in patients with Parkinson's disease-CLOCK4PD Study protocol.,"Circadian rhythms (CRs) orchestrate intrinsic 24-hour oscillations which synchronize an organism's physiology and behaviour with respect to daily cycles. CR disruptions have been linked to Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, and are associated to several PD-symptoms such as sleep disturbances. Studying molecular changes of CR offers a potential avenue for unravelling novel insights into the PD progression, symptoms, and can be further used for optimization of treatment strategies. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of the alterations at the molecular expression level for core-clock and clock-controlled genes in PD is still missing. The proposed study protocol will be used to characterize expression profiles of circadian genes obtained from saliva samples in PD patients and controls. For this purpose, 20 healthy controls and 70 PD patients will be recruited. Data from clinical assessment, questionnaires, actigraphy tracking and polysomnography will be collected and clinical evaluations will be repeated as a follow-up in one-year time. We plan to carry out sub-group analyses considering several clinical factors (e.g., biological sex, treatment dosages, or fluctuation of symptoms), and to correlate reflected changes in CR of measured genes with distinct PD phenotypes (diffuse malignant and mild/motor-predominant). Additionally, using NanoStringⓇ multiplex technology on a subset of samples, we aim to further explore potential CR alterations in hundreds of genes involved in neuropathology pathways. CLOCK4PD is a mono-centric, non-interventional observational study aiming at the molecular characterization of CR alterations in PD. We further plan to determine physiological modifications in sleep and activity patterns, and clinical factors correlating with the observed CR changes. Our study may provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between CR and PD with a potential to be used as a predictor of circadian alterations reflecting distinct disease phenotypes, symptoms, and progression outcomes.",['Yalçin M; Peralta AR; Bentes C; Silva C; Guerreiro T; Ferreira JJ; Relógio A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39028707,a comprehensive characterization of the alterations at the molecular expression level for core-clock and clock-controlled genes in PD is still missing. the proposed study protocol will be used to characterize expression profiles of circadian genes obtained from saliva samples in PD patients and controls.
Measurement of Physical Activity Using Fitness Trackers Before and After Midurethral Sling.,"Urinary incontinence can be a barrier to performing physical activities for many women. A midurethral sling (MUS) has shown symptom improvement for women experiencing stress urinary incontinence (SUI), suggesting the hypothesis that physical activity rates should increase after treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the change in objectively measured physical activity levels in women following placement of MUS for SUI. In this prospective cohort study, patients undergoing MUS placement, with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive surgery, were provided a commercial activity tracker. Physical activity was tracked for at least 1 week preoperatively and up to 6 months postoperatively. Participants were required to wear the tracker for at least 2 weeks in the postoperative period. The primary outcome, mean caloric daily expenditure (MCDE), was compared preoperatively and postoperatively. Seventy-two patients met criteria for data inclusion. The device was worn for a mean of 18.4 ± 12.1 days preoperatively and 91.7 ± 53.3 days postoperatively. Mean participant age was 51.9 ± 9.4 years. The MCDE was significantly higher postoperatively (preoperatively: 1,673 kcal/d vs postoperatively: 2,018 kcal/d; P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in postoperative MCDE in participants who had only MUS as the primary procedure versus participants who also had a concomitant procedure (2,020 ± 216 kcal/d vs 2,015 ± 431 kcal/d; P = 0.95). Of participants with class II/III obesity, 45% had at least a 500 kcal/d increase postoperatively. Treatment of SUI with MUS is associated with a significantly greater caloric expenditure in the postoperative period.",['Cope ZS; Stewart JR; Gupta A; Hobson DTG; Warehime J; Feroz R; Scheidel S; Meriwether KV; Lenger SM; Gaskins JT; Sumy S; Francis S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38954609,a midurethral sling (MUS) has shown symptom improvement for women experiencing stress urinary incontinence (SUI) the aim of this study was to determine the change in objectively measured physical activity levels in women following placement of MUS for SUI.
Effects of menstrual cycle on hemodynamic and autonomic responses to central hypovolemia.,"Estrogen and progesterone levels undergo changes throughout the menstrual cycle. Existing literature regarding the effect of menstrual phases on cardiovascular and autonomic regulation during central hypovolemia is contradictory. This study aims to explore the influence of menstrual phases on cardiovascular and autonomic responses in both resting and during the central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). This is a companion paper, in which data across the menstrual phases from healthy young females, whose results are reported in Shankwar et al. (2023), were further analysed. The study protocol consisted of three phases: (1) 30 min of supine rest; (2) 16 min of four LBNP levels; and (3) 5 min of supine recovery. Hemodynamic and autonomic responses (assessed via heart rate variability, HRV) were measured before-, during-, and after-LBNP application using Task Force Monitor® (CNSystems, Graz, Austria). Blood was also collected to measure estrogen and progesterone levels. In this companion paper, we have exclusively assessed 14 females from the previous study (Shankwar et al., 2023): 8 in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (mean age 23.38 ± 3.58 years, height 166.00 ± 5.78 cm, weight 57.63 ± 5.39 kg and BMI of 20.92 ± 1.96 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 6 in the luteal phase (mean age 22.17 ± 1.33 years, height 169.83 ± 5.53 cm, weight 62.00 ± 7.54 kg and BMI of 21.45 ± 2.63 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Baseline estrogen levels were significantly different from the follicular phase as compared to the luteal phase: (33.59 pg/ml, 108.02 pg/ml, respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Resting hemodynamic variables showed no difference across the menstrual phases. However, females in the follicular phase showed significantly lower resting values of low-frequency (LF) band power (41.38 ± 11.75 n.u. and 58.47 ± 14.37 n.u., <i>p</i> = 0.01), but higher resting values of high frequency (HF) band power (58.62 ± 11.75 n.u. and 41.53 ± 14.37 n.u., <i>p</i> = 0.01), as compared to females in the luteal phase. During hypovolemia, the LF and HF band powers changed only in the follicular phase F(1, 7) = 77.34, <i>p</i> < 0.0001 and F(1, 7) = 520.06, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, respectively. The menstrual phase had an influence on resting autonomic variables, with higher sympathetic activity being observed during the luteal phase. Central hypovolemia leads to increased cardiovascular and autonomic responses, particularly during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, likely due to higher estrogen levels and increased sympathetic activity.",['Shankhwar V; Urvec J; Steuber B; Schmid Zalaudek K; Saloň A; Hawliczek A; Bergauer A; Aljasmi K; Abdi A; Naser A; Himeidi M; Alsuwaidi H; Du Plessis S; Alsheikh-Ali A; Kellett C; Bayoumi R; Blaber AP; Goswami N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38361585,study aims to explore the influence of menstrual phases on cardiovascular and autonomic responses during central hypovolemia. study aims to explore the influence of menstrual phases on cardiovascular and autonomic responses in both resting and during central hypovolemia.
Emergency department utilization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with sickle cell disease.,"The emergency department (ED) is a vital source of healthcare for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Prior research indicates that during the COVID-19 pandemic some individuals with SCD avoided the ED for fear of acquiring COVID-19 or delayed visiting the ED by self-management of symptoms or pain crisis at home. The purpose of the current study was to understand ED utilization rates before and during the pandemic among individuals living with SCD. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using population-based SCD surveillance systems in California, Georgia, Michigan, and Tennessee to assess the impact of the pandemic on ED utilization among people with SCD by (1) analyzing trends in monthly ED utilization from January 2019 - December 2020, with specific attention given to immediate changes at the onset of the pandemic; and (2) calculating changes in the volume of utilization by comparing the total ED visits made from March - December 2020 to the same period in 2019, both overall and by demographic characteristics. Across all states, a decline in ED utilization during the onset of the pandemic was seen, with the largest decline seen in those under age 10. By December 2020, utilization rates were higher than their lowest observed month of April 2020, but had not fully returned to pre-COVID levels. During the pandemic, ED visits in each state decreased by as much as 25%, and the number of people with any ED utilization decreased by as much as 26%. This study confirms and extends the existing literature related to the impact of the pandemic on healthcare utilization patterns in the US, in a unique population with increased healthcare needs.",['Attell BK; Plaxco AP; Zhou M; Valle J; Reeves SL; Patel PN; Latta K; Smeltzer MP; Snyder AB'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075379,the emergency department (ED) is a vital source of healthcare for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) prior research indicates that during the COVID-19 pandemic some individuals with SCD avoided the ED for fear of acquiring COVID-19 or delayed visiting the ED by self-management of symptoms or pain crisis at home.
Serum polychlorinated biphenyl levels and circulating miRNAs in non-obese women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organic lipophilic pollutants that accumulate through diet and increase with age, have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and shown to affect microRNA (miRNA) expression. This work aimed to determine if PCBs were associated with circulating miRNAs and whether there were any correlations with serum PCB/miRNA levels and hormonal changes. 29 non-obese PCOS and 29 healthy control women, with similar age and body mass index (BMI), had their serum miRNAs measured together with 7 indicator PCBs (PCB28, PCB52, PCB101, PCB118, PCB138, PCB153, PCB180) using high resolution gas chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. In the combined study cohort, four miRNAs (hsa-miR-139-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p) correlated with PCBs, but none correlated with metabolic parameters. hsa-miR-335-5p correlated with FSH. When stratified, 25 miRNAs correlated with PCBs in controls compared to only one (hsa-miR-193a-5p) in PCOS; none of these miRNAs correlated with the metabolic parameters of BMI, insulin resistance, or inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP). However, of these 25 miRNAs in controls, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-193a-5p, hsa-miR-2110 and hsa-miR-195-5p positively correlated with luteinizing hormone (LH), hsa-miR-99b-5p and hsa-miR-146b-5p correlated with estradiol, hsa-miR-193a-5p correlated with progesterone, hsa-miR-195-5p correlated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and hsa-miR-139-5p and hsa-miR-146b-5p negatively correlated with anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) (all <i>p</i><0.05). hsa-miR-193a-5p in PCOS cases correlated with estradiol. In this cohort of women, with no difference in age and BMI, and with similar PCB levels, the miRNAs correlating to PCBs associated with menstrual cycle factors in healthy menstruating controls versus the anovulatory PCOS subjects. The PCB-associated miRNAs did not correlate with non-reproductive hormonal and metabolic parameters. This suggests that PCB effects on miRNAs may result in changes to the hypothalamo-ovarian axis that may thus affect fertility.",['Brennan E; Butler AE; Drage DS; Sathyapalan T; Atkin SL'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37790603,polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. they affect microRNA expression and hormonal changes. this work aimed to determine if PCBs were associated with circulating miRNAs.
Biochemistry of the menopause.,"The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.",['Honour JW'],2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29027807,"menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. the menopause is entirely natural, but in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual."
Exploring shared triggers and potential etiopathogenesis between migraine and idiopathic/genetic epilepsy: Insights from a multicenter tertiary-based study.,"Migraine and epilepsy are two episodic disorders that share common pathophysiological mechanisms. The aim of our research was to assess the possible shared etiopathogenesis by analyzing the relations of headache, and seizure triggers, based on information obtained from a national cohort surveying the headache characteristics of 809 patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic/genetic epilepsy. Our study utilized data from a multi-center, nationwide investigation of headaches in 809 patients with idiopathic/genetic epilepsy. Out of these, 508 patients reported complaints related to any type of headache (333 Migraines, 175 Headaches of other types). In the initial phase of the study encompassing the entire sample of 809 epilepsy patients, differences in seizure triggers were assessed between the migraine group (n = 333) and the non-migraine group (n = 476). Additionally, the subsequent part of the study pertains to a subgroup of the entire patient group, namely those affected by all types of headaches (n = 508), and differences in headache triggers were assessed among migraine patients (n = 333) and those with other types of headaches (n = 175). Similar differences were observed between epilepsy patients with and without a family history of epilepsy. The most frequently reported seizure triggers in all I/GE group (n = 809) were stress (23%), sleep deprivation (22%) and fatigue (18%), respectively. The most frequently reported headache triggers in migraine patients were stress (31%), sleep deprivation (28%), and noise (26%). The occurrence of menstruation-triggered seizures in individuals with migraine and I/GE was found to be considerably higher than those without migraine. The most common triggers for seizure and headache among the individuals with a positive family history of epilepsy were determined to be light stimuli and sleep deprivation. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the overlapping triggers including sleep patterns, stress levels, and menstrual cycles, etc. and potential shared etiology of migraine and I/GE. Recognizing these connections may facilitate the development of more precise therapeutic strategies and underscore the significance of adopting a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to the management of these intricate neurological conditions. Further research is essential to explore in greater depth the shared mechanisms underpinning these associations and their implications for clinical practice.",['Türk BG; Yeni SN; Atalar AÇ; Ekizoğlu E; Gök DK; Baykan B; Özge A; Ayta S; Erdoğan FF; Taşdelen B; Velioğlu SK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38367542,"a multicenter, nationwide investigation of headaches in 809 patients. the study analyzed the relations of headache, and seizure triggers. the most frequently reported headaches were migraine patients with and without a family history of epilepsy."
Moving from ethnic exclusions to cultural safety: how is athlete ethnicity discussed in research on menstrual health in sports? A scoping review.,"This study aims to investigate how athlete ethnicity is discussed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, methodology, findings, and conclusions of research focused on menstrual health in sports science and medicine. A scoping review of sports-based research conducted on athletes related to (1) menstrual health and ethnicity, (2) how researchers include/exclude participants based on ethnicity and (3) how ethnicity is discussed. Electronic search of PubMed and ProQuest. Articles were included if they met the following criteria: (1) published before September 2023, (2) published in peer-reviewed journals, (3) participants were women athletes, (4) published in English and (5) relating to menstrual health. Articles were assessed as good, fair or poor quality using the Inclusion of Participant Ethnicity Quality Assessment Criteria. From the 1089 studies available from the initial database search, 55 studies considered ethnicity. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed as either good (22%), fair (44%) or poor (33%) in quality in their consideration of athlete ethnicity. 81% of research articles on menstrual health in sports do not consider athlete ethnicity, and when ethnicity is discussed, it rarely meets the criteria for cultural safety in the research process. Most studies did not factor ethnicity into the analysis and lacked cultural considerations in the research design and interventions. More careful inclusion of ethnicity in sports menstrual health-related research and recognition of social and cultural influences on health and research outcomes for indigenous and other ethnic minority groups is needed. Such research is required to support coaches, medical personnel and support staff in designing culturally safe environments for sportswomen from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.",['Gibbons AE; Pedlar C; Varner Hemi K; Bruinvels G; Hamilton B; Thorpe H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38408858,study aims to investigate how athlete ethnicity is discussed in research on menstrual health in sports. aims to investigate how athlete ethnicity is discussed in inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Prevalence and knowledge of heavy menstrual bleeding among gynecology outpatients by scanning a WeChat QR Code.,"The aim of this study was to assess menstrual blood loss (MBL) and knowledge of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) among the gynecology outpatients at Peking University People's Hospital, by scanning a WeChat (a social media application software developed by Tencent) QR Code using a mobile phone or tablet. This survey was conducted among outpatients who were treated at the Gynecology Department of Peking University People's Hospital between September 2016 and November 2016. All participants filled up the questionnaires and scales through WeChat: general information questionnaire, Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC), Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Quality-of-Life Scale (MMAS), and HMB knowledge questionnaire. Menstrual blood volume was assessed by the PBAC and self-assessment. Among the 1152 patients who filled out the survey, 77.4% (892/1152) had normal menstrual cycle (assessed by the patients), 15.6% (180/1152) patients described themselves as HMB, whereas the results from PBAC showed that 58.0% (668/1152) had HMB (PBAC ≥100). Among patients with PBAC ≥100, only 26.8% (179/668) patients reported HMB through self-assessment. Regarding its impact on daily life, the MMAS scores of HMB patients (PBAC ≥100) were significantly lower compared to those with normal blood loss (P<0.001). Regarding the awareness to HMB, 63.2% (728/1152) of the patients were not familiar with HMB. HMB is a common abnormal uterine bleeding and is frequently found among Chinese gynecology outpatients. HMB has major impacts on a woman's quality of life, affecting both physical and emotional health domains. Since women generally have low levels of awareness and understanding of HMB, they could assess their blood loss using the PBAC, which they can forward to their health care provider using a mobile phone or tablet and the WeChat platform. This tool may be effortlessly used by the health care providers and patients to easily share HMB-related data.",['Su S; Yang X; Su Q; Zhao Y'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240178,menstrual blood loss (MBL) and knowledge of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) were assessed by a weChat QR code. the aim of this study was to assess menstrual blood loss (MBL) and knowledge of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) among gynecology outpatients at Peking University People's Hospital.
"Menstrual Practice Needs Scale short form (MPNS-SF) and rapid (MPNS-R): development in Khulna, Bangladesh, and validation in cross-sectional surveys from Bangladesh and Uganda.","Develop and validate short and rapid forms of the 36-item Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36). Item reduction prioritised content validity and was informed by cognitive interviews with schoolgirls in Bangladesh, performance of scale items in past research and stakeholder feedback. The original MPNS-36 was revalidated, and short and rapid forms tested in a cross-sectional survey. This was followed by further tests of dimensionality, internal consistency and validity in multiple cross-sectional surveys. Short form (MPNS-SF) and rapid form (MPNS-R) measures were developed in a survey of 313 menstruating girls (mean age=13.51) in Khulna, Bangladesh. They were further tested in the baseline survey of the Adolescent Menstrual Experiences and Health Cohort, in Khulna, Bangladesh (891 menstruating girls, mean age=12.40); and the dataset from the MPNS-36 development in Soroti, Uganda (538 menstruating girls, mean age=14.49). The 18-item short form reflects the six original subscales, with the four core subscales demonstrating good fit in all three samples (Khulna pilot: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.064, 90% CI 0.043 to 0.084, Comparative Fit Index (CFI)=0.94, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)=0.92. Cohort baseline: RMSEA=0.050, 90% CI 0.039 to 0.062, CFI=0.96, TLI=0.95. Uganda: RMSEA=0.039, 90% CI 0.028 to 0.050, CFI=0.95, TLI=0.94). The 9-item rapid form captures diverse needs. A two-factor structure was the most appropriate but fell short of adequate fit (Khulna pilot: RMSEA=0.092, 90% CI 0.000 to 0.158, CFI=0.93, TLI=0.89). Hypothesised associations between the MPNS scores and other constructs were comparable between the MPNS-36 and MPNS-SF in all populations, and replicated, with attenuation, in the MPNS-R. Internal consistency remained acceptable. The MPNS-SF offers a reliable and valid measure of adolescent girls' menstrual hygiene experience while reducing participant burden, to support implementation and improve measurement in menstrual health research. The MPNS-R provides a brief measure with poorer structural validity, suited to short surveys and including menstrual health within broader research topics.",['Hennegan J; Hasan MT; Jalil T; Hunter EC; Head A; Jabbar A; Mohosin AB; Zoha NS; Alam MK; Dunstan L; Akter S; Zaman A; Kaiser A; Smith C; Bagala L; Azzopardi PS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960457,"short form (MPNS-SF) and rapid form (MPNS-R) measures were developed in a survey of 313 menstruating girls (mean age=13.51) in Khulna, Bangladesh. the 18-item short form reflects the six original subscales."
Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Network: Summary of Findings and Network Outcomes.,"The Go Red for Women movement was initiated by the American Heart Association (AHA) in the early 2000s to raise awareness concerning cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women. In 2016, the AHA funded 5 research centers across the United States to advance our knowledge of the risks and presentation of CVD that are specific to women. This report highlights the findings of the centers, showing how insufficient sleep, sedentariness, and pregnancy-related complications may increase CVD risk in women, as well as presentation and factors associated with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in women. These projects were augmented by collaborative ancillary studies assessing the relationships between various lifestyle behaviors, including nightly fasting duration, mindfulness, and behavioral and anthropometric risk factors and CVD risk, as well as metabolomic profiling of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in women.

"Antibiotics improve reproductive outcomes after frozen-thaw embryo transfer for chronic endometritis treatment, especially in those with repeated implantation failure.","To investigate the impact of antibiotic treatment for chronic endometritis (CE) on the pregnancy outcome of frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles and the relevant clinical risk factors associated with CE. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 1352 patients who underwent hysteroscopy and diagnostic curettage at Nanjing Maternal and Child Health Hospital from July 2020 to December 2021. All patients underwent CD138 immunohistochemical (IHC) testing to diagnose CE, and a subset of them underwent FET after hysteroscopy. Patient histories were collected, and reproductive prognosis was followed up. Out of 1088 patients, 443 (40.7%) were diagnosed with CE. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses revealed that parity ≥ 2, a history of ectopic pregnancy, moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea, hydrosalpinx, endometrial polyps, a history of ≥ 2 uterine operations, and RIF were significantly associated with an elevated risk of CE (P < 0.05). Analysis of the effect of CE on pregnancy outcomes in FET cycles after antibiotic treatment indicated that treated CE patients exhibited a significantly lower miscarriage rate (8.7%) and early miscarriage rate (2.9%) than untreated non-CE patients (20.2%, 16.8%). Moreover, the singleton live birth rate (45.5%) was significantly higher in treated CE patients than in untreated non-CE patients (32.7%). Survival analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the first clinical pregnancy time between treated CE and untreated non-CE patients after hysteroscopy (P = 0.0019). Stratified analysis based on the presence of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) demonstrated that in the RIF group, treated CE patients were more likely to achieve clinical pregnancy than untreated non-CE patients (P = 0.0021). Among hysteroscopy-positive patients, no significant difference was noted in pregnancy outcomes between the treatment and control groups (P > 0.05). Infertile patients with a history of parity ≥ 2, hydrosalpinx, a history of ectopic pregnancy, moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea, endometrial polyps, a history of ≥ 2 uterine operations, and RIF are at an increased risk of CE; these patients should be recommended to undergo hysteroscopy combined with CD138 examination before embryo transfer.

Period Poverty: Surveying the Prevalence in Toledo-Area Schools.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> The lack of access to period products, which has been colloquially termed ""period poverty,"" is a problem that millions of people face worldwide. Investigators have found that period poverty is a pervasive issue in the United States, despite its status as a high resource country. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of period poverty in school-aged adolescents in Toledo, Ohio. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study used an observational cross-sectional design and was approved by the institutional review board. Participants completed a survey that assessed their access to period products, their level of understanding about their sexual/menstrual health, their feelings toward menstruation, and the perceived impact of periods on their lives. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Younger students were more likely to miss school due to lack of period products (<i>p</i> = 0.0084). To the question ""Why don't you have pads or tampons?"" 36.2% expressed financial concerns and 18.3% reported inadequate transportation. When asked whether students ever had to miss school due to their cycle, 9.4% identified a lack of products as their reason. Participants also reported high rates of absence from sports, work, spending time with family/friends, and theater/music practice due to their menstrual period. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> As people across the globe experience period poverty, our study demonstrates evidence of this phenomenon among Toledo adolescents. Owing to the lack of access to menstrual hygiene products, students report repurposing miscellaneous items in place of pads or tampons, missing school or work, and associating negative connotations with their cycles.",['Feeley M; Afon O; Gonzalez T; Gorrell C; Warner E; Matus C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38350148,"study was a study of the prevalence of period poverty in school-aged adolescents. study assessed access to period products, level of understanding about sexual/menstrual health. study was approved by the institutional review board."
Inconsistencies in the perceived impact of the menstrual cycle on sport performance and in the prevalence of menstrual cycle symptoms: A scoping review of the literature.,"This scoping review aimed to summarize the findings of studies regarding the perceived impact of the menstrual cycle on athletic performance, as well as the prevalence of negative menstrual cycle symptoms. Scoping review. Three databases were searched and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used as guidance. A total of 39 studies were included in the final analysis. Between 2.8 and 100 % of athletes reported their performance being negatively impacted by their menstrual cycle, and the main reason was the occurrence of menstrual cycle symptoms. Additionally, a large variability in the prevalence of menstrual cycle symptoms was reported in the different studies mainly due to methodological differences and recall biases. Similarly, as to what has been reported in reviews summarizing performance outcomes during different menstrual cycle phases, this review highlights the high degree of variability between how athletes perceive to be impacted by their menstrual/hormonal contraceptive cycle.

Period Poverty from a Public Health and Legislative Perspective.,"Period poverty is a global issue that needs to be addressed as a public health crisis. It is directly related to Sustainable Health Goals three, four, five, six, and eight. Period poverty adversely affects the health of anyone capable of menstruating, which is nearly half of the world population, at the physiological, emotional, and psychosocial level. Biases, cultural beliefs, ethical reproductive justice issues, social stigma, and systemic factors contribute to period poverty. Every month, certain menstruators are disproportionately impacted by period poverty and struggle to access basic hygienic necessities. Important stakeholders include not only the individual who experiences menses but also educators and school systems, healthcare professionals, policymakers, public health officials, and researchers. Everyone has a role in addressing period poverty by voting for officials that proactively support legislation, policy, and programs at all levels to effectively advocate for menstrual equity and address barriers contributing to period poverty. This includes policies that increase access to menstrual hygiene products, safe menstrual management methods, and reproductive and women's health education. Programs globally that focus on capacity building and sustainability strategies can be used as models to reduce period poverty, thereby fostering a sense of empowerment and menstruators' sense of autonomy, dignity, and equality.",['Mann S; Byrne SK'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38063548,"period poverty affects the health of anyone capable of menstruating. it affects menstruators at the physiological, emotional, and psychosocial level. biases, cultural beliefs, ethical reproductive justice issues contribute to period poverty."
IMPACT OF MOTHER'S HYPOTHYROIDISM ON FETAL DEVELOPMENT AND OUTCOMES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.,"The thyroid, a gland with a butterfly-like shape in the base of the human neck, plays an important role in metabolism. Body heat, energy levels, weight, hair, fingernail, and regular menstruation cycles are controlled by three hormones produced by the thyroid. A system of feedback regulates the release of those hormones. Overproduction as well as underproduction of thyroid hormones can result from shifts in the stimulation and regulation of those hormones. These factors can have physiological or pathological origins. Pregnancy is a physiological factor. There is a plethora of physiological and psychological shifts that occur during pregnancy. A thyroid alteration in the mother is one example. Thyroid irregularities result from a failure to adjust to new circumstances. Thyroid hormone levels can drop, or manufacturing could be slowed during pregnancy due to variations in hormone concentration. Hypothyroidism describes this disorder. Hypothyroidism in women who are pregnant is either gestational or could be a disorder that is present before pregnancy. Gestational hypothyroidism cures itself throughout postpartum times, though it can stay as subclinical hyperthyroidism for some time after delivery. They pose a serious risk to development, stunt the growth of the unborn child and lead to defects in subsequent generations. Enhanced thyroid binding globulin levels, enhanced iodine clearance by the kidneys, modified effects of the human reproductive hormone and reduced dietary consumption of iodine lead to these alterations in the gland. Cretinism and mental disorders are among the serious health problems related to an iodine imbalance in maternal hypothyroidism. The growth of the brain, nervous system and Intelligence of an unborn child depends on thyroid hormones. As a result, normal early stages of development suffer due to changes in maternal hormone levels.",['Singh A; Sathe N; Rani K; Das S; Patel J D; Jyothi R R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38325294,"thyroid plays an important role in metabolism. body heat, energy levels, weight, hair, fingernail and regular menstruation cycles are controlled by three hormones produced by the thyroid. overproduction as well as underproduction of thyroid hormones can result from shifts in the stimulation and regulation of those hormones."
Optimization of micelle-encapsulated extremely small sized iron oxide nanoparticles as a T1 contrast imaging agent: biodistribution and safety profile.,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for various clinical applications, such as tumor-targeted imaging, hyperthermia therapy, drug delivery, and live-cell tracking. However, the application of IONPs as T1 contrast agents has been restricted due to their high r2 values and r2/r1 ratios, which limit their effectiveness in T1 contrast enhancement. Notably, IONPs with diameters smaller than 5 nm, referred to as extremely small-sized IONPs (ESIONs), have demonstrated potential in overcoming these limitations. To advance the clinical application of ESIONs as T1 contrast agents, we have refined a scale-up process for micelle encapsulation aimed at improving the hydrophilization of ESIONs, and have carried out comprehensive in vivo biodistribution and preclinical toxicity assessments. The optimization of the scale-up micelle-encapsulation process, specifically employing Tween60 at a concentration of 10% v/v, resulted in ESIONs that were uniformly hydrophilized, with an average size of 9.35 nm and a high purification yield. Stability tests showed that these ESIONs maintained consistent size over extended storage periods and dispersed effectively in blood and serum-mimicking environments. Relaxivity measurements indicated an r1 value of 3.43 mM<sup>- 1</sup>s<sup>- 1</sup> and a favorable r2/r1 ratio of 5.36, suggesting their potential as T1 contrast agents. Biodistribution studies revealed that the ESIONs had extended circulation times in the bloodstream and were primarily cleared via the hepatobiliary route, with negligible renal excretion. We monitored blood clearance and organ distribution using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, MRI signal variations in a dose-dependent manner highlighted different behaviors at varying ESIONs concentrations, implying that optimal dosages might be specific to the intended imaging application. Preclinical safety evaluations indicated that ESIONs were tolerable in rats at doses up to 25 mg/kg. This study effectively optimized a scale-up process for the micelle encapsulation of ESIONs, leading to the production of hydrophilic ESIONs at gram-scale levels. These optimized ESIONs showcased properties conducive to T1 contrast imaging, such as elevated r1 relaxivity and a reduced r2/r1 ratio. Biodistribution study underscored their prolonged bloodstream presence and efficient clearance through the liver and bile, without significant renal involvement. The preclinical toxicity tests affirmed the safety of the ESIONs, supporting their potential use as T1 contrast agent with versatile clinical application.",['Suh M; Park JY; Ko GB; Kim JY; Hwang DW; Rees L; Conway GE; Doak SH; Kang H; Lee N; Hyeon T; Lee YS; Lee DS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39014410,IONPs have been cleared by the fda for various clinical applications. the application of IONPs as T1 contrast agents has been restricted due to their high r2 values and r2/r1 ratios.

Changes in the menstrual hygiene management facilities and usage among Bangladeshi school girls and its effect on school absenteeism from 2014 to 2018.,"The lack of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) information and facilities in schools is a major contributor to adolescent girls' school absenteeism in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh. This paper examines the changes over time in school MHM facilities, knowledge and perceptions among adolescent girls, in relation to school absenteeism between 2014 and 2018 in Bangladesh. We examined changes in MHM and school absenteeism among schoolgirls using nationally representative data from the Bangladesh National Hygiene Baseline Survey 2014 and National Hygiene Survey 2018. Given the repetitive nature of our data and its clustering within participants, our method included performing descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) modelling to analyse these changes. Results showed that adolescent girls' menstruation-related absenteeism decreased between 2014 and 2018. Percentage of adolescents who missed school decreased from 25% to 14% (PD: -11; CI: -16 to -6.1), while the average number of missed days reduced from 2.8 to 2.5 (PD: -0.33; CI: -0.57 to -0.10). In the GEE model, we found that living in rural areas (coef: -5.6; CI: -10.06 to -1.14), parental restrictions on going outside (coef: 4.47; CI: 0.75 to 8.2), education levels of girls (coef: -9.48; CI: -14.17 to -4.79), girl's belief that menstruation affects school performance (coef: 23.32; CI: 19.71 to 26.93), and using old cloths (coef: -4.2; CI: -7.6 to -0.79) were significantly associated with higher absenteeism. However, participant's age, type of school, knowledge of menstruation before menarche, receiving information regarding MHM, separate place for changing absorbents, and separate latrine and urine facility were not significantly associated with the changes in absenteeism over time. This paper emphasised the associations between changes in school absenteeism, parental restrictions on students, students' education levels, and menstruation-related misperceptions. Ongoing research, policy reviews, and targeted interventions to improve MHM perceptions among girls are required to provide long-term benefits for adolescent girls in Bangladesh.",['Jahan F; Shuchi NS; Shoab AK; Alam MU; Bashar SMK; Islam K; Jahan H; Hasan M; Alam MM; Rahman M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38230656,"changes in school MHM facilities, knowledge and perceptions among schoolgirls. the change was based on national data from the Bangladesh national Hygiene Baseline Survey 2014 and national Hygiene Survey 2018."
Is endometriosis due to evolutionary maladaptation?,"Similar to diabetes and unlike many pathogen-induced diseases, endometriosis is likely a result of maladaptation to the evolutionary heritage of humans. The objective of this article is to review the literature and improve understanding of the evolutionary factors behind endometriosis, leading to more effective prevention and treatment approaches. In primates, spontaneous decidualization of the endometrium evolved to ensure optimal implantation of a limited number of early embryos, unlike many non-primates which depend on early embryos to induce decidualization and subsequent pregnancy. Spontaneous decidualization results in menstrual bleeding when embryo implantation does not occur, and endometriosis is commonly believed to be caused by retrograde menstruation. Although direct evidence is lacking, it is likely that hunter-gatherer women experienced fewer menstrual periods due to pregnancy shortly after menarche, followed by repeated pregnancies and lactation. However, the mismatch between the evolved uterine physiology and rapid societal changes has led to modern women delaying pregnancy and experiencing numerous menstrual periods, potentially increasing the incidence of endometriosis. The symptoms of endometriosis are often managed by suppressing menstruation through systemic hormonal treatments, but these may have side effects. For patients with a family history of endometriosis or in the early stages of the disease, intrauterine devices releasing progesterone locally could prevent uterine bleeding and the development of endometriosis while preserving fertility and minimizing side effects.",['Mumusoglu S; Hsueh AJW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38177037,endometriosis is likely a result of evolutionary maladaptation. the disease is common in hunter-gatherer women.
The impact of ovarian stimulation on the human endometrial microenvironment.,"How does ovarian stimulation (OS), which is used to mature multiple oocytes for ART procedures, impact the principal cellular compartments and transcriptome of the human endometrium in the periovulatory and mid-secretory phases? During the mid-secretory window of implantation, OS alters the abundance of endometrial immune cells, whereas during the periovulatory period, OS substantially changes the endometrial transcriptome and impacts both endometrial glandular and immune cells. Pregnancies conceived in an OS cycle are at risk of complications reflective of abnormal placentation and placental function. OS can alter endometrial gene expression and immune cell populations. How OS impacts the glandular, stromal, immune, and vascular compartments of the endometrium, in the periovulatory period as compared to the window of implantation, is unknown. This prospective cohort study carried out between 2020 and 2022 included 25 subjects undergoing OS and 25 subjects in natural menstrual cycles. Endometrial biopsies were performed in the proliferative, periovulatory, and mid-secretory phases. Blood samples were processed to determine serum estradiol and progesterone levels. Both the endometrial transcriptome and the principal cellular compartments of the endometrium, including glands, stroma, immune, and vasculature, were evaluated by examining endometrial dating, differential gene expression, protein expression, cell populations, and the three-dimensional structure in endometrial tissue. Mann-Whitney U tests, unpaired t-tests or one-way ANOVA and pairwise multiple comparison tests were used to statistically evaluate differences. In the periovulatory period, OS induced high levels of differential gene expression, glandular-stromal dyssynchrony, and an increase in both glandular epithelial volume and the frequency of endometrial monocytes/macrophages. In the window of implantation during the mid-secretory phase, OS induced changes in endometrial immune cells, with a greater frequency of B cells and a lower frequency of CD4 effector T cells. The data underlying this article have been uploaded to the Genome Expression Omnibus/National Center for Biotechnology Information with accession number GSE220044. A limited number of subjects were included in this study, although the subjects within each group, natural cycle or OS, were homogenous in their clinical characteristics. The number of subjects utilized was sufficient to identify significant differences; however, with a larger number of subjects and additional power, we may detect additional differences. Another limitation of the study is that proliferative phase biopsies were collected in natural cycles, but not in OS cycles. Given that the OS cycle subjects did not have known endometrial factor infertility, and the comparisons involved subjects who had a similar and robust response to stimulation, the findings are generalizable to women with a normal response to OS. OS substantially altered the periovulatory phase endometrium, with fewer transcriptomic and cell type-specific changes in the mid-secretory phase. Our findings show that after OS, the endometrial microenvironment in the window of implantation possesses many more similarities to that of a natural cycle than does the periovulatory endometrium. Further investigation of the immune compartment and the functional significance of this cellular compartment under OS conditions is warranted.

Factors affecting the prevention of unwanted pregnancies among young adolescents in secondary schools in the Eastern Province of Rwanda: An explorative qualitative study.,"The escalating number of teenage pregnancies, especially in the Eastern province of Rwanda, continues to raise concerns regarding the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in the country. Recent statistics indicate that 5% of adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have given birth and 4% are currently pregnant with their first child. This highlights the critical need for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education tailored for adolescents. However, there is limited evidence on factors affecting adolescents' efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections in the Eastern Province of Rwanda, and the support systems available to adolescents in secondary schools, including the role of parents in promoting their sexual and reproductive health to minimize the risky sexual practices. An explorative qualitative study utilizing focus group discussions was conducted to garner the perspectives of 118 adolescents enrolled in six twelve-year-basic-education schools from three districts of the Eastern Province of Rwanda. Thematic analysis was employed to identify themes related to the impact of various factors on adolescents' sexual and reproductive health as they navigate through the physical and emotional changes from puberty to adolescence. Adolescents are aware of the potential consequences of engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse which include the risk of unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and emotional distress. Female participants emphasized that young girls who do not receive adequate support upon becoming pregnant prematurely may encounter depression, discontinue their education, face the harsh reality of extreme poverty, and struggle significantly in assuming the responsibilities of parenthood as young single mothers. Adolescents highlighted the lack of parental guidance concerning sexual and reproductive matters as a significant obstacle in their pursuit of a healthy and safe sexual and reproductive health during adolescence. Inadequate parental engagement still hinders adolescents in navigating the physical bodily, mental, and emotional changes during adolescence. This affects their capacity to make well-informed decisions to prevent adverse consequences such as unintended pregnancies, substance misuse, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDS resulting from unsafe sexual practices. Since this study was qualitative, quantitative data necessary for a precise evaluation of the extent of the problem related to the absence of parental involvement in educating adolescents on sexual and reproductive health needs further research.",['Uhawenimana TC; Muganwa K; Uwimana MC; Musabwasoni MGS; Tengera O; Bahumura J; Mukashyaka J; Mukakamanzi J; Habyarimana E; Ngerageze I; Chinwe HN; Uwingabire E; Mujawamariya F; Nsengiyumva R; Bazirete O'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058739,5% of adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have given birth. 4% are currently pregnant with their first child. there is limited evidence on factors affecting adolescents' efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Male support for cervical cancer screening in Debre Berhan City Ethiopia a community based cross sectional survey.,"Male partner involvement strongly influences a woman's decision to undergo cervical cancer screening. Women of low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. Women living in low-and middle-income countries often encounter resistance from their partners regarding participation in cervical cancer screening. The lack of men's support for sexual and reproductive health programs, including cervical cancer screening, creates a barrier to women's utilization of health services. To assess Ethiopian men's awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes toward cervical cancer screening and their support to their female partners during screening. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from June 20, 2023, to August 04, 2023. A multistage sampling procedure was used to recruit 614 male survey participants. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sociodemographic data. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to measure the associations between the dependent and independent variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In this survey, 58.5% (359) of participants supported their partners for cervical cancer screening. More than half 55.9% (343) of the participants had an awareness of cervical cancer disease and 47.2% (290) participants knew the risk factors associated with the development of cervical cancer. In addition to that, 66.8% (410) of men have a positive attitude towards screening and encourage their wives to get screened if they notice symptoms of cervical cancer. Regarding the perceptions of cervical cancer, 37.0% (227) of male participants believed that their female partners were at risk of developing the disease, while 38.3% (235) of men believed that cervical cancer screening was only necessary if the woman showed symptoms. Completion of higher education (AOR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.60-8.79, p = 0.002), living with other people (AOR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.29, p < 0.0001), not being tested for HIV (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.74, p = 0.011), and having information about cervical cancer (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.36-8.15, p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with men's support for their partners in cervical cancer screening. Men's awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of cervical cancer screening were low. On the other hand, men have a positive attitude towards screening and encourage their wives to get screened if they notice symptoms of cervical cancer. This survey will serve as a basis for the development of further strategies and action plans to promote and support male participation in cervical cancer screening in Ethiopia. This can be achieved through the development of strategic plans, including public campaigns, raising awareness among social and community leaders, involving non-governmental organizations focusing on women's health, and community education.",['Beyene DA; Ayele SG; Wubneh HD; Tsige AW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112655,women of low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. lack of men's support for sexual and reproductive health programs creates a barrier to women's utilization of health services.
Effect of Exercises on Central and Endocrine System for Pain Modulation in Primary Dysmenorrhea.,"Dysmenorrhea is the term for describing complex menstrual flow and painful spasmodic cramps during menstruation, and pain without any pathology is considered Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD). It is the most frequent ailment among women of all ages and races. The pain is dull and throbbing in character and occurs in the lower back and abdomen. Symptoms commonly appear 6 to 12 months after menarche, with the most significant incidence in the late teen and early twenties. Physical exercise is nearly a new non-medical intervention to relieve PD associated pain. Aerobics, stretching and Resistive exercises for 8-12 weeks, either supervised or unsupervised, relieves pain. Exercises are believed to cause hormonal changes in the uterine lining, which reduces PD symptoms. Researchers have presumed different pain-relieving methods, ranging from non-opioids to opioids to hormonal for variations in pain sensitivity. Exercise-induced analgesia provides the central pathway as the primary mechanism for pain reduction while, another way to reducing pain in PD may be a hormonal interaction. The hormonal changes causing exercise-induced pain modulation during the menstruation cycle is not clearly understood and the interaction and activation of all the central and endocrine components, which is a complex mechanism, is also not explained clearly. This study briefly reviews the physiological mechanism of Exercise-induced analgesia and its potent roles in controlling the pathogenesis of PD for pain relief.",['Jaleel G; Shaphe MA; Khan AR; Malhotra D; Khan H; Parveen S; Qasheesh M; Beg RA; Chahal A; Ahmad F; Ahmad MF'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35300040,exercise is nearly a new non-medical intervention to relieve PD associated pain. exercise-induced analgesia provides the central pathway as the primary mechanism for pain reduction. hormonal interaction is not clearly understood.
Psychosocial Problems of Adolescent Girls during Menstruation.,"To study the psychosocial problems of adolescent girls during menstruation. Cross-sectional study was conducted in Chennai. Descriptive research design was used. Sample size: Sixty students were selected randomly by the teacher from Bhoodhur Govt high school, Sholavaram, Chennai and referred to researcher for the study purpose. Inclusion criteria: Adolescent girls who were aged 13-16 years and attained menarche. Majority (71.7%) of adolescent girls belong to the age group of 14 - 15 years, 68% were in ninth standard. Nearly half of the respondents were using pads (45%) and clothes (42%) as absorbent, majority (65%) preferred to discuss about their menstrual problems with mother, 28% with friends about menarche, 7% do not discuss with anyone. Most of them (58%) as faced physical problems during menstruation such as pre-menstrual syndrome (55%), menorrhagia (12%), sleep disturbance (12%), body pain (68%), head ache (45%), leg pain (55%).Majority (67%) had psychological problems such as change in the mood (70%) irritability, (78%) restlessness, (63%) unstable mood, (58%) feeling stressed). One-third had faced psychosocial problems in terms of unaware of menarche before the onset (65%), 10% do not have privacy to change sanitary pad and do not know how to use pad, 32% faced restrictions during menarche.

Drug-drug interaction between NSAIDS and low-dose aspirin: a focus on cardiovascular and GI toxicity.,"The aging of the population in the US and other countries means that a large number of people will likely take NSAIDs for the relief of pain and low-dose aspirin (LD-ASA) for cardioprotection. However, the cardioprotective value of LD-ASA can be compromised in patients who take NSAIDs concomitantly, because some NSAIDs competitively bind to critical amino-acid residues on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and interfere with the mechanism of antiplatelet activity of LD-ASA. A review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of current issues surrounding the concomitant use of NSAIDs and LD-ASA, to explore potential mechanisms for this drug-drug interaction and to consider current and future treatment options that may mitigate the risk associated with their concomitant use. NSAIDs offer effective pain relief for the most common forms of pain, such as low back pain, musculoskeletal pain associated with arthritis, postsurgical pain, headache, acute pain syndromes, menstrual pain and dental pain. The development of NSAID formulations that offer effective pain control with fewer or less serious adverse effects due to interference with ASA would be a valuable medical advance. Several promising treatment options and regimens may be available in the future.",['Nalamachu S; Pergolizzi JV; Raffa RB; Lakkireddy DR; Taylor R'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24905189,a large number of people will likely take NSAIDs for the relief of pain and low-dose aspirin (LD-ASA) for cardioprotection. some NSAIDs competitively bind to critical amino-acid residues on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. some NSAIDs interfere with the mechanism of antiplatelet activity of LD-ASA.

How does a Social and Behavioral Change Communication Intervention Predict Menstrual Health and Hygiene Management: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Interventions in India to improve menstrual health and hygiene management (MHHM) have been implemented at the national, state, district and school level. However, evaluations of these interventions have been scarce. The objective of the study was to determine if a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention (GARIMA) had a relationship with knowledge, attitudes, interpersonal communication, restrictions and MHHM using a comparison group post-test only design among 2206 adolescent girls. Intervention villages and adolescent girls were selected through stratified random sampling based on where GARIMA was implemented. Villages and adolescent girls in comparison villages were matched socio-demographically to intervention villages and adolescent girls. Multi-level logistic regressions assessed the relationship between the encoded exposure, mediators and MHHM. The results showed that the encoded exposure predicted all behaviors corresponding to MHHM. Additionally, adolescent girls in the high encoded exposure group had significantly higher knowledge about puberty and reproductive parts (AOR: 2.03 (95% CI: 1.31 - 3.15)), positive attitudes towards gender (AOR: 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.16)) and higher levels of some discussion and dialogue (AOR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04 - 1.92)). Future programs should use SBCC to improve MHHM behavior but involve families, peers and community members to a greater extent in order to improve attitudes towards menstruation, attitudes towards restrictions, attitudes towards absorbent use and reduce restrictions within the community.",['Ramaiya A; Malhotra A; Cronin C; Stevens S; Kostizak K; Sharma A; Nagar S; Sood S'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31375074,intervention villages and adolescent girls were matched socio-demographically to intervention villages and adolescent girls. the results showed that the encoded exposure predicted all behaviors corresponding to MHHM.
Cloud Computing to Enable Wearable-Driven Longitudinal Hemodynamic Maps.,"Tracking hemodynamic responses to treatment and stimuli over long periods remains a grand challenge. Moving from established single-heartbeat technology to longitudinal profiles would require continuous data describing how the patient's state evolves, new methods to extend the temporal domain over which flow is sampled, and high-throughput computing resources. While personalized digital twins can accurately measure 3D hemodynamics over several heartbeats, state-of-the-art methods would require hundreds of years of wallclock time on leadership scale systems to simulate one day of activity. To address these challenges, we propose a cloud-based, parallel-in-time framework leveraging continuous data from wearable devices to capture the first 3D patient-specific, longitudinal hemodynamic maps. We demonstrate the validity of our method by establishing ground truth data for 750 beats and comparing the results. Our cloud-based framework is based on an initial fixed set of simulations to enable the wearable-informed creation of personalized longitudinal hemodynamic maps.",['Tanade C; Rakestraw E; Ladd W; Draeger E; Randles A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38939612,cloud computing to enable wearable-driven longitudinal hemodynamic maps. 750 beats are mapped using a single-heartbeat technology. 750 beats are mapped using a single-heartbeat technology.
Psychiatric symptoms and disorders associated with reproductive cyclicity in women: advances in screening tools.,"Female-specific psychiatric illness including premenstrual dysphoria, perinatal depression, and psychopathology related to the perimenopausal period are often underdiagnosed and treated. These conditions can negatively affect the quality of life for women and their families. The development of screening tools has helped guide our understanding of these conditions. There is a wide disparity in the methods, definitions, and tools used in studies relevant to female-specific psychiatric illness. As a result, there is no consensus on one tool that is most appropriate for use in a research or clinical setting. In reviewing this topic, we hope to highlight the evolution of various tools as they have built on preexisting instruments and to identify the psychometric properties and clinical applicability of available tools. It would be valuable for researchers to reach a consensus on a core set of screening instruments specific to female psychopathology to gain consistency within and between clinical settings.",['Hall E; Steiner M'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26102476,"advances in screening tools have helped guide our understanding of these conditions. there is a wide disparity in the methods, definitions, and tools used in studies relevant to female-specific psychiatric illness."
Quantitative Analysis of Right Atrial Functions by 2D-Speckle Tracking Echocardiography During Healthy Pregnancy.,"The role of speckle tracking in the assessment of right atrial (RA) deformation parameters has not been investigated yet. The purpose of this article is to establish the effects of normal pregnancy on RA mechanical changes obtained by 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. A total of 49 healthy pregnant women were included in the study. All participants were followed for each trimester and postpartum period, encompassing standard assessments of both RA and ventricular functions, as well as measurements of RA global peak atrial longitudinal strain (RA-Global-PALS) and RA global peak atrial contraction strain (RA-Global-PACS). Additionally, the RA segments were individually evaluated with respect to strain parameters. During pregnancy, the increased volume load resulted in elevated RA reservoir function, as indicated by RA-Global-PALS, and increased contraction parameter, as indicated by RA-Global-PACS. These changes were within physiological limits and reversible. Segmental analysis of the right atrium showed similar findings for regional PACS and PALS parameters. In this study, we established normal RA deformation parameters for healthy pregnancies. These data will aid in discerning various measures of RA phasic function in cardiovascular and systemic conditions among normal pregnant women. Moreover, they may offer insights into potential cardiac pathologies that may arise during the pregnancy.",['Guler Y; Karagoz A; Inan D; Sonsoz MR; Bilen MN; Guler A; Kirma C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39078062,a total of 49 healthy pregnant women were included in the study. the role of speckle tracking in the assessment of right atrial deformation parameters has not been investigated yet.
The role of social media in public health awareness during times of war in Sudan: snakebites and scorpion stings.,"Snakebite envenomation (SBE) and scorpion sting envenomation (SSE) are significant neglected tropical diseases that primarily affect impoverished communities in rural areas of developing nations. A lack of understanding about snake and scorpion species and their distribution exacerbates the disabilities and fatalities caused by SBE and SSE. In Sudan, particularly in regions affected by ongoing conflicts where healthcare resources are scarce, social media platforms offer a cost-effective approach to addressing public health challenges. Our aim in this study is to highlight the benefits of using social media for data collection and health promotion in such environments. We present a cost-effective communication and data collection strategy implemented at the Toxic Organisms Research Centre (TORC) of the University of Khartoum, focusing on a Facebook group, ""Scorpions and Snakes of Sudan"", as our primary social media platform. Additionally, we discuss the lessons learned and the initial impact of this strategy on enhancing population health literacy. The group community is composed of ~ 5000 members from 14 countries. During the period from January 2023 to January 2024, we received 417 enquiries about snakes and scorpions belonging to 11 families and composed of 55 species. In addition, 53 other enquiries covered a range of organisms and their tracks (e.g., spiders, skinks, chameleons, foxes, sun spiders, centipedes, lizards, moth larvae, and insect tracks). The first photographic evidence of Malpolon monspessulanus in Sudan was via the group activities. The rare species Telescopus gezirae, the Blue Nile cat snake, is also documented via the group member's queries. Recognizing the evolving nature of social media use in public health, we also address the current limitations and evidence gaps that need to be addressed to effectively translate best practices into policy. In conclusion, utilizing Facebook as an institutional platform to share scientific information in simple Arabic language underscores the proactive roles that citizens, scientists, and public health stakeholders can play in leveraging social media for eHealth, eAwareness, and public health initiatives. This approach highlights the potential for collaborative efforts, particularly during crises, to maximize the benefits of social media in advancing public health.",['Baleela RMH; Mohammad A; Saeed SAK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38956503,"social media is a cost-effective approach to addressing public health challenges. the study focuses on a Facebook group, ""Scorpions and Snakes of Sudan"" the group is composed of  5000 members from 14 countries."
Correlation of sex hormone levels with orthodontic tooth movement in the maxilla: a prospective cohort study.,"Sex hormones secreted during the menstrual cycle and the application of orthodontic forces to teeth can affect the metabolism of periodontal ligaments. This study aimed to determine whether there are any differences in orthodontic tooth displacement during the menstrual cycle and when using hormonal contraceptives and whether the amount of female sex hormones influences the efficiency of tooth displacement. A total of 120 women aged between 20 and 30 years with Angle Class II requiring transpalatal arch (TPA) to derotate teeth 16 and 26 were included in this study. The participants were divided into two groups: group A, which included women with regular menstruation, and control group B, which included women taking monophasic combined oral contraceptives. Group A was divided into subgroups according to the moment of TPA activation: menstruation (A1), ovulation phase (A2), and luteal phase (A3) (examination I). On intraoral scans, measurement points were marked on the proximal mesial cusps of teeth 16 and 26, and the intermolar distance (M1) was determined. The change in the position of the measurement points 6 weeks after activation (examination II) made it possible to determine the derotating extent of teeth 16 (O16) and 26 (O26) and the widening of the intermolar distance (M2-M1). In examinations I and II, tooth mobility in the alveoli was assessed using Periotest based on the periotest values (PTV) PTV1 and PTV2, respectively. A significant difference in all parameters was observed among groups A1, A2, and A3 (P < 0.001). Group A3 showed the highest values of parameters O16, O26, and M2-M1, and group A2 showed the lowest values, which did not differ from the control group (P = 0.64). PTV2 and PTV1 were the highest in group A3 and the lowest in groups A1 and B. Intergroup differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). With the quantification of changes in tooth mobility in the alveoli during the menstrual cycle in women undergoing orthodontic treatment, it was possible to determine that female sex hormones affect the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment, and the optimal moment for TPA activation is the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.",['Peruga M; Lis J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38764143,a prospective cohort study aimed to determine whether there are any differences in orthodontic tooth displacement during the menstrual cycle. a total of 120 women aged between 20 and 30 years with Angle Class II requiring transpalatal arch (TPA) to derotate teeth 16 and 26 were included in this study.
Non-invasive VOCs detection to monitor the gut microbiota metabolism in-vitro.,"This work implemented a non-invasive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitoring approach to study how food components are metabolised by the gut microbiota in-vitro. The fermentability of a model food matrix rich in dietary fibre (oat bran), and a pure prebiotic (inulin), added to a minimal gut medium was compared by looking at global changes in the volatilome. The substrates were incubated with a stabilised human faecal inoculum over a 24-h period, and VOCs were monitored without interfering with biological processes. The fermentation was performed in nitrogen-filled vials, with controlled temperature, and tracked by automated headspace-solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular patterns over time, we applied a multivariate longitudinal statistical framework: repeated measurements-ANOVA simultaneous component analysis. The methodology was able to discriminate the studied groups by looking at VOCs temporal profiles. The volatilome showed a time-dependency that was more distinct after 12 h. Short to medium-chain fatty acids showed increased peak intensities, mainly for oat bran and for inulin, but with different kinetics. At the same time, alcohols, aldehydes, and esters showed distinct trends with discriminatory power. The proposed approach can be applied to study the intertwined pathways of gut microbiota food components interaction in-vitro.","[""Dell'Olio A; Rubert J; Capozzi V; Tonezzer M; Betta E; Fogliano V; Biasioli F""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38982163,non-invasive VOCs detection to monitor gut microbiota metabolism in-vitro. the study was carried out using a non-invasive approach. the method was able to discriminate the studied groups by looking at VOCs temporal profiles.
Progesterone Levels in Adolescent Female Athletes May Contribute to Decreased Cognitive Performance During Acute Phase of Sports-Related Concussion.,"Although many outcome studies pertaining to sports-related concussion exist, female athletes with concussion remain an understudied group. We examined whether neurocognitive performance in adolescent females with sports-related concussion (SRC) is related to menstrual cycle-related hormone levels measured at one-week post-concussion, one-month post-concussion, or both. Thirty-eight female athletes, ages 14-18, were matched into two groups: SRC or healthy control. Self-reported symptom scores were higher among concussed females in the luteal phase, when progesterone levels are highest. Results suggest that progesterone levels may contribute to a heightened experience of symptoms during the acute phase of SRC, providing further evidence of a possible link between progesterone and symptom scores following concussion.",['Ott S; Redell J; Cheema S; Schatz P; Becker E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38314752,adolescent female athletes with sports-related concussion remain an understudied group. progesterone levels may contribute to a heightened experience of symptoms.
Effect of catheter-directed ethanol sclerotherapy on ovarian reserve in patients with recurrent endometrioma: comparative analysis with primary endometriosis.,"Catheter-directed ethanol sclerotherapy (CDS) is known to less affect the ovarian function, with comparable efficacy. This study aims to investigate the change in ovarian reserve after catheter-directed ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with recurrent endometrioma, as compared to primary endometrioma. Retrospective, observational study. Electronic medical records and images of patients with endometrioma who underwent CDS from August 2014 to April 2022 at a single institution were obtained. Patients aged > 18 years old and with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level between 0.8 and 10.0 with regular menstruation were enrolled. Cyst diameter, laterality, AMH level, and CA-125 level before and after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years of sclerotherapy were obtained. A total of 180 patients were fit for analysis. There was no statistical difference in age and cyst size between the two groups. Mean values of AMH in each group were 3.35 in the primary group and 3.00 in the recurrent group prior to the procedure (p = 0.347). There was no significant difference in delta value of AMH after sclerotherapy in both groups at each follow-up period. Also, this result was consistent when stratified by laterality, preprocedural AMH level, and initial size of endometrioma. No case of recurrence was reported in both groups. The effect of CDS on ovarian reserve is not inferior in recurrent endometrioma compared to primary endometrioma. Since sclerotherapy is known to less deteriorate the ovarian function than surgical removal of endometrioma, clinician could consider this as the first-line therapy in patients with recurrent endometrioma. Catheter-directed ethanol sclerotherapy for patients with recurrent endometrioma has similar effect on ovarian reserve compared to patients with primary endometrioma. • Secondary surgery for endometrioma has significant deleterious effect on ovarian function. • Catheter-directed sclerotherapy (CDS) for endometrioma had equally minimal adverse effect on ovarian reserve, represented as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), in both primary and recurrent groups. • Physicians should consider CDS for patients with recurrent endometrioma who desire to preserve ovarian function.",['Lee JK; Han K; Choi E; Baek J; Kim HR; Kim MD; Kim H; Seo SK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37848771,"ethanol sclerotherapy is known to less affect the ovarian function. compared to primary endometriosis, it is known to less affect the ovarian function."
Sales Revenues for New Therapeutic Agents Approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration From 1995 to 2014.,"This study aimed to analyze worldwide sales of new therapeutic agents and to estimate the time it takes for product sales to exceed industry-wide average drug development costs. Data obtained from company reports were analyzed to track worldwide sales of new medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1995 to 2014. All sales figures were reported in 2019 US dollars. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the time it took for discounted product sales to exceed the average costs associated with developing 1 new drug (accounting for the costs of failed trials), using published estimates of these costs. Based on data for 361 of 558 new therapeutic agents approved over the study period (median follow-up 13.2 years), mean sales revenue per product was $15.2 billion through the end of 2019; the median was $6.7 billion. These products jointly generated global sales of $5.5 trillion since approval. Revenues were highly skewed, with the 25 best selling products (7%, 25 of 361) accounting for 38% of this amount ($2.1 trillion of $5.5 trillion). Approximately 47% of products had discounted sales that exceeded the estimated industry-wide average costs of development within 5 years of approval, and 75% within 10 years. After attributing potential production, marketing, and other costs, these numbers dropped to 21% of products within 5 years of approval, and 46% within 10 years. Sales of new medicines approved from 1995 to 2014 were highly skewed, but many products had net discounted sales that exceeded the industry-wide average costs of development within 10 years of approval. An understanding of how sales revenues accrue in the years after initial approval, alongside data on business costs, can inform discussions about how to incentivize private investment in innovation while ensuring affordable prices for patients and the healthcare system.",['Wouters OJ; Kesselheim AS; Kuha J; Luyten J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38977188,sales figures were reported in 2019 US dollars. sales revenue per product was $15.2 billion through the end of 2019. sales of new therapeutic agents approved from 1995 to 2014 were highly skewed.
Relationship between DMFT index and reproductive history- a cross-sectional study on enrollment phase of Azar cohort study.,"Hormonal changes in women throughout life might affect the oral health. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index and reproductive history. The present cross-sectional study was performed using data of Azar Cohort Study conducted in 2014, in Shabestar city, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. In the present study, the data of all 8294 women from the enrollment phase of the Azar cohort were included. All available data related on the variables of reproductive history (including age at the onset of menstruation, age of onset of menopause, age of first pregnancy, and frequency of pregnancy), age at interview, educational level, socioeconomic status, frequency of tooth brushing, chronic diseases, body mass index and DMFT were extracted. Negative binomial regression with loglink was used to analyze the relationship between variables. Three regression models have been applied to adjust the effect of confounding variables. Model 1 adjusted for education, socio-economic status, age, chronic diseases, body mass index and frequency of tooth brushing. Model 2 adjusted for education, socioeconomic status, age, chronic diseases and body mass index. Model 3 adjusted for education, socio-economic status and age. The mean DMFT of 8294 women was 20.99 ± 8.95. In model 1, there was no significant relationship between DMFT and frequency of pregnancy. However, model 2 and 3 showed that in women who had four or more pregnancies, the DMFT rate was significantly higher than those who did not have a history of pregnancy (P = 0.02, P = 0.04). Age at the onset of menopause, age at the onset of menstruation and age of first pregnancy had no significant relationship with DMFT in the models. Brushing less than once a day and increasing age at interview had significant relationship with DMFT in the models (P < 0.001). Despite hormonal changes through the life, the history of reproductive showed no significant relationship with women's DMFT. Oral health education for women is an important step in promoting oral health and it is necessary to pay special attention to preventive programs in oral health policy for women specially with increasing the age.",['Hefzollesan S; Sharififard N; Mahboobi Z; Faramarzi E'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36403001,cross-sectional study was performed using data of azar cohort study. data of all 8294 women from the enrollment phase were included.
Volatile organic compounds from human skin as biomarkers of menstruation phase and severity of premenstrual syndrome: An exploratory pilot study.,"Numerous women of reproductive age experience physical or mental discomfort during their natural menstrual cycle due to paramenstrual symptoms, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). To date, there is no established biomarker for the diagnosis of PMS. This study investigated the relationship between skin gas composition and menstruation cycles, and evaluated the possibility of skin gas composition as a biomarker of paramenstrual symptoms. We conducted an exploratory pilot study. Healthy Japanese women (aged 20-29 years) underwent blood and skin gas analyses on 1 day corresponding to menstruation, preovulatory, middle luteal, and late luteal phases. Skin gas was collected from the cubital fossa and armpit using a Passive Flux Sampler; samples were analyzed for 65 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-parametric statistical analysis was performed to identify VOCs related to the menstrual cycle, levels of female hormones, and severity of PMS. Fourteen women participated; of those, 12 completed the study. Regarding the relationship with the menstrual cycles, seven and four VOCs were significantly and marginally changed, respectively, at the cubital fossa during menstruation. Of those 11 compounds, 10 were also correlated with the levels of serum female hormones. At the armpit, five and three compounds were significantly and marginally changed, respectively, during menstruation. Of those eight compounds, five were also correlated with the levels of serum female hormones. In the study of PMS severity, analysis of the changes in VOCs suggested that ketones and fatty acids are increased during menstruation in the severe PMS group versus the mild PMS group. The results of this study suggest that certain VOCs emitted in skin gas related to the menstrual cycle, levels of female hormones, and severity of PMS. These findings may advance the metabolic understanding and development of diagnostic biomarkers for menstruation-related symptoms.",['Fujii T; Matsuura N; Morita Y; Morimoto K'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37810044,a pilot study was conducted by a group of women of reproductive age. the study investigated the relationship between skin gas composition and menstruation cycles. there is no established biomarker for the diagnosis of PMS.
The prevalence of late-follicular phase progesterone elevation and impact on the ongoing pregnancy rate after fresh and frozen blastocyst transfer. Sub-study of an RCT.,"The effect of late-follicular phase progesterone elevation (LFPE) during ovarian stimulation on reproductive outcomes in ART treatment remains controversial, but recent studies indicate lower pregnancy rates with rising progesterone levels. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of late-follicular phase progesterone elevation (LFPE) and possible impact on ongoing pregnancy rate after fresh or frozen blastocyst transfer in a sub-study setting of a randomised controlled trial. A total of 288 women were included (n=137 and n=151 in the fresh transfer and freeze-all group, respectively). Among these 11(3.8%) had a progesterone level ≥1.5 ng/ml, and 20(6.9%) had a progesterone level ≥1.2 ng/ml on <i>trigger day</i>. Spline regression analysis showed no significant effect of late follicular phase progesterone levels on ongoing pregnancy. In the multivariate regression analysis (<i>n</i> = 312) only age, but not progesterone level on <i>trigger day</i> was significantly associated with ongoing pregnancy. In conclusion, in a clinical setting with moderate gonadotrophin stimulation and well-defined trigger and fresh transfer cancellation criteria, the prevalence of women with LFPE ≥1.5 ng/ml was low and did not indicate the clinical value of routine measurement of progesterone in the late follicular phase.",['Stormlund S; Sopa N; Lyng Forman J; Zedeler A; Bogstad J; Prætorius L; Nielsen HS; Klajnbard A; Englund AL; Ziebe S; Freiesleben NC; Bergh C; Humaidan P; Nyboe Andersen A; Pinborg A; Løssl K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38639220,study aims to investigate prevalence of late-follicular phase progesterone elevation (LFPE) during ovarian stimulation.

A qualitative study to develop a patient-reported outcome for dysmenorrhea.,"Dysmenorrhea refers to the experience of pelvic pain/cramps experienced by women around or during menstruation. A literature review indicated that no existing patient-reported outcome measure was adequate to support labeling claims in dysmenorrhea. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new measure that could be used as a primary end point in dysmenorrhea clinical trials. Open-ended interviews were conducted with 52 dysmenorrhea patients, including a subset of 12 women with a comorbid pelvic pain condition (PPC). Verbatim transcripts were analyzed thematically. The findings were used to generate draft items for an electronic diary (eDiary). A further 24 dysmenorrhea patients pilot-tested the eDiary for 1-5 weeks and completed cognitive interviews to assess content validity. Revisions to the eDiary were implemented based on the findings. In the first set of interviews, 51 women (98 %) spontaneously reported pain/cramps in or around the pelvic region (abdomen, lower back, legs/upper thighs, and vaginal area). Pain experiences reported were similar across dysmenorrhea and dysmenorrhea plus PPC subgroups, except that the pelvic pain among PPC patients occurred throughout the month, not only during menstruation. All participants described the detrimental impact of dysmenorrhea on health-related quality of life. The eDiary was conceptually comprehensive and easy to complete/understand during cognitive debriefing. The resulting nine-item diary included assessment of: menstrual bleeding severity; pain severity; use of analgesics; impact on work/school, physical activities, social and leisure activities, and sleep. Psychometric validation is ongoing and will assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the eDiary as a comprehensive dysmenorrhea assessment.",['Nguyen AM; Humphrey L; Kitchen H; Rehman T; Norquist JM'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25048731,dysmenorrhea refers to pelvic pain/cramps experienced by women around or during menstruation. no existing patient-reported outcome measure was adequate to support labeling claims in dysmenorrhea.
"""I still don't know how someone gets pregnant"": determinants of poor reproductive health among young female refugees in South Africa.","Studies exploring the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of refugee women have focused primarily on first generation refugees in humanitarian and crisis settings. There is a paucity of research exploring the reproductive health of girls and young women who are born to refugee parents in a host country or who have migrated with their parents at a very young age and who have since reached sexual maturity. We conducted a qualitative study which aimed to explore the reproductive health and rights' needs and challenges amongst young refugee women in South Africa. The study was carried out in the city of eThekwini (Durban) in South Africa in 2021 and 2022. A total of 35 semi-structured, in person interviews were conducted amongst young refugee women between the ages of 18 and 24 years living in the city centre. Twenty-five participants were 17 years or younger on arriving in South Africa, one of whom was born in South Africa. Eleven of these women had experienced one or more pregnancies while living in South Africa and all of these women had experienced at least one unintended pregnancy. Participants had poor reproductive health knowledge of the role of menstruation and how conception occurs. Economic, social, and legal insecurities intersected in complex ways as determinants of poor reproductive health outcomes. Despite availability, contraceptive use was poor and linked to lack of knowledge, myths and unwanted side effects. There were negative economic and social impacts for young refugee women experiencing early pregnancies irrespective of whether they were intended or not. Being unable to conceive or experiencing an unintended pregnancy negatively impacted sexual relationships which were entered primarily for material support. Desire for confidentiality shaped lack of access to legal termination of pregnancy in the public health sector. Participants experienced specific vulnerabilities resulting from their position as refugees despite length of stay in South Africa. It is important to better understand these specificities in the design of programmes and policies aimed at ensuring positive health outcomes for these young women. Peer education amongst refugee communities may be an important tool in the provision of culturally acceptable SRH education.",['Crankshaw TL; Freedman J; Mutambara VM; Rajah Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38172790,studies exploring sexual and reproductive health of refugee women focus on first generation refugees. study aimed to explore reproductive health and rights' needs and challenges among young refugee women in south africa. twenty-five participants were 17 years or younger on arriving in south Africa.
"""Bitten By Shyness"": Menstrual Hygiene Management, Sanitation, and the Quest for Privacy in South Africa.","Little is known about how menstruation is managed in low-income settings and whether existing sanitation systems meet women's needs. Using the 'Photovoice' method with 21 women in participatory workshops and in-depth interviews, we collected data on menstrual hygiene management in three sites in Durban, South Africa. All women reported using disposable sanitary pads. Although they were aware that disposable pads were nonbiodegradable, incompatible with waterborne flush systems, and fill up pit latrines, they had little experience with reusable products. Considerable energy was devoted to concealing and containing 'menstrual waste,' and women expressed concern about inadequate privacy during menstruation. All sites lacked discreet disposal options and reliable water access, while outdoor sanitation facilities were considered unsafe.

Mediterranean Diet Combined With a Low-Carbohydrate Dietary Pattern in the Treatment of Overweight Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients.,"To determine the therapeutic effect of a Mediterranean diet (MED) combined with a low-carbohydrate (LC) dietary model in overweight polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. In this 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial, 72 overweight patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to one of two energy-restricted dietary models: the MED/LC diet or the Low fat (LF) diet. After the intervention, the number of the two groups returned to normal menstruation was counted. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage (BF%), serum fasting insulin(FINS), fasting plasma glucose(FPG), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity index (QUIKI), total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (PRL) were compared between 2 groups before and after intervention. MED/LC group had more significant reduction trend in weight (-6.10 ± 1.52 kg vs -4.79 ± 0.97 kg, <i>P</i> < 0.05), BMI (-2.12 ± 0.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs -1.78 ± 0.36 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i> < 0.05), WC (-6.12 ± 5.95 cm vs -3.90 ± 1.58 cm, <i>P</i> < 0.05), WHR (-0.06 ± 0.02 vs -0.03 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.05), BF% (-2.97% ± 1.78% vs -1.19% ± 0.91%, <i>P</i> < 0.05), TT (-0.20 ± 0.24 ng/mL vs 0.08 ± 0.11 ng/Ml, <i>P</i> < 0.001), LH (-5.28 ± 3.31 mIU/mL vs -3.39 ± 3.64 mIU/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and LH/FSH (-1.18 ± 0.75 vs -0.66 ± 1.05, <i>P</i> < 0.05) compared with the LF group. In addition, FPG (0.05 ± 0.38 mmol/mL vs -0.50 ± 1.01 mmol/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.001), FINS (-4.88 ± 6.11 μU/mL vs -8.53 ± 5.61 μU/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.01), HOMA-IR index (-1.11 ± 1.51 vs -2.23 ± 0.25, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and QUIKI index (0.014 ± 0.016 vs 0.028 ± 0.019, <i>P</i> < 0.05) decreased significantly in the MED/LC group compared with the LF group. Comparing the changes in lipid parameters between the two groups (LF vs MED/LC), significant differences in TG (-0.33 ± 0.32 mmol vs -0.76 ± 0.97 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05), TC (-0.40 ± 1.00 mmol vs -1.45 ± 2.00 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and LDL-C (-0.41 ± 1.05 mmol vs -0.73 ± 0.76 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05) were observed. The results of this study suggest that the MED/LC diet model is a good treatment for overweight PCOS patients, significantly restoring their menstrual cycle, improving their anthropometric parameters and correcting their disturbed endocrine levels, and its overall effectiveness is significantly better than the LF diet model.

Dysmenorrhea: Prevalence and Impact on Quality of Life among Young Adult Jordanian Females.,"To establish the prevalence and impact on quality of life of dysmenorrhea among young adult Jordanian females. Cross-sectional study based on quantitative self-reported anonymous questionnaire. University-based study. A total of 272 female medical students (aged 19-25 years). None. Self-reports of menstruation-related pain symptoms and methods of dealing with them. Of study subjects 152/272 (55.8%) participants had moderate and severe dysmenorrhea. Of them, 55.8% had a family history of severe dysmenorrhea compared with 33.1% of those without dysmenorrhea (χ2 = 13.40, df = 1, P < .001). There was strong association between severity of dysmenorrhea and poor university attendance (χ(2) = 45.35, df = 2, P < .001), poor social activities (χ2 = 32.06, df = 2, P < .001), poor relationships with family (χ2 = 18.46, df = 2, P < .001) and friends (χ2 = 19.14, df = 2, P < .001), and poor sport activities (χ2 = 12.15, df = 2, P = .002). Dysmenorrhea worsens during examination periods in 50% of cases. The most common pain symptom was low back pain (60.2%). Body mass index, family monthly income and early age at menarche had no correlation with the occurrence of dysmenorrhea. Of those with dysmenorrhea, 69.4% were using analgesics.

The spatial organization of ascending auditory pathway microstructural maturation from infancy through adolescence using a novel fiber tracking approach.,"Auditory perception is established through experience-dependent stimuli exposure during sensitive developmental periods; however, little is known regarding the structural development of the central auditory pathway in humans. The present study characterized the regional developmental trajectories of the ascending auditory pathway from the brainstem to the auditory cortex from infancy through adolescence using a novel diffusion MRI-based tractography approach and along-tract analyses. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to quantify the magnitude and timing of auditory pathway microstructural maturation. We found spatially varying patterns of white matter maturation along the length of the tract, with inferior brainstem regions developing earlier than thalamocortical projections and left hemisphere tracts developing earlier than the right. These results help to characterize the processes that give rise to functional auditory processing and may provide a baseline for detecting abnormal development.",['Lynch KM; Bodison SC; Cabeen RP; Toga AW; Voelker CCJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38915661,the ascending auditory pathway microstructural maturation from infancy through adolescence. the region of the ascending auditory pathway is characterized by experience-dependent stimuli exposure during sensitive developmental periods.
Creatine Promotes Endometriosis by Inducing Ferroptosis Resistance via Suppression of PrP.,"Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, significantly impairs the quality of life of women in their reproductive years; however, its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The accumulation of retrograde menstruation and recurrent bleeding fosters a high-iron environment in ectopic lesions, triggering ferroptosis in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EESCs), thereby hindering the establishment of endometriosis. However, abnormal EESCs demonstrate resistance to ferroptosis in high-iron environments, promoting the progression of this disease. Here, novel findings on the accumulation of creatine, derived from endogenous synthesis, in both peritoneal fluid and EESCs of patients with endometriosis are presented. Creatine supplementation reduces cellular iron concentrations, mitigating oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, thereby enhancing cell viability and preventing ferroptosis under high-iron conditions. Utilizing the drug affinity-responsive target stabilization (DARTS) assay, prion protein (PrP) as a potential creatine-sensing protein is identified. Mechanistically, creatine binds to the active site of PrP, inhibits the conversion of trivalent iron to divalent iron, and decreases iron uptake, promoting the tolerance of EESCs to ferroptosis. This interaction contributes to the development of endometriosis. The novel association between creatine and ferroptosis provides valuable insights into the role of creatine in endometriosis progression and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for endometriosis.",['Chen S; Ma X; Liu Y; Zhong Z; Wei C; Li M; Zhu X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39119937,Creatine promotes endometriosis by promoting Ferroptosis Resistance via Suppression of PrP. ectopic lesions triggered ferroptosis in high-iron environments. a prion protein (PrP) is a potential creatine-sensing protein.
"Efficacy and Safety of Ganyushu Granule in Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome with Gan (Liver) Depression and Qi Stagnation Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multi-Center, Phase-II Clinical Trial.","To confirm the efficacy and safety of Ganyushu Granule (GYSG) in treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in patients with Gan (Liver) depression and qi stagnation syndrome (GDQSS) and determine its effective dosage. From June 2018 to March 2021, a total of 240 PMS women with GDQSS were included and randomly divided into 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio using central block randomization: high-dose GYSG group (n=78, GYSG 2 packs/time), low-dose GYSG group (n=82, GYSG and its simulant 1 pack/time), and placebo group (n=80, GYSG simulant 2 packs/time). Treatment with GYSG or placebo was given thrice daily and for up to 3 menstrual cycles. Primary outcomes were PMS diary (PMSD) score and premenstrual tension syndrome self-rating scale (PMTS). Secondary outcomes were Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome efficacy. PMSD, PMTS, and efficacy of CM were evaluated with menstrual cycles during the treatment period. Outcome indicators were analyzed after each menstrual cycle. All analyses were performed using an intention-to-treat method, and clinical safety was assessed. Of the 216 patients included in the effectiveness analysis, 70, 75, and 71 patients were in the high-, low-dose GYSG, and placebo groups, respectively. From the 2nd treatment cycle, the change in PMSD scores in the high- and low-dose groups was lower than that in the placebo group (P<0.05). PMTS scores in the high-dose GYSG group after the 1st treatment cycle was lower than that in the placebo group (P<0.05), while after the 3rd treatment cycle, that in the low-dose group was lower than that in the placebo group (P<0.05). After the 2nd treatment cycle, the high-dose GYSG group had the best CM syndrome efficacy (P<0.05). No serious adverse reactions were reported.

Iron-deficiency Anemia Treatment with Ferric Carboxymaltose: A Real-world Quasi-experimental Study from Bangladesh.,"Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause of iron deficiency in adult men and menstrual blood loss is the leading cause of iron insufficiency in women, anemia due to iron deficiency is mostly caused by blood loss. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a contemporary parenteral iron formulation that may be used therapeutically to treat anemia caused by an iron deficiency [iron-deficiency anemia (IDA)]. The main goal of the trial was to evaluate FCM's safety and efficacy in treating IDA. The Department of Hematology, Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, Rajshahi, Bangladesh participated in this quasi-experimental research, which comprised adult patients with IDA. Participants were given an intravenous (IV) infusion of 500 mg of FCM, diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline, throughout a 30-minute period after their participation. The second dosage of FCM was administered after a 7-day period of the first dose. The comparison of the outcomes [hemoglobin (Hb) level, serum ferritin level, and other hematological parameters] between the baseline and day 14 postintervention was done using a paired <i>t</i>-test. Compared to baseline, patients' Hb levels rose considerably (<i>p</i> = 0.001) after FCM. Aside from serum ferritin level, additional hematological parameters that sharply increased were red blood cells (RBCs) count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width - coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and iron indicators. The experiment recorded mild adverse effects such as fever, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues including vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, but no significant adverse events. In summary, IDA may be effectively treated with FCM, a safe and secure IV medication that has no major negative effects. Miah MMZ, Pramanik MEA, Rafi A, <i>et al</i>.

"Low and High-Normal <i>FMR1</i> Triplet Cytosine, Guanine Guanine Repeats Affect Ovarian Reserve and Fertility in Women Who Underwent <i>In Vitro</i> Fertilization Treatment? Results from a Cross-Sectional Study.","Dynamic mutations in the 5' untranslated region of <i>FMR1</i> are associated with infertility. Premutation alleles interfere with prenatal development and increase infertility risks. The number of CGG repeats that causes the highest decrease in ovarian reserves remains unclear. We evaluated the effect of <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat lengths on ovarian reserves and <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) treatment outcomes in 272 women with alleles within the normal range. <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat length was investigated via PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Alleles were classified as low-normal, normal, and high-normal. Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were measured, and antral follicles (AFC) were counted. IVF outcomes were collected from medical records. Regarding <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat length alleles, 63.2% of women presented at least one low-normal allele. Those carrying low-normal alleles had significantly lower AMH levels than women carrying normal or high-normal alleles. Low-normal/low-normal genotype was the most frequent, followed by low-normal/normal and normal/normal. A comparison of ovarian reserve markers and reproductive outcomes of the three most frequent genotypes revealed that AFC in the low-normal/normal genotype was significantly lower than the low-normal/low-normal genotype.

"Prevalence, Wellbeing, and Symptoms of Dysmenorrhea among University Nursing Students in Greece.","Dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) is one of the most common medical conditions among women of reproductive age. Dysmenorrhea has been studied around the world but not yet in Greece. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of dysmenorrhea on the wellbeing (exercising, and social and academic functioning) among nursing students in Greece. A cross-sectional study of 637 nursing students was conducted by administering a questionnaire at a university in Athens. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 89.2% and the rate of severe intensity was 52.5%. Factors that were associated with severe dysmenorrhea were family history (<i>p</i> = 0.02), early menarche (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and menstruation duration (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Women with moderate and severe pain reported using pain relievers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol etc., <i>p <</i> 0.0005). Finally, activities affected by severe pain were class attendance (<i>p</i> = 0.01), personal studying (<i>p</i> < 0.0005), exercising (<i>p</i> < 0.0005), and socializing (<i>p</i> < 0.0005). Exam attendance (<i>p</i> = 0.27) and clinical placement attendance (<i>p</i> = 0.48) were not affected by severe dysmenorrhea.

Does the rate of orthodontic tooth movement change during the estrus cycle? A systematic review based on animal studies.,"As the fluctuation of sex hormone levels in menstruating women results in periodical effects in bone metabolism, understanding the implications for tooth movement could be of benefit to the orthodontist. This type of research presents practical and ethical problems in humans, but animal models could provide useful information. Our objective was to systematically investigate the available evidence on the question whether the rate of orthodontic tooth movement varies between the different stages of the estrus cycle in animals. Unrestricted searches in 7 databases and manual searching of the reference lists in relevant studies were performed up to February 2021 (Medline [PubMed], CENTRAL [Cochrane Library; includes records from Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO's ICTRP, KoreaMed, Cochrane Review Groups' Specialized Registers, and records identified by handsearching], Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [Cochrane Library], Scopus, Web of Knowledge [including Web of Science Core Collection, KCI Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, SciELO Citation Index and Zoological Record], Arab World Research Source [EBSCO] and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses [ProQuest]). Our search focused on prospective controlled animal studies, whose samples included female subjects of any species that were quantitatively comparing the amount of tooth movement in the different stages of the estrus cycle. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data was extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool. From the finally assessed records, 3 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two of the studies experimented on Wistar rats, whereas the other on cats. Tooth movement was induced by expansion or coil springs. The rate of orthodontic tooth movement was increased during the stages of the estrus cycle when oestrogen and/or progesterone levels were lower. The risk of bias in the retrieved studies was assessed to be unclear. Hormonal changes during the estrus cycle may affect the rate of orthodontic tooth movement. Although these animal experiment results should be approached cautiously regarding their translational potential, it could be useful to consider the possible impact of these physiological changes in the clinical setting until more information becomes available.

"""How can we leave the traditions of our Baab Daada"" socio-cultural structures and values driving menstrual hygiene management challenges in schools in Pakistan.","Despite the growing attention to the relationship between menstruation and girls schooling, there remain many challenges to addressing the issue. Current interventions, which mostly focus on developing WASH infrastructure and sanitary hygiene management products, while necessary, may not be sufficient. This paper aimed to identify the root causes of poorly maintained WASH infrastructure, and understand the deeply embedded socio-cultural values around menstrual hygiene management that need to be addressed in order to provide truly supportive school environments for menstruating girls. Qualitative data were collected in rural and urban sites in three provinces in Pakistan using participatory activities with 312 girls aged 16-19 years, observations of 7 School WASH facilities, 42 key informant interviews and a document review. Three key themes emerged from our data: (1) a poorly maintained, girls-unfriendly School WASH infrastructure was a result of gender-insensitive design, a cultural devaluation of toilet cleaners and inadequate governing practices; (2) the design of WASH facilities did not align with traditionally-determined modes of disposal of rag-pads, the most common used absorbents; (3) traditional menstrual management practices situate girls in an 'alternate space' characterised by withdrawal from many daily routines. These three socio-culturally determined practices interacted in a complex manner, often leading to interrupted class engagement and attendance.

Limited but promising data suggest the potential efficacy of antiprogestins in breast cancer prevention. The present study presents secondary outcomes from a randomized controlled trial and examines changes in breast mRNA expression following mifepristone treatment in healthy premenopausal women. We analyzed 32 paired breast biopsies from 16 women at baseline and after two months of mifepristone treatment. In total, 27 differentially expressed genes were identified, with enriched biological functions related to extracellular matrix remodeling. Notably, the altered gene signature induced by mifepristone in vivo was rather similar to the in vitro signature. Furthermore, this gene expression signature was linked to breast carcinogenesis and notably linked with progesterone receptor expression status in breast cancer, as validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset using the R2 platform. The present study is the first to explore the breast transcriptome following mifepristone treatment in normal breast tissue in vivo, enhancing the understanding of progesterone receptor antagonism and its potential protective effect against breast cancer.",['Utjés D; Boggavarapu NR; Rasul MF; Koberg I; Zulliger A; Ponandai-Srinivasan S; von Grothusen C; Lalitkumar PG; Papaikonomou K; Alkasalias T; Gemzell-Danielsson K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39062832,progesterone receptor antagonism is gaining attention due to progesterone's recognized role as a major mitogen in breast tissue. limited but promising data suggest the potential efficacy of antiprogestins in breast cancer prevention.
Effects of Quality of Integrity on Clinical and Structural Outcomes of Rotator Cuff Repair: A Retrospective Cohort Study of 504 Cases.,"The clinical implications of structural integrity have been a subject of long debate. The oversimplified binary categorization of structural integrity into either healing or retear, along with faulty preoperative baselines for comparison, may contribute to the controversy. To determine how the quality of structural integrity in a repaired cuff tendon affects both clinical and structural outcomes by dividing the patients into groups based on integrity and using the immediate postoperative baseline (time zero). Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A total of 504 patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and were followed up for at least a year with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. The quality of structural integrity was graded using the Sugaya classification. To evaluate clinical outcomes, pain, range of motion, strength, functional scores, and overall satisfaction and function were used for within- and between-group analyses at the last follow-up. For the assessment of structural outcomes, the Goutallier classification for fatty infiltration (FI) and the tangent sign, occupation ratio, and normalized cross-sectional area for muscle atrophy (MA) were used. The baselines for these structural measurements were both the preoperative and the time-zero MRI scans. The mean clinical follow-up period was 31.8 ± 27.5 months, and the MRI follow-up period was 10.9 ± 5.3 months. There were 178 (35.3%), 228 (45.2%), 58 (11.5%), 14 (2.8%), and 26 (5.2%) shoulders with Sugaya grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Regardless of structural integrity, all clinical outcomes at a mean follow-up of 31.8 months after repair significantly improved compared with those before repair. Only in shoulders with Sugaya grade 1 did the FI of the supraspinatus muscle improve significantly from baseline. FI of the infraspinatus muscle did not change significantly in those with grades 1 and 2 but worsened in those with grades 3 and 5. MA measured using the occupation ratio improved significantly in shoulders with Sugaya grades 1 and 2 but declined in those with grade 5. This study established a correlation between improved structural integrity of the repaired cuff tendon and enhanced structural outcomes in rotator cuff muscles. Furthermore, the findings revealed that both FI and MA could be reversed in patients exhibiting high-quality structural integrity. However, these structural improvements were not mirrored in the clinical outcomes.",['Jo CH; Lee JI; Kim K; Ahn E; Oh S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39101731,structural integrity is a clinical and structural issue. the faulty preoperative baselines for comparison may contribute to the controversy. the quality of structural integrity in a repaired cuff tendon was graded using the Sugaya classification.
Prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and its associations with dietary and other lifestyle factors among university female students in Dubai: A cross-sectional study.,"Premenstrual syndrome is a relatively prevalent condition that affects a significant number of menstruating women worldwide. It can range from mild to severe and may interfere with daily activities. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and its associated factors among female university students in Dubai. This study was designed as a cross-sectional study. The analysis for this study involved 217 female university students (aged ⩾18 years old) who completed a self-reported online questionnaire. Participants were recruited through simple random sampling, and the study received ethical approval from the Zayed University Ethical Committee. All participants reported that they experienced at least one premenstrual syndrome symptom with different levels of severity. The prevalence rate of psychological, physical, and behavioral symptoms was 83.0%, 79.4%, and 76.6%, respectively. The most frequently reported premenstrual psychological symptoms were loss of control (69.6%). Most reported physical premenstrual symptoms included lethargy/fatigue/decreased energy (56.7%); premenstrual syndrome symptoms interfered with participants' daily routines (45.2%). Normal body mass index, no smoking, milk consumption, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, animal foods, fish oil supplements, and no fast-food consumption were all significant factors associated with decreasing premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual syndrome is a common menstrual disorder among university students that interferes with their daily routines. Dietary habits and other lifestyle factors were highly related to premenstrual syndrome. Therefore, health promotion programs are highly recommended to encourage healthy diets and lifestyles for females as early as adolescence at the school level.",['Al Sabbah H; Al Mutawa N; Assaf EA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38819884,"premenstrual syndrome affects a significant number of menstruating women worldwide. it can range from mild to severe and may interfere with daily activities. the prevalence rate of psychological, physical, and behavioral symptoms was 83.0%, 79.4%, and 76.6%, respectively."
Sex hormone mediated change on flexion reflex.,"It has been shown that estrogen and progesterone receptors are expressed in the spinal cord; therefore, fluctuation in their concentrations may affect the spinal network and modulate the control of movement. Herein, we assessed the neuro-modulatory effect of sex hormones on the polysynaptic spinal network by using a flexion reflex network as a model system. Twenty-four healthy eumenorrheic women (age 21-37 years) were tested every other day for one menstrual cycle. Serum estradiol and progesterone were acquired at the time of testing. The flexion reflex of the tibialis anterior was elicited by sending an innocuous electrical stimulus directly to the posterior tibial nerve or plantar cutaneous afferent. Analyses were performed for each menstrual cycle phase: the follicular phase and the luteal phase. Increases in estradiol or progesterone concentrations were not associated with reflex duration or root mean squared (RMS) amplitude in either the follicular or luteal phases. In the luteal phase, an increase in the estradiol concentration was associated with a longer latency of the reflex (<i>b</i> = 0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.038). The estradiol × progesterone interaction was found towards significance (<i>b</i> = -0.017, <i>p</i> = 0.081). These results highlight the potential synergistic effect of estradiol and progesterone and may provide indirect confirmatory evidence of the observed modulatory effect.",['Soedirdjo SDH; Chung YC; Dhaher YY'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38188036,flexion reflex network was used as model system to assess the neuro-modulatory effect of sex hormones on the polysynaptic spinal network. twenty-four healthy eumenorrheic women (age 21-37 years) were tested every other day for one menstrual cycle.
Virtual Clinic Telehealth Abortion Services in the United States One Year After Dobbs: Landscape Review.,"Telehealth abortion has taken on a vital role in maintaining abortion access since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court decision. However, little remains known about the landscape of new telehealth-only virtual clinic abortion providers that have expanded since telehealth abortion first became widely available in the United States in 2021. This study aimed to (1) document the landscape of telehealth-only virtual clinic abortion care in the United States, (2) describe changes in the presence of virtual clinic abortion services between September 2022, following the Dobbs decision, and June 2023, and (3) identify structural factors that may perpetuate inequities in access to virtual clinic abortion care. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study by reviewing web search results and abortion directories to identify virtual abortion clinics in September 2022 and June 2023 and described changes in the presence of virtual clinics between these 2 periods. In June 2023, we also described each virtual clinic's policies, including states served, costs, patient age limits, insurance acceptance, financial assistance available, and gestational limits. We documented 11 virtual clinics providing telehealth abortion care in 26 states and Washington DC in September 2022. By June 2023, 20 virtual clinics were providing services in 27 states and Washington DC. Most (n=16) offered care to minors, 8 provided care until 10 weeks of pregnancy, and median costs were US $259. In addition, 2 accepted private insurance and 1 accepted Medicaid, within a limited number of states. Most (n=16) had some form of financial assistance available. Virtual clinic abortion providers have proliferated since the Dobbs decision. We documented inequities in the availability of telehealth abortion care from virtual clinics, including age restrictions that exclude minors, gestational limits for care, and limited insurance and Medicaid acceptance. Notably, virtual clinic abortion care was not permitted in 11 states where in-person abortion is available.",['Koenig LR; Ko J; Upadhyay UD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39102679,virtual clinic abortion services in the united states have expanded since 2021. study aims to document the landscape of telehealth-only virtual clinic abortion care. it describes changes in the presence of virtual clinic abortion services between 2022 and 2023.
Clusterin expression and distribution in spermatozoa as predictor of male fertility.,"Clusterin (CLU), one of the main glycoproteins in mammalian semen and the male reproductive tract, plays a role in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. Given the poor reliability of classic seminal studies in determining male-fertilizing capacity and the differences in CLU abundance between normal and abnormal spermatozoa, we investigated the potential value of mRNA-CLU levels and protein distribution in spermatozoa as markers of sperm quality and predictors of male fertility. This multicenter study included 90 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment with their partners, and a control group of 36 fertile males with normal seminograms. We assessed the relationship between IVF treatment outcomes, seminogram variables, mRNA-CLU levels by quantitative real-time-PCR and CLU distribution by immunostaining in spermatozoa. Our study reveals CLU staining in the acrosome (p = 0.002, OR 14.8, 95% CI: 2.7-79.3) and mRNA-CLU levels (p = 0.005, OR 10.85, 95% CI: 2.0-57.4) as independent risk factors for pregnancy failure, irrespective of traditional seminogram variables. Additionally, our results suggest that CLU, and specially its secreted isoform, constitutes a component of the protein pool that human spermatozoa can produce during its maturation process, exhibiting a variable abundance and distribution in spermatozoa from fertile men compared to those in patients with altered seminograms and infertile patients with normal seminograms. Our study is the first to identify mRNA-CLU levels and CLU immunostaining in the spermatozoa acrosome as independent risk factors for pregnancy failure, with distribution patterns correlating with sperm maturity and seminogram alterations.",['Hernández-Herrador M; Marilina GA; Luisa Hortas M; Carrillo-Lucena S; Caracuel Z; Castilla-Alcalá JA; Martín-García D; Redondo M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39072963,clusterin (CLU) plays a role in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. mRNA-CLU levels and protein distribution in spermatozoa are markers of sperm quality and predictors of male fertility.
RBD amplicon sequencing of wastewater reveals patterns of variant emergence and evolution.,"Rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the emergence of numerous variants, posing significant challenges to public health surveillance. Clinical genome sequencing, while valuable, has limitations in capturing the full epidemiological dynamics of circulating variants in the general population. This study utilized receptor-binding domain (RBD) amplicon sequencing of wastewater samples to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 community dynamics and evolution in El Paso, TX. Over 17 months, we identified 91 variants and observed waves of dominant variants transitioning from BA.2 to BA.2.12.1, BA.4&5, BQ.1, and XBB.1.5. Our findings demonstrated early detection of variants and identification of unreported outbreaks, while showing strong consistency with clinical genome sequencing data at the local, state, and national levels. Alpha diversity analyses revealed significant periodical variations, with the highest diversity observed in winter and the outbreak lag phases, likely due to lower competition among variants before the outbreak growth phase. The data underscores the importance of low transmission periods for rapid mutation and variant evolution. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating RBD amplicon sequencing with wastewater surveillance in tracking viral evolution, understanding variant emergence, and enhancing public health preparedness.",['Chen X; Balliew J; Bauer CX; Deegan J; Gitter A; Hanson BM; Maresso AW; Tisza MJ; Troisi CL; Rios J; Mena KD; Boerwinkle E; Wu F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39040200,"rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in emergence of variants. clinical genome sequencing has limitations in capturing the full epidemiological dynamics of circulating variants in the general population. over 17 months, we identified 91 variants and observed waves of dominant variants transitioning from BA.2 to BA.2.12.1, BA.4&5, BQ.1 and XBB.1.5."
Recovery of uterine and ovarian function in patients with complete placenta previa after caesarean delivery: A retrospective study.,"This retrospective study was designed to explore the recovery of uterine and ovarian function in patients with complete placenta previa (PP) after caesarean delivery (CD). 136 complete placenta previa patients (group completed placenta previa) and 140 patients without complete PP (group non-PP, control group) were included in this study from Jan 2016 to Dec 2018. Subgroup analysis of patients with complete PP was made to determine the impact of different hemostatic methods used during CD on the recovery of uterine function. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in postpartum menstrual cycle changes, ovarian hormone, and uterine vascular supply as measured by pulsatility index and systolic/diastolic ratio (P > .05). However, the group with complete PP had a reduced endometrial thickness (0.47 ± 0.11 vs 0.50 ± 0.12, P < .001), a lower uterine resistance index at 42nd days (0.84 ± 0.03 vs 0.90 ± 0.03, P < .001), and a delayed resumption menstruation (7.07 ± 2.61 vs 5.31 ± 2.16, P < .001) when compared with control group. Subgroup analysis showed that RI index of all subgroups in completed PP group was lower, endometrial thickness was thinner and the time to menstrual recovery was longer than that of non-PP group. In conclusion, the endometrial thickness and blood supply at 42nd days, not ovarian function, maybe affected after CD in patients with complete PP.",['Li X; Musoba PM; Zhou X; Lai S; Yang W; Wang LN; Chantholleng DD; Zhao J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466195,"retrospective study was designed to explore the recovery of uterine and ovarian function in patients with complete placenta previa (PP) after caesarean delivery (CD) 136 complete placenta previa patients (group completed placenta previa) and 140 patients without complete PP (group non-PP, control group) were included in this study from Jan 2016 to Dec 2018."
"Flexible decision-making is related to strategy learning, vicarious trial and error, and medial prefrontal rhythms during spatial set-shifting.","Flexible decision-making requires a balance between exploring features of an environment and exploiting prior knowledge. Behavioral flexibility is typically measured by how long it takes subjects to consistently make accurate choices after reward contingencies switch or task rules change. This measure, however, only allows for tracking flexibility across multiple trials, and does not assess the degree of flexibility. Plus, although increases in decision-making accuracy are strong indicators of learning, other decision-making behaviors have also been suggested as markers of flexibility, such as the on-the-fly decision reversals known as vicarious trial and error (VTE) or switches to a different, but incorrect, strategy. We sought to relate flexibility, learning, and neural activity by comparing choice history-derived evaluation of strategy use with changes in decision-making accuracy and VTE behavior while recording from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. Using a set-shifting task that required rats to repeatedly switch between spatial decision-making strategies, we show that a previously developed strategy likelihood estimation procedure could identify putative learning points based on decision history. We confirm the efficacy of learning point estimation by showing increases in decision-making accuracy aligned to the learning point. Additionally, we show increases in the rate of VTE behavior surrounding identified learning points. By calculating changes in strategy likelihoods across trials, we tracked flexibility on a trial-by-trial basis and show that flexibility scores also increased around learning points. Further, we demonstrate that VTE behaviors could be separated into indecisive and deliberative subtypes depending on whether they occurred during periods of high or low flexibility and whether they led to correct or incorrect choice outcomes. Field potential recordings from the mPFC during decisions exhibited increased beta band activity on trials with VTE compared to non-VTE trials, as well as increased gamma during periods when learned strategies could be exploited compared to prelearning, exploratory periods. This study demonstrates that increased behavioral flexibility and VTE rates are often aligned to task learning. These relationships can break down, however, suggesting that VTE is not always an indicator of deliberative decision-making. Additionally, we further implicate the mPFC in decision-making and learning by showing increased beta-based activity on VTE trials and increased gamma after learning.",['Miles JT; Mullins GL; Mizumori SJY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39038921,flexible decision-making requires a balance between exploring features of an environment and exploiting prior knowledge.

Green gram soup and barley porridge as dietary interventions for management of premenstrual syndrome in adolescent girl: A case report.,"Women suffer from various conditions related to menstrual cycle due to changing lifestyle, bad food habits, physical and mental stress. Pre Menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that many women get one or two weeks before the start of their menstrual period. In the present study, 14 years old female patient having symptoms-lower abdominal pain, backache, breast tenderness, constipation, pimples, tiredness and unexplained anger typically in luteal phase from last 4 months, was diagnosed with mild to moderate symptoms of PMS. After proper analysis, she was suggested to consume light to digest dietary articles advised in classical texts for minimizing specific symptoms during menstruation.Thus Green gram Soup and Barley porridge was prescribed to her as lunch and dinner respectively for first three days of menstruation cycle for continuous 6 cycles. It is observed that consumption of these dietary products during the menstruation time period assisted to minimize the symptoms of PMS. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the ayurvedic dietary regimen recommended during menstruation which can be used more rationally to suit menstrual disorders.",['Abhijeet Shirkande A; Pawar M; Sarjerao Shirkande A; Yeola G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914046,"women suffer from various conditions related to menstrual cycle. the symptoms are often attributed to changing lifestyle, bad food habits, physical and mental stress."
Tracking cognitive trajectories in older survivors of COVID-19 up to 2.5 years post-infection.,"Emerging evidence suggests that neurological and other post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 can persist beyond or develop following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the long-term trajectories of cognitive change after a COVID-19 infection remain unclear. Here we investigated cognitive changes over a period of 2.5 years among 1,245 individuals aged 60 years or older who survived infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain in Wuhan, China, and 358 uninfected spouses. We show that the overall incidence of cognitive impairment among older COVID-19 survivors was 19.1% at 2.5 years after infection and hospitalization, evaluated using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-40. Cognitive decline primarily manifested in individuals with severe COVID-19 during the initial year of infection, after which the rate of decline decelerated. Severe COVID-19, cognitive impairment at 6 months and hypertension were associated with long-term cognitive decline. These findings reveal the long-term cognitive trajectory of the disease and underscore the importance of post-infection cognitive care for COVID-19 survivors.",['Liu YH; Wu QX; Wang QH; Zhang QF; Tang Y; Liu D; Wang JJ; Liu XY; Wang LR; Li L; Xu C; Zhu J; Wang YJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38987646,"cognitive changes over 2.5 years were observed among 1,245 survivors. the overall incidence of cognitive impairment was 19.1% at 2.5 years after infection."
Resource pulses shape seasonal and individual variation in the diet of an omnivorous carnivore.,"Resource pulses are ecologically important phenomenon that occur in most ecosystems globally. Following optimal foraging theory, many consumers switch to pulsatile foods when available, examples of which include fruit mast and vulnerable young prey. Yet how the availability of resource pulses shapes the ecology of predators is still an emerging area of research; and how much individual variation there is in response to pulses is not well understood. We hypothesized that resource pulses would lead to dietary convergence in our population, which we tested by tracking both population-level and individual coyote diets for 3 years in South Carolina, USA. We (1) described seasonal dietary shifts in relation to resource pulses; (2) compared male and female diets across seasons; and (3) tested this dietary convergence hypothesis by quantifying individual dietary variation both across and within periods when resource pulses were available. We found that pulses of white-tailed deer fawns and blackberries composed over half of coyote diet in summer, and persimmon fruits were an important component in fall. Male and female coyotes generally had similar diets, but males consumed more deer in fall, perhaps driven by scavenging more. We found support for our dietary convergence hypothesis, where individuals had more similar diets during resource pulses compared to a non-pulse period. We also found that this convergence happened before peak availability, suggesting a non-symmetric response to pulse availability. We show that nearly all coyotes eat fawns, suggesting that targeted efforts to remove ""fawn killers"" would be in vain. Instead, given how quickly coyotes collectively converge on resource pulses, our findings show that resource pulses could potentially be used by managers to alter the behavior of apex predators. More broadly, we open a new line of inquiry into how variation in individual foraging decisions scales up to shape the effects of resource pulses on ecological communities.",['Jensen AJ; Muthersbaugh M; Ruth CR; Butfiloski JW; Cantrell J; Adams J; Waits L; Kilgo JC; Jachowski DS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38966241,resource pulses are ecologically important phenomenon that occur in most ecosystems globally. many consumers switch to pulsatile foods when available. but how much individual variation there is in response to pulses is not well understood.
Timing of onset of menses after GnRH agonist treatment for central precocious puberty.,"To understand possible predictors of the onset of menses after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment cessation in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP). This exploratory post hoc analysis of a phase 3 and 4 trial of girls with CPP treated with once-monthly intramuscular leuprolide acetate examined onset of menses after treatment completion using a time-to-event analysis. Pretreatment and end-of-treatment chronologic age (CA), bone age (BA)/CA ratio, and Tanner breast stage; pretreatment menses status; and end-of-treatment BA and body mass index (BMI) were studied as potential factors influencing the onset of menses. Median time to first menses after stopping treatment was 18.3 months among 35 girls (mean age at onset of treatment, 6.8 years) examined. Of 26 girls experiencing menses, 11 (42 %) menstruated at 16-21 months after stopping treatment. Most girls with pretreatment BA/CA≥1.4 started menstruating very close to 18 months after stopping treatment; those with less advanced BA/CA experienced menses at 9-18 months. End-of-treatment BA/CA≥1.2 was associated with a quicker onset of menses (14.5 vs. 18.5 months for BA/CA<1.2, p=0.006). End-of-treatment BA≥12 years predicted longer time to menses. No relationship with time to menses was observed for pretreatment menarche status, pretreatment or end-of-treatment Tanner breast stage (<3/≥3) or CA (<6/≥6 or ≤11/>11), or end-of-treatment BMI percentiles (<85.6/≥85.6 and <92.6/≥92.6). Pretreatment menarche status or CA do not appear to predict onset of menses, but pre- and end-of-treatment BA/CA may be helpful in anticipating time to first menses after stopping treatment.",['Klein KO; Vargas Trujillo M; Dragnic S; Van Komen S; Li M; Lee PA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618862,"onset of menses after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment cessation in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP). pretreatment and end-of-treatment chronologic age (CA), bone age (BA)/CA ratio, and Tanner breast stage were examined."
"Histological, immunohistochemical and serological investigations of the ovary during follicular phase of estrous cycle in Saidi sheep.","Saidi sheep are the most abundant ruminant livestock species in Upper Egypt, especially in the Assiut governorate. Sheep are one of the most abundant animals raised for food in Egypt. They can convert low-quality roughages into meat and milk in addition to producing fiber and hides therefore; great opportunity exists to enhance their reproduction. Saidi breed is poorly known in terms of reproduction. So this work was done to give more information on some hormonal, oxidative, and blood metabolites parameters in addition to histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical investigations of the ovary during follicular phase of estrous cycle. The present study was conducted on 25 healthy Saidi ewes for serum analysis and 10 healthy ewes for histological assessment aged 2 to 5 years and weighted (38.5 ± 2.03 kg). The follicular phase of estrous cycle in Saidi sheep was characterized by the presence of ovarian follicles in different stages of development and atresia in addition to regressed corpus luteum. Interestingly, apoptosis and tissue oxidative markers play a crucial role in follicular and corpus luteum regression. The most prominent features of the follicular phase were the presence of mature antral (Graafian) and preovulatory follicles as well as increased level of some blood metabolites and oxidative markers. Here we give a new schematic sequence of ovarian follicles in Saidi sheep and describing the features of different types. We also clarified that these histological pictures of the ovary was influenced by hormonal, oxidative and blood metabolites factors that characterizes the follicular phase of estrous cycle in Saidi sheep. This work helps to understanding the reproduction in Saidi sheep which assist in improving the reproductive outcome of this breed of sheep. These findings are increasingly important for implementation of a genetic improvement program and utilizing the advanced reproductive techniques as estrous synchronization, artificial insemination and embryo transfer.",['Abd-Elkareem M; Khormi MA; Mohamed RH; Ali F; Hassan MS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461282,follicular phase of estrous cycle in Saidi sheep was characterized by the presence of ovarian follicles in different stages of development and atresia. apoptosis and tissue oxidative markers play a crucial role in follicular and corpus luteum regression.
Female sexual functioning during pregnancy.,"Sexuality is a fundamental, biological function of every human body, regardless of age, gender or race. However, the need for intimacy, closeness and sexual activity changes over time; it is influenced by the age, experience, physical and health condition. Sex is also one of the most important domains of the quality of life (QoL). However, this topic is still uneasy and rarely discussed, even though female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a common problem, which affects 20% to 50% of women. Moreover, women experience processes that do not affect men, such as menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. In this review we focused on pregnancy, since sexual life of pregnant women alters during pregnancy due to the physiological, anatomical and hormonal changes in her body. Nonetheless, woman can keep having sex during a physiological pregnancy, but this issue is rarely addressed by physicians-gynecologists. Therefore, the aim of this manuscript was to discuss female sexuality during pregnancy.",['Szymanska E; Kisielewski R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37842988,"sexuality is a fundamental, biological function of every human body. but the need for intimacy, closeness and sexual activity changes over time. this topic is still uneasy and rarely discussed."
Effects of biological sex and oral contraception on the sympathetic neurocirculatory adjustments to static handgrip exercise in humans.,"While biological sex affects the neurocirculatory adjustments to exercise, the effects of sex hormones on sympathetic action potential (AP) patterns and ensuing vascular transduction remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that males, and females using oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), would demonstrate larger increases in sympathetic activation and sympathetic vascular transduction compared with naturally menstruating females during static handgrip exercise (SHG) and postexercise circulatory occlusion (PECO). Young males [<i>n</i> = 14, 25 (5) yr], females using OCPs [<i>n</i> = 16, 24 (6) yr], and naturally menstruating females [<i>n</i> = 18, 26 (4) yr] underwent assessments of multiunit muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)/AP discharge patterns (microneurography) and femoral artery blood flow (ultrasound) during fatiguing SHG at 40% maximum voluntary contraction and 2-min PECO. Sympathetic vascular transduction was determined as the quotient of the change in leg vascular conductance (LVC) and MSNA/AP discharge. Males demonstrated greater increases in APs/burst [males: Δ7 (6) vs. midluteal: Δ2 (3), <i>P</i> = 0.028] and total AP clusters [males: Δ5 (3) vs. midluteal: Δ2 (3), <i>P</i> = 0.008] compared with naturally menstruating females only but not those using OCPs during exercise (APs/burst: <i>P</i> = 0.171, total clusters: <i>P</i> = 0.455). Sympathetic vascular transduction of MSNA burst amplitude, APs/burst, and total AP clusters was greater in males and females using OCPs compared with naturally menstruating females (range: <i>P</i> = 0.004-0.044). In contrast, during PECO no group differences were observed in AP discharge (range: <i>P</i> = 0.510-0.872), and AP discharge was not related to LVC during PECO (range: <i>P</i> = 0.08-0.949). These data indicate that biological sex and OCP use impact the central generation of AP discharge, as well as the transduction of these neuronal messages into peripheral vasoconstriction during static exercise.","[""D'Souza AW; Hissen SL; Manabe K; Washio T; Annis MC; Sanchez B; Fu Q; Shoemaker JK""]",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37694305,males and females using oral contraceptive pills showed increased APs/burst. males showed greater increases in sympathetic activation and sympathetic vascular transduction. males showed greater increases in APs/burst [males].

Data was presented using tables, and analyzed using percentages, frequencies, medians, interquartile range, means and standard deviations, t-test and ANOVA were used to establish statistical significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the participants, 275 were included in the data analysis. The median age of the participants was 21 years with range of 18-39 years and interquartile range of 20-24 years. All the participants had attained menarche. Of the participants, 97.8% (95%CI: 95.2-99.0) (269/275) reported some form of menstrual disorder. Premenstrual symptoms were the commonest disorder (93.8% (95%CI: 90.2-96.1), N = 258) followed by dysmenorrhea (63.6% (95% CI: 57.7-69.1), N = 175), irregular menstruation (20.7% (95%CI: 16.3-25.9), N = 57), frequent menstruation (7.3% 95% CI:4.7-11.0, N = 20) and infrequent menstruation (3.3% (95% CI:1.7-6.2), N = 9). Dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms significantly reduced the QOL scores of participants. Menstrual disorders were highly prevalent with negative effects on QOL and class attendance. Efforts should be made to screen and possibly treat menstrual disorders among university students as well as to conduct further studies to elucidate more on the effects of menstrual disorders on quality of life.",['Odongo E; Byamugisha J; Ajeani J; Mukisa J'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36997915,menstrual problems affect as high as 90% of adolescent females. menstrual problems affect as high as 90% of adolescent females.
Female-Specific Health Care of Military Female-Designated Service Members and Veterans: A Systematic Overview of Reviews.,"Since the War in Afghanistan began in 2001, service members have faced significant health effects related to service during war, with female-designated service members facing unique challenges. Numerous high-quality review articles have been published on the health and care of female-designated service members and veterans. Given the increasing volume of literature, we completed an overview of reviews on the health and health care of female-designated military populations. Our objective was to conduct an overview of reviews on the obstetrics and gynecologic health and health care of female-designated military populations since 2000 to understand female-specific health consequences of military service during war and make clinical recommendations. On May 10, 2022, a medical librarian performed a comprehensive search across five databases (Ovid Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Ovid All EBM Reviews, and Web of Science) for all relevant reviews published from 2000 to May 10, 2022. Results were limited to English language. After the removal of duplicates, 2,438 records were reviewed, and 69 studies were included in the final review. The search strategy and methods were registered with PROSPERO and are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) guidelines. Two independent reviewers conducted title and abstract screening and subsequent full text review using Covidence Systematic Review Software. Reviews addressing female-specific and obstetrics and gynecologic health of female-designated service members or veterans, utilizing a clear and systematic methodology, were eligible for inclusion. Quality assessment was conducted by teams of two reviewers. A total of 69 studies were included in the final review. Themes included mental health and impact of sexual assault on service members or veterans, veteran health care, issues of menstruation, pregnancy, and urogenital concerns. Areas with few reviews included occupational risks of military service and impact on obstetric outcomes, eating disorders, and menopause. There were insufficient or no reviews on the impact of military service on fertility, access to abortion care, reproductive health outcomes of lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members, surgical treatment of gynecologic conditions, and screening and treatment for breast, gynecologic, and non-pelvic organ cancers. Female-designated military populations serving during periods of war face unique health challenges that should be considered in screening practices and the delivery of trauma informed care. Further research and reviews are needed for female-specific oncology, fertility, abortion access, and sexual and non-binary and expansive gender identities to better capture female-designated service member and veteran health during wartime and beyond.",['McDermott MC; Musilli MG; Brown JE; Melton JL; Miller MJ; Allard RJ; Lutgendorf MA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38537156,"a medical librarian performed a comprehensive search across five databases. 2,438 records were reviewed, and 69 studies were included in the final review."
Corals that survive repeated thermal stress show signs of selection and acclimatization.,"Climate change is transforming coral reefs by increasing the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves, often leading to coral bleaching and mortality. Coral communities have demonstrated modest increases in thermal tolerance following repeated exposure to moderate heat stress, but it is unclear whether these shifts represent acclimatization of individual colonies or mortality of thermally susceptible individuals. For corals that survive repeated bleaching events, it is important to understand how past bleaching responses impact future growth potential. Here, we track the bleaching responses of 1,832 corals in leeward Maui through multiple marine heatwaves and document patterns of coral growth and survivorship over a seven-year period. While we find limited evidence of acclimatization at population scales, we document reduced bleaching over time in specific individuals that is indicative of acclimatization, primarily in the stress-tolerant taxa Porites lobata. For corals that survived both bleaching events, we find no relationship between bleaching response and coral growth in three of four taxa studied. This decoupling suggests that coral survivorship is a better indicator of future growth than is a coral's bleaching history. Based on these results, we recommend restoration practitioners in Hawai'i focus on colonies of Porites and Montipora with a proven track-record of growth and survivorship, rather than devote resources toward identifying and cultivating bleaching-resistant phenotypes in the lab. Survivorship followed a latitudinal thermal stress gradient, but because this gradient was small, it is likely that local environmental factors also drove differences in coral performance between sites. Efforts to reduce human impacts at low performing sites would likely improve coral survivorship in the future.",['McCarthy OS; Winston Pomeroy M; Smith JE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39083457,corals that survive repeated thermal stress show signs of selection and acclimatization. corals that survive repeated thermal stress show signs of selection and acclimatization. corals that survive repeated thermal stress show signs of selection and acclimatization.
Prevalence and Associated Factors of Premenstrual Syndrome in Chinese Adolescent Girls.,"Epidemiological data on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in Chinese adolescents are limited. This study reported the prevalence and associated factors of PMS in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. A total of 5099 adolescent girls who had menarche participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort study in Shandong, China. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ask about PMS, age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, menstrual regularity, period pain, body weight and height, trait anger, stressful life events, and demographics. The mean age of the sample was 15.19 years (SD = 1.32). The overall prevalence of PMS was 24.6%. The prevalence rates of PMS-anxiety, PMS-water retention, PMS-craving, and PMS-depression were 18.9%, 4.0%, 7.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. The most common symptoms were premenstrual irritability (54%) and fatigue (52.5%). Stepwise logistic regression showed that high levels of life stress (OR 2.26), high levels of trait anger (OR 4.65), alcohol consumption (OR 1.28), menstrual cycle interval ≤ 24 days (OR 1.45), and mild (OR 1.50), moderate (OR 2.57) or severe period pain (OR 4.84) were all significantly associated with increased likelihood of PMS. In conclusion, approximately 1 in 4 Chinese adolescent girls suffered from PMS. Multiple psychosocial and menstrual factors were associated with PMS. Further research is needed to understand developmental changes of PMS and its long-term impacts on psychosocial wellbeing in Chinese adolescent girls.",['Liu X; Liu ZZ; Yang Y; Jia CX'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37964097,"a total of 5099 adolescent girls who had menarche participated in the baseline survey of Shandong, china. a self-administered questionnaire was used to ask about PMS, age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, menstrual regularity, period pain, body weight and height, trait anger, stressful life events."

Study to Determine the Prevalence of Menstrual Migraine in Reproductive-Age Women in Saudi Arabia.,"Migraine is a common health condition in both men and women. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects many women during their menstrual cycle, with around 50-60% of women with migraine attacks experiencing menstrual headaches. Most have mild symptoms, but 5-8% suffer from moderate to severe symptoms, causing distress and functional issues. Pure menstrual migraine (PMM) occurs in about 50% of women with migraine, and it can be debilitating in terms of frequency and severity. This information is crucial for Saudi Arabian medical professionals to provide better care and support, improving the quality of life for women with PMS and menstrual migraine (MM) attacks. To estimate the prevalence of MM in women, to evaluate the severity and frequency of MM in women with PMS, and to identify potential risk factors aggravating MM in women with PMS in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted on reproductive-aged (18-50 years) women who had regular menstrual cycles and were diagnosed with PMS, using a self-administered questionnaire between December 2022 to May 2023 in Saudi Arabia. Out of the 2130 female participants, 397 (18.6%) had migraine. Among these 397 migraine sufferers, 230 (57.9%) experienced MM, while 167 (42.1%) had non-MM. In reproductive women in general, MM occurred in 10.7% of cases, while non-MM was observed in 7.8%. There is a correlation between increasing BMI and an increased incidence of MM. About one-third of the participants experienced moderate disability due to migraine attacks, with 134 (33.8%) individuals affected. Additionally, most MM sufferers missed at least 3 days of work in the last 3 months due to their condition. Migraine attacks occurring during the menstrual cycle impair the ability to engage in social, physical, household, and academic activities, often hindering the fulfillment of professional commitments. To gain a deeper understanding of menstrual and non-menstrual migraine attacks, it is essential to conduct extensive prospective studies aimed at developing effective management strategies.",['Al-Qahtani Z; Narapureddy BR; Reddy LKV; Asiri HYM; Alsulami AAH; Hassan NKA; Shawkhan RA; Hamood NA; Almahdi HAM; Al Qasim YY; Al Majbar YAM; Swadi AAA; Asiri AHH; Almaker BAA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38338202,study to determine the prevalence of menstrual migraine in women with migraine.

Chlamydia trachomatis Seroassays Used in Epidemiologic Research: A Narrative Review and Practical Considerations.,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to adverse reproductive health outcomes. CT prevalence estimates are primarily derived from screening using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). However, screening guidelines in the United States only include particular subpopulations, and NAATs only detect current infections. In contrast, seroassays identify past CT infections, which is important for understanding the public health impacts of CT, including pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility. Older seroassays have been plagued by low sensitivity and specificity and have not been validated using a consistent reference measure, making it challenging to compare studies, define the epidemiology of CT, and determine the effectiveness of control programs. Newer seroassays have better performance characteristics. This narrative review summarizes the ""state of the science"" for CT seroassays that have been applied in epidemiologic studies and provides practical considerations for interpreting the literature and employing seroassays in future research.",['Waters MB; Hybiske K; Ikeda R; Kaltenboeck B; Manhart LE; Kreisel KM; Khosropour CM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052727,"a narrative review of the'state of the science' for CT seroassays. the narrative review summarizes the ""state of the science"" for CT seroassays. seroassays are used in epidemiologic studies."
Bilateral Oophorectomy Prevalence Among U.S. Women.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Bilateral oophorectomy has been linked to numerous health outcomes, some of which can have a long latency period. Limited data are available on bilateral oophorectomy prevalence among U.S. women. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The National Health Interview Survey fielded measures of bilateral oophorectomy most recently in 2010 and 2015. We pooled these 2 data years to present bilateral oophorectomy prevalence estimates by age-group, race, ethnicity, geographic region, and hysterectomy status. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Our study found bilateral oophorectomy was common among older women. Among women aged 70-79 years, 29% reported a bilateral oophorectomy, compared with <1% for women aged 20-29 years. By geographic region, bilateral oophorectomy prevalence among women 20-84 years was 12.3% in the South, 10.8% in the Midwest, 9.4% in the West, and 8.0% in the Northeast. Small numbers limited our ability to generate age-specific estimates for American Indian and Alaska Native women and subgroups of Asian and Hispanic women. Nearly half of women who had a bilateral oophorectomy reported their procedure occurred more than 20 years ago. Among women aged 20-84 years who reported a hysterectomy, 57% reported they also had both of their ovaries removed. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Standard measures of incidence rates for ovarian cancer are not adjusted for oophorectomy status. These findings suggest that ovarian cancer incidence rates may be underestimated among older women. Continued monitoring of bilateral oophorectomy prevalence will be needed to track its potential impact on ovarian cancer incidence and numerous other chronic health outcomes.",['Adam EE; White MC; Townsend JS; Stewart SL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39011627,bilateral oophorectomy prevalence among women in the united states is common among older women. a study found bilateral oophorectomy was common among older women.
Laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age.,"This is an updated version of the original review, published in Issue 1, 2011, of The Cochrane Library. Acute lower abdominal pain is common, and making a diagnosis is particularly challenging in premenopausal women, as ovulation and menstruation symptoms overlap with symptoms of appendicitis, early pregnancy complications and pelvic infection. A management strategy involving early laparoscopy could potentially provide a more accurate diagnosis, earlier treatment and reduced risk of complications. To evaluate the effectiveness and harms of laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age. The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS and CINAHL were searched (October 2013). The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched. No new studies were included in this updated version. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included women of childbearing age who presented with acute lower abdominal pain, non-specific lower abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis were included. Trials were included if they evaluated laparoscopy with open appendicectomy, or laparoscopy with a wait and see strategy. Study selection was carried out by two review authors independently. Data from studies that met the inclusion criteria were independently extracted by two review authors and the risk of bias assessed. We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. A summary of findings table was prepared using GRADE criteria. A total of 12 studies including 1020 participants were incorporated into the review. These studies had low to moderate risk of bias, mainly because allocation concealment or methods of sequence generation were not adequately reported. In addition, it was not clear whether follow-up was similar for the treatment groups. The index test was incorporated as a reference standard in the laparoscopy group, and differential verification or partial verification bias may have occurred in most RCTs. Overall the quality of the evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach.Laparoscopy was compared with open appendicectomy in eight RCTs. Laparoscopy was associated with an increased rate of specific diagnoses (seven RCTs, 561 participants; odds ratio (OR) 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50 to 6.71; I(2) = 18%), but no evidence was found of reduced rates for any adverse events (eight RCTs, 623 participants; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.10; I(2) = 0%). A meta-analysis of seven studies found a significant difference favouring the laparoscopic procedure in the rate of removal of normal appendix (seven RCTs, 475 participants; OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I(2) = 0%).Laparoscopic diagnosis versus a 'wait and see' strategy was investigated in four RCTs. A significant difference favoured laparoscopy in terms of rate of specific diagnoses (four RCTs, 395 participants; OR 6.07, 95% CI 1.85 to 29.88; I(2) = 79%), but no evidence suggested a difference in rates of adverse events (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.67; I(2) = 0%).   We found that laparoscopy in women with acute lower abdominal pain, non-specific lower abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis led to a higher rate of specific diagnoses being made and a lower rate of removal of normal appendices compared with open appendicectomy only. Hospital stays were shorter. No evidence showed an increase in adverse events when any of these strategies were used.",['Gaitán HG; Reveiz L; Farquhar C; Elias VM'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24848893,"laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age was updated. the review was published in Issue 1, 2011 of The Cochrane Library."
Seasonal shifts in insect ephemerality drive bat foraging effort.,"Animal foraging is fundamentally shaped by food distribution and availability.<sup>1</sup> However, the quantification of spatiotemporal food distribution is rare<sup>2</sup> but crucial to explain variation in foraging behavior among species, populations, or individuals. Clumped but ephemeral food sources enable rapid energy intake but require increased effort to find,<sup>3</sup> can generate variable foraging success,<sup>4</sup> and force animals to forage more efficiently. We quantified seasonal shifts in the availability of such resources to test the proximate effects of food distribution on changes in movement patterns. The neotropical lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) forages in a seasonal environment on emerging aquatic insects, whose numbers peak shortly after dusk.<sup>5</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup> We GPS-tracked bats and quantified nocturnal insect distribution in their foraging area using floating camera traps across wet and dry seasons. Surprisingly, insects were 75% less abundant and swarms were 60% shorter lived (more ephemeral) in the wet season. As a result, wet season bats had to fly twice as far (total and maximum distance fromroost distances) and 45% longer (duration) per night. Within foraging bouts, wet season bats spent less time in each insect patch and searched longer for subsequent patches, reflecting increased temporal ephemerality and decreased spatial predictability of insects. Our results highlight the tight link between foraging effort and spatiotemporal distribution of food and the influence of constraints imposed by reproduction on behavioral flexibility and adaptations to the highly dynamic resource landscapes of mobile prey.<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>8</sup> Examining foraging behavior in light of spatiotemporal dynamics of resources can help predict how animals respond to shifts in food availability caused by escalating environmental changes.",['Kohles JE; Page RA; Wikelski M; Dechmann DKN'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38942018,neotropical lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) forages in a seasonal environment on emerging aquatic insects. we quantified nocturnal insect distribution in their foraging area using floating camera traps across wet and dry seasons.
Limited Impacts of Water Diversion on Micro-eukaryotic Community along the Eastern Route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project.,"The Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (ER-SNWDP) represents a crucial initiative aimed at alleviating water scarcity in China's northern region. Understanding the dynamics governing the composition and assembly processes of micro-eukaryotic communities within the canal during different water diversion periods holds paramount significance for the effective management of the ER-SNWDP. Our study systematically tracks the dynamics of the micro-eukaryotic community and its assembly processes along the 1045.4 km of canals and four impounded lakes, totaling 3455 km<sup>2</sup>, constituting the ER-SNWDP during a complete water diversion cycle, utilizing high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics tools, and null modeling algorithms. The primary objectives of this study are to elucidate the spatial-temporal succession of micro-eukaryotic communities as the water diversion progresses, to delineate the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly, and to identify the pivotal factors driving changes in micro-eukaryotic communities. Our findings indicate notable variations in the composition and diversity of micro-eukaryotic communities within the ER-SNWDP across different water diversion periods and geographic locations (P < 0.05). This variation is influenced by a confluence of temporal and environmental factors, with limited impacts from water diversion. In essence, the assembly of micro-eukaryotic communities within the ER-SNWDP primarily stemmed from heterogeneous selection driven by deterministic processes. Water diversion exhibited a tendency to decrease community beta diversity while augmenting the influence of stochastic processes in community assembly, albeit this effect attenuated over time. Furthermore, our analysis identified several pivotal environmental parameters, notably including nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate, and water temperature, as exerting significant effects on micro-eukaryotic communities across different water diversion periods. Collectively, our study furnishes the inaugural comprehensive exploration of the dynamics, assembly processes, and influencing factors governing micro-eukaryotic communities within the ER-SNWDP, thus furnishing indispensable insights to inform the water quality management of this important project.",['Wei J; Zhang Q; Yin Y; Peng K; Wang L; Cai Y; Gong Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096537,the eastern route of the south-to-North Water Diversion Project is a crucial initiative aimed at alleviating water scarcity in china's northern region. understanding the dynamics governing the composition and assembly processes of micro-eukaryotic communities within the canal during different water diversion periods holds paramount significance.
"Chromosomal polymorphisms and susceptibility to menstrual disorders: a retrospective analysis of 24,578 women.","To evaluate the association between the polymorphic variants of chromosomes and menstrual disorders. The data from our previous retrospective, single-center cohort study were re-analyzed. Women with regular menstruation were included as controls. Women with menstrual cycle abnormalities were subgrouped according to reproductive causes. The frequency of chromosomal polymorphisms was compared between groups. Regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounding variables. A total of 24,578 women composed of 8062 women with regular cycles as the control group and 16,516 women as the menstrual cycle irregularity group were included. When compared with the control group, the incidence of chromosomal polymorphisms in the total menstrual cycle irregularity group, Polycystic ovary syndrome group, and Primary ovarian insufficiency group were significantly higher (4.49% versus 5.34%, P = 0.004, 4.49% versus 5.35%, P = 0.018 and 4.49% versus 5.94%, P = 0.002, respectively). The incidences of inv(9) in the Primary ovarian insufficiency group were significantly higher than that in the control individuals (1.0% versus 1.6%, P = 0.024). Logistic regression analysis showed an effect of chromosomal polymorphisms on menstrual cycle irregularity (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.234-2.187, P = 0.007; adjusted OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.153-1.819, P < 0.001).

Changing Glucose Levels During the Menstrual Cycle as Observed in Adults in the Type 1 Diabetes Exercise Initiative Study.,"Evidence suggests that glucose levels in menstruating females with type 1 diabetes change throughout the menstrual cycle, reaching a peak during the luteal phase. The Type 1 Diabetes Exercise Initiative (T1DEXI) study provided the opportunity to assess glycemic metrics between early and late phases of the menstrual cycle, and whether differences could be explained by exercise, insulin, and carbohydrate intake. One hundred seventy-nine women were included in our analysis. Glycemic metrics, carbohydrate intake, insulin requirements, and exercise habits during the early vs late phases of their menstrual cycles (i.e. 2 to 4 days after vs 2 to 4 days before reported menstruation start date) were compared. Mean glucose increased from 8.2±1.5 mmol/L (148±27 mg/dL) during the early follicular phase to 8.6±1.6 mmol/L (155±29 mg/dL) during the late luteal phase (p<0.001). Mean percent time-in-range (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L [70 to 180 mg/dL]) decreased from 73±17% to 70±18% (p=0.002), and median percent time >10.0 mmol/L (>180 mg/dL) increased from 21% to 23% (p<0.001). Median total daily insulin requirements increased from 37.4 units during the early follicular phase to 38.5 units during the late luteal phase (p=0.02) and mean daily carbohydrate consumption increased slightly from 127±47 g to 133±47 g (p=0.05); however, the difference in mean glucose during early follicular vs late luteal phase was not explained by differences in exercise duration, total daily insulin units, or reported carbohydrate intake. Glucose levels during the late luteal phase were higher than those of the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. These glycemic changes suggest that glucose management for women with type 1 diabetes may need to be fine-tuned within the context of their menstrual cycles.",['Li Z; Yardley JE; Zaharieva DP; Riddell MC; Gal RL; Calhoun P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38972477,"glycemic metrics, carbohydrate intake, insulin requirements, and exercise habits during the early and late phases of the menstrual cycle were compared. glycemic metrics, carbohydrate intake, insulin requirements, and exercise habits during the early and late phases of their menstrual cycles were compared."
Sex differences in sensory processing in children with autism spectrum disorder.,"Despite the high prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), little research has focused on the sex differences in sensory processing. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge on the female-specific symptoms of ASD, contributing to later referral, diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we examined the sex differences in sensory processing symptoms in large cohorts of ASD children (N = 168; 26 females, 142 males) and typically developing (TD) children (N = 439; 209 females, 230 males). For this, we translated the sensory processing measure (SPM) and SPM - Preschool (SPM-P) Home Forms to French. The SPM/SPM-P are parent/caregiver questionnaires that assess typical behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. Overall, our results showed that the magnitude of the differences in sensory processing between males and females is larger in ASD children relative to TD children, with females showing more severe symptoms in Hearing, as well as Balance and Motion subscales. Additionally, linear discriminant analysis showed that the SPM/SPM-P are good at discriminating TD children from ASD, children with higher accuracy rates for females than for males. These findings are discussed in light of the heterogeneity of sensory processing difficulties present in ASD. Overall, our results suggest that there seem to be female-specific profiles in sensory processing difficulties in ASD. Implications of findings concerning sex differences in sensory processing and their potential for improving identification and diagnosis of ASD females are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: The present study examined sex differences in behavioral responses to sensory stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing (TD) children. While there is a small trend for TD males to show more sensory processing atypicalities, female ASD children show significantly more atypical responses compared to their male counterparts. This has important implications for characterizing female autism profiles, and ultimately improving the chance for earlier detection, diagnosis and treatment.",['Osório JMA; Rodríguez-Herreros B; Richetin S; Junod V; Romascano D; Pittet V; Chabane N; Jequier Gygax M; Maillard AM'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34288517,"despite the high prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), little research has focused on the sex differences in sensory processing. there is a lack of knowledge on the female-specific symptoms of ASD, contributing to later referral, diagnosis and intervention."
The Influence of Menstrual Cycle Phases on Maximal Strength Performance in Healthy Female Adults: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.,"Maximal strength is a significant factor in achieving peak performance and injury prevention in athletes. In individualization strategies for the efficient development of athletes, it is necessary to consider the respective components separately. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the effects of the different cycle phases on isometric, isokinetic, and dynamic maximum strength. A systematic literature review was conducted; databases were searched from January 1960 to September 2023. The included studies focused on the expression of maximal strength in the earlier follicular phase as well as at least one comparative phase. Of the initial 707 articles identified, 22 met the selection criteria and were included. The studies considered a total of 433 subjects. Our results revealed medium effects (weighted mean standardized mean difference (<i>SMD</i>) = 0.60; seven studies) for isometric maximal strength in favor of the late follicular phase, small effects (weighted mean <i>SMD</i> = 0.39; five studies) for isokinetic maximal strength in favor of the ovulation phase, and small effects (weighted mean <i>SMD</i> = 0.14; three studies) for dynamic maximal strength in favor of the late follicular phase. The results indicate that the early follicular phase is unfavorable for all strength classes. Peak performance in isometric strength is seen in the late follicular phase, whereas isokinetic strength peaks during ovulation. Dynamic strength is optimal in the late follicular phase.",['Niering M; Wolf-Belala N; Seifert J; Tovar O; Coldewey J; Kuranda J; Muehlbauer T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38251305,"the study examined the effects of the different cycle phases on isometric, isokinetic, and dynamic maximum strength. the results indicate that the early follicular phase is unfavorable for all strength classes."
Beyond Birth Control: Noncontraceptive Benefits of Hormonal Methods and Their Key Role in the General Medical Care of Women.,"Contraceptives that contain estrogen and/or progestins are used by millions of women around the world to prevent pregnancy. Owing to their unique physiological mechanism of action, many of these medications can also be used to prevent cancer and treat multiple general medical conditions that are common in women. We performed a comprehensive literature search. This article will describe the specific mechanisms of action and summarize the available data documenting how hormonal contraceptives can prevent ovarian and uterine cancer and be used to treat women with a variety of gynecological and nongynecological conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, heavy menstrual bleeding, polycystic ovary syndrome, acne, and migraines. Contraceptive methods containing estrogen and progestin can be used for a wide variety of medical issues in women.",['Schrager S; Larson M; Carlson J; Ledford K; Ehrenthal DB'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155101,hormonal contraceptives contain estrogen and/or progestins. they are used by millions of women around the world to prevent pregnancy. hormonal contraceptives can also prevent ovarian and uterine cancer.
Crosstalk between Extracellular Matrix Stiffness and ROS Drives Endometrial Repair via the HIF-1α/YAP Axis during Menstruation.,"Although the menstrual cycle driven by sex steroid hormones is an uncomplicated physiological process, it is important for female health, fertility and regenerative biology. However, our understanding of this unique type of tissue homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we examined the biological effects of mechanical force by evaluating the changing trend of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, and the results suggested that ECM stiffness was reduced and that breaking of mechanotransduction delayed endometrium repair in a mouse model of simulated menses. We constructed an ECM stiffness interference model in vitro to explain the mechanical force conduction mechanism during endometrial regeneration. We discovered that ECM stiffness increased the expression and nuclear transfer of YAP, which improved the creation of a microenvironment, in a manner that induced proliferation and angiogenesis for endometrial repair by activating YAP. In addition, we observed that physiological endometrial hypoxia occurs during the menstrual cycle and that the expression of HIF-1α was increased. Mechanistically, in addition to the classical F-actin/YAP pathway, we also found that the ROS/HIF-1α/YAP axis was involved in the transmission of mechanical signals. This study provides novel insights into the essential menstrual cycle and presents an effective, nonhormonal treatment for menstrual disorders.",['Zhang T; Wang Y; Wang Y; Liu C; Han C'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36231126,"crosstalk between extracellular matrix Stiffness and ROS drives endometrial repair via the HIF-1/YAP Axis during menstruation. the study provides novel insights into the essential menstrual cycle and presents an effective, nonhormonal treatment for menstrual disorders."
Serotonin 4 receptor brain binding and oxytocin-promoted affective and social cognition in healthy women - A randomized controlled trial.,"Oxytocin is a neuropeptide known for its prosocial properties and role in social bonding, and intervention with intranasal oxytocin is posited to modulate affective and social cognition (i.e., hot cognition). Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is also involved in emotional and social behaviors and appear to work in concert with oxytocin. However, this interaction so far remains elusive in humans. Therefore, we here investigate the relation between brain 5-HT 4 receptor (5-HT<sub>4</sub>R) levels and oxytocin-modulated hot cognition. Using a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, 35 healthy women received a dose of 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo one month apart. The women were naturally cycling and to control for hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle, intervention days were placed during the early follicular phase. Following intervention cognitive domains including affective memory, affective bias in emotion processing, moral emotions and social information preference were assessed. In a subgroup (n = 25), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was used to image 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R brain binding at baseline with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SB207145 radiotracer. No effect of oxytocin intervention relative to placebo was observed for any of the cognitive outcomes. Likewise, regional brain 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding at baseline was not associated with cognitive responses to oxytocin intervention. Our data suggest that intervention with intranasal oxytocin does not have an overall effect on hot cognition in healthy women and further that 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R brain architecture does not mediate cognitive effects of oxytocin in the healthy state.",['Dam VH; Andersen SH; Pedersen ST; Stenbæk DS; Frokjaer VG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38288372,"a placebo-controlled trial was performed in 35 healthy women. the trial was randomized controlled and compared with placebo. the trial was performed using a double blind, placebo-controlled design."
Prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome in Indian adolescents.,"PCOS is a common female endocrine disorder with prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 26%. Most reports have studied adult women with age ranged from 18 to 45 years. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents. We prospectively studied 460 girls aged 15 to 18 years from a residential college in Andhra Pradesh, South India, who underwent clinical examination. Out of which 72 girls with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism were invited for biochemical, hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluation for diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria. PCOS was defined as the presence of any two of the three features: (1) Oligo/amenorrhea: absence of menstruation for 45 days or more and/or ≤8 menses per year. (2) Clinical hyperandrogenism: Modified Ferriman and Gallway (mFG) score of 6 or higher. (3) Polycystic ovaries: presence of >10 cysts, 2-8 mm in diameter, usually combined with increased ovarian volume of >10 cm(3), and an echo-dense stroma in pelvic ultrasound scan. Out of 460 girls, one (0.22%) had oligo/amenorrhea with clinical hyperandrogenism, 29 (6.30%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries, one (0.22%) had polycystic ovaries with clinical hyperandrogenism and 11 (2.39%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries in the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism. Thus 42 (9.13%) girls satisfied Rotterdam's criteria for PCOS, which increased to 50.46 (10.97%) when imputed data were included. Prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents is 9.13%.This draws attention to the issue of early diagnosis in adolescent girls.",['Nidhi R; Padmalatha V; Nagarathna R; Amritanshu R'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21600812,PCOS is a common female endocrine disorder with prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 26%. most reports have studied adult women with age ranged from 18 to 45 years.
[Catamenial pneumothorax: a rare spontaneous pneumothorax associated with the menstrual cycle].,"Catamenial pneumothorax is a rare clinical condition that may be difficult to diagnose. Catamenial pneumothorax is defined as spontaneous pneumothorax that occurs within 72 hours before or after the onset of menstruation. It occurs in the right lung in 91.7% of cases. However, the exact pathogenic mechanism and optimal management of catamenial pneumothorax remain unclear. Patients may suffer extensive psychological stress during prolonged diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and follow-up. This article discusses common issues related to catamenial pneumothorax pathogenic mechanisms, symptoms, diagnostic and optimal management, health problems, and nursing care, and provides the opinions of nursing staff with actual case experience.",['Chuang TY; Chung YC; Yeh ML'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22024812,catamenial pneumothorax is defined as spontaneous pneumothorax. it occurs within 72 hours before or after the onset of menstruation. it occurs in the right lung in 91.7% of cases.
Factors affecting the quality of life in pregnant women with diabetes: the mediating effect of illnesses acceptance.,"Gestational diabetes, as a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, is considered one of the most common metabolic complications in pregnancy. The diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy leads to changes in lifestyle, and the treatments employed can affect various aspects of pregnant women's lives, including their quality of life. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between self-efficacy and the mediating effect of illness acceptance on the quality of life in pregnant women diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 240 pregnant women diagnosed with diabetes who were selected by convenience sampling method. Quality of life tools (SF12), the Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), and the Sherer self-efficacy scale were used to collect data. The mean (SD) of quality of life, self-efficacy, and disease acceptance were 57.36 (6.63), 51.75 (7.44), and 29.07 (7.69), respectively. In the single-variable regression analysis, self-efficacy and disease acceptance variables could predict 20.6% (β = 0.457, P < 0.001) and 14.4% (β = 0.385, P < 0.001) of the variations in quality of life, respectively. In the multiple regression model, by entering the two main variables (self-efficacy and Acceptance of Illness), demographic characteristics, three disease knowledge variables, health status from an individual perspective, and type of treatment, the variables could explain 25% of the changes of the quality of life (R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub> 0.25, P < 0.001=). Income status and self-efficacy had the highest impact among the variables. According to the results of path analysis, the total effect of self-efficacy on the quality of life of pregnant women with diabetes was 0.711. The overall quality of life in women with diabetes was moderate, and self-efficacy, illness acceptance, and income status were predictors of overall quality of life. Self-efficacy can influence the quality of life by affecting disease acceptance. The findings highlight the importance of designing educational programs and providing midwifery services to increase self-efficacy and illness acceptance to improve the quality of life of pregnant women with diabetes.",['Fathnezhad-Kazemi A; Seifinadergoli Z; Ahmadi M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075420,study aimed to investigate relationship between self-efficacy and illness acceptance. self-efficacy and disease acceptance variables could predict 20.6% and 14.4% of variations in quality of life.
Beneficial effects of pioglitazone and α-lipoic acid in patients with polycystic ovaries syndrome.,"Changes in hormone levels, improper lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress all significantly contribute to the pathogenic process of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). According to earlier research, pioglitazone and alpha-lipoic acid are crucial in the emergence of PCOS. The beneficial effects of pioglitazone and alpha-lipoic acid on PCOS were examined in the current study. The 120 patients with PCOS received three months of treatment in pioglitazone groups (n=40 case, 30 mg/time, 1 time/day), α-lipoic acid (n=40 case, 0.6 g/time, 1 time/day), and combination therapy (n=40 case, pioglitazone 30 mg/time, 1 time/day and α-lipoic acid, 0.6 g/time, 1 time/day). Before and after therapy, the following factors were evaluated: the hormonal profile, fasting serum insulin, body weight, body mass index (BMI), menstruation status, oxidative stress, and indications of lipid metabolism. The combination of pioglitazone and α-lipoic acid has a significantly improving effect on BMI, body weight, oxidative stress levels, lipid metabolism, and menstrual status. A significant increase in body weight, BMI, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were found in mice after being treated with α-lipoic acid alone. However, the use pioglitazone alone improves body weight, BMI, the calculation of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), Area under the curve (AUC)-insulin, fasting glucose/insulin (G/I) ratio, total testosterone, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in post-treatment than pre-treatment. These findings suggest that pioglitazone alone has a better effect than alpha-lipoic acid in improving oxidative stress levels, BMI, and menstrual cyclicity. Additionally, treatment with pioglitazone and alpha-lipoic acid did demonstrate a greater effect than monotherapy with each medication alone.",['Pei Y; Liu YY; Sun M; Zheng J; Zhou TT; Wang B; Hu H; Wang ZL'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606122,"the beneficial effects of pioglitazone and alpha-lipoic acid on PCOS were examined in the current study. the 120 patients with PCOS received three months of treatment in pioglitazone groups. changes in hormone levels, improper lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress all significantly contribute to the pathogenic process of polycystic ovarian syndrome."
Female Athlete Research Camp: A Unique Model for Conducting Research in High-Performance Female Athletes.,"The purpose of this study is to describe the implementation of a novel research protocol for conducting research with highly trained female athletes, including characterizing menstrual cycle (MC) function, hormonal profiles and symptoms of the participating athletes. Twenty-four Australian First Nation female Rugby League athletes completed this study, which involved 11 wk of cycle tracking, followed by attendance at a 5-wk training camp. Throughout the study, athletes completed a daily survey, reporting their MC function and any associated symptoms. During the training camp, athletes reported to the laboratory on three occasions and provided a venous blood sample, which was analyzed for reproductive hormones. For naturally cycling athletes (athleteNC, n = 11), this included phase 1, 2, and 4 of the menstrual cycle, whereas athletes using hormonal contraception (athleteHC; n = 13) were tested at three equally spaced time points in which consistent exogenous hormone provision occurred. In the athleteNC cohort, just one athlete reached criteria for classification as eumenorrheic, with five athletes showing evidence of MC dysfunction. The prevalence of symptoms on any given day was similar between athleteNC (33.7%) and athleteHC (22.9%; P = 0.376); however, more symptoms were reported in athleteNC, suggesting that they were more likely to report multiple symptoms. Regardless of MC function, there was a significant, positive association between bleeding and symptoms ( P < 0.001), where athletes were more likely to report one or more symptoms on bleeding (50.1%) compared with nonbleeding days (22.0%). We describe an innovative strategy to investigate the effect of MC function and MC phase in a high-performance sport environment, including approaches to address the challenges of undertaking research with female athletes with MC variability and those using exogenous hormonal therapies.",['McKay AKA; Minahan C; Harris R; McCormick R; Skinner J; Ackerman KE; Burke LM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38109054,twenty-four Australian first nation female rugby league athletes completed this study. athletes reported their MC function and any associated symptoms. athletes were more likely to report multiple symptoms.
Prescribed-Time Output Feedback Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Output Constraints and Malicious Attacks.,"This article presents a prescribed-time output feedback control (PTOFC) algorithm for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) under output constraint occurring in any finite time interval (OC-AFT) and malicious attacks. The OC-AFT meaning that the output constraint only occurs during a finite number of time periods while being absent in others, which is more general and complex than traditional infinite-time/deferred output constraints. A stretch model-based nonlinear mapping function is constructed to handle the OC-AFT, and a salient advantage is that the proposed algorithm is also suit for CPSs with infinite-time/deferred output (or funnel) constraints, as well as those that are constraint-free, without necessitating changes to the control structure. The uncertain terms (including system model uncertainties, malicious attacks, and external disturbances) are compensated by fuzzy logic systems. Furthermore, a novel practical prescribed-time stability criterion is proposed, under which a novel PTOFC scheme is given. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can ensure that both tracking error and observation error converge to a neighborhood centered on zero within a prescribed time, while accommodating the OC-AFT and malicious attacks. Additionally, the settling time remains unaffected by control parameters and initial states, and the limitations of excessive initial control inputs and singularity problems in existing prescribed-time control algorithms are eliminated. The developed algorithm is exemplified through simulation instances.",['Yao Y; Kang Y; Zhao Y; Li P; Tan J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38995705,"prescribed-time output feedback control (PTOFC) algorithm for cyber-physical systems under output constraint occurring in any finite time interval (OC-AFT) and malicious attacks. proposed algorithm is suit for CPSs with infinite-time/deferred output constraints, as well as those that are constraint-free."
Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Children and Adolescents: A Case for Revised Diagnostic Parameters.,"Vitamin B12 deficiency is commonly diagnosed using thresholds developed for adults, yet emerging evidence indicates these levels may not be appropriate for children and adolescents. This misalignment can lead to underdiagnosis in younger populations, with potential long-term health implications. Chief Complaint: The 17-year-old female patient experienced severe fatigue, menstrual irregularities, psychological distress, and neurological symptoms over several years. The 13-year-old male patient had behavioral changes, gastrointestinal complaints, and sensory disturbances from an early age.Diagnosis: Both adolescents displayed B12 levels that were considered low-normal based on adult thresholds, complicating their diagnostic processes. Their diverse and atypical symptomatology required a comprehensive review of their medical and family histories, clinical symptoms, and risk factors.Intervention: Treatment included administration of hydroxocobalamin injections, complemented by dietary adjustments.Outcome: Both patients responded well to the treatment, showing significant improvements in their symptoms and overall quality of life. The main takeaway from these cases is the importance of tailoring diagnostic adequate thresholds and treatment plans to the pediatric population to address and manage B12 deficiency effectively. This approach can significantly enhance patient outcomes and prevent the progression of potentially severe complications in later life.",['Plattel CHM; Lever S; Simons CPM; Haitsma V'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38987874,vitamin B12 deficiency is commonly diagnosed using thresholds developed for adults. emerging evidence indicates these levels may not be appropriate for children and adolescents. this can lead to underdiagnosis in younger populations.
Management of polycystic ovary syndrome among Indian women using myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol.,"Myo-Inositol and D-chiro-inositol (MI-DCI) are used in the treatment of polycystic Ovary syndrome (PCOS) due to their insulin-sensitizing actions. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the treatment patterns, clinical effectiveness and safety of MI-DCI combination in anagement of PCOS in Indian women. Data from 50 healthcare centers across India was collected between September 2019 and February 2020 and was used in the study. Women aged 12-45 years diagnosed with PCOS, who had received MI-DCI (550-150 mg) were included. The outcome parameters were change in weight, luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, hirsutism, blood glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR, and lipid profile. A total of 283 women were included (mean age: 27.74 years; body mass index: 26.89 kg/m2); of which 197 (69.61%) reported reduction in weight after treatment with MI-DCI. The hirsutism scores considerably improved after treatment and the proportion of patients with, no hirsutism increased from 31.07% to 50.51% and moderate hirsutism reduced from 32.52% to 6.12% while, there were no patients with severe hirsutism after the treatment. There was a significant reduction in LH:FSH ratio (mean difference: 0.25 mg/dL; p=0.021), free testosterone (mean difference: 1.49; p<0.001) and dehydroepiandrosterone (mean difference: 21.49; P<0.001) levels after regular use of MI-DCI tablets. Treatment with MI-DCI resulted in significant improvement in insulin levels, HOMA-IR score, Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG) and lipid profile. The therapy restored menstruation and spontaneous ovulation and significantly attenuated the LH/FSH ratio. Thus, MI-DCI (550-150 mg) has shown multidimensional benefits in improving the hormonal, glycemic, and lipid profile of women with PCOS with considerable efficacy and tolerability.",['Vyas L; Raiturker AP; Sud S; Goyyal P; Abhyankar M; Revankar S; Walia S'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36420435,"myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. the treatment patterns, clinical effectiveness and safety of MI-DCI combination are of interest. women aged 12-45 years diagnosed with PCOS were included."
"Menstrual health and hygiene among Juang women: a particularly vulnerable tribal group in Odisha, India.","Menstruation is a normal biological process that all women go through, yet it is shrouded in secrecy, taboos, and even stigma in many societies. Studies have shown that women from socially disadvantaged groups are more likely to have preventable reproductive health issues and have less understanding of hygienic menstrual practices. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an insight into the most sensitive issue of menstruation and menstrual hygiene practices among the women of the Juang tribe, recognized as one of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTG) in India. A cross-sectional study using a mixed-method approach was carried out among Juang women in Keonjhar district of Odisha, India. Quantitative data was gathered from 360 currently married women to assess practices associated with menstruation and its management. In addition, 15 focus group discussions and 15 in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the views of Juang women on menstrual hygiene practices, cultural beliefs, menstrual problems, and treatment-seeking behaviour. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data, while descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests were used to analyse quantitative data. Most Juang women (85%) used old clothes as absorbents during menstruation. Distance from the market (36%), lack of awareness (31%), and high cost (15%) were cited as the contributing factors to the low level of sanitary napkin usage. Around 85% of women were restricted from participating in religious activities, and 94% avoided social gatherings. Seventy-one percent of the Juang women experienced menstrual problems, while only one-third of them sought treatment for their problems. Hygienic practices during menstruation are far from satisfactory among Juang women in Odisha, India. Menstrual problems are common, and the treatment sought is insufficient. There is a need for awareness generation on menstrual hygiene, the adverse effects of menstrual problems, and the provision of low-cost sanitary napkins among this disadvantaged, vulnerable tribal group.",['Mudi PK; Pradhan MR; Meher T'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36998075,women from socially disadvantaged groups are more likely to have preventable reproductive health issues. study aims to provide an insight into the most sensitive issue of menstruation and menstrual hygiene practices among the women of the Juang tribe.
Women's views and experiences of their vaginal bleeding patterns: an international perspective from Norplant users.,"Contraceptive-induced vaginal bleeding changes may be an undesired side effect, or a welcome opportunity to alter menstrual patterns. In Europe and the US, such changes are increasingly accepted; this study explores the perceptions of women around the globe. Norplant users from five countries (Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia and Tunisia; N = 486) were surveyed at entry into a contraceptive clinical trial regarding preferred frequency of menstruation, menses-associated symptoms, and activities during menses. Most women preferred once-monthly menstruation (81%); women in Chile, younger women, women neither married nor cohabitating, Christian women, and women experienced with hormonal contraception were more likely to accept alternative bleeding patterns. Women in Tunisia and Chile reported more symptoms associated with menses, while women in Beijing reported very few; decreased energy (32%), headaches (26%), abdominal pain (23%) and depression (22%) were most common. Avoidance of activities during menses such as physical work, sports, praying and entering religious sites, was closely tied to study centre. Across all sites, women (90%) avoided sexual intercourse during menses. Despite growing acceptance of altering bleeding patterns, women in this study preferred monthly vaginal bleeding. Understanding sociocultural contexts and individual preferences is important when addressing this issue with women from diverse backgrounds.","[""d'Arcangues C; Jackson E; Brache V; Piaggio G""]",2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21138370,women in five countries preferred monthly vaginal bleeding. women in china and the us preferred monthly vaginal bleeding. women in china and china preferred monthly vaginal bleeding.
"""Es que tú eres una changa"": stigma experiences among Latina women living with endometriosis.","Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynecologic disease affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age of all ethnicities. Symptoms of this painful condition impact the physical, mental health, and quality of life of patients. Stigma is a social determinant of health documented to negatively impact people living with chronic conditions and have been associated with social exclusion, high levels of stress, and interference with medical care. The purpose of this study was to document stigma experiences among Latina women living with endometriosis. A qualitative design using focus groups was implemented. Thematic analysis was conducted for data interpretation. A total of 50 women participated in five focus groups. The main theme ""<i>changuería</i>"" emerged as a label applied across multiple contexts and interactions in the lives of participants, suggesting that stigmatization is an ever-present barrier among women living with endometriosis.

Iron deficiency anemia among women: An issue of health equity.,"Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional deficiency in the world. For women, the risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia increases due to iron demands during pregnancy and regular iron losses due to menstruation during reproductive years. These interrelated conditions are of public health concern as they are highly prevalent, and the negative consequences such as chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment and poor quality of life are broad and multifaceted. People of low socioeconomic status are at higher risk of iron deficiency due to low intake of expensive iron-rich foods, and decreased access to healthcare. In this review, we applied a health equity lens to describe the current state of care for women with iron deficiency with or without anemia.

FLOW (finding lasting options for women): multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing tampons with menstrual cups.,"To determine whether menstrual cups are a viable alternative to tampons. Randomized controlled trial. Prince George, Victoria, and Vancouver, BC. A total of 110 women aged 19 to 40 years who had previously used tampons as their main method of menstrual management. Participants were randomized into 2 groups, a tampon group and a menstrual cup group. Using online diaries, participants tracked 1 menstrual cycle using their regular method and 3 menstrual cycles using the method of their allocated group. Overall satisfaction; secondary outcomes included discomfort, urovaginal infection, cost, and waste. Forty-seven women in each group completed the final survey, 5 of whom were subsequently excluded from analysis (3 from the tampon group and 2 from the menstrual cup group). Overall satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale was higher for the menstrual cup group than for the tampon group (mean [standard deviation] score 5.4 [1.5] vs 5.0 [1.0], respectively; P=.04). Approximately 91% of women in the menstrual cup group said they would continue to use the cup and recommend it to others. Women used a median of 13 menstrual products per cycle, or 169 products per year, which corresponds to approximately 771,248,400 products used annually in Canada. Estimated cost for tampon use was $37.44 a year (similar to the retail cost of 1 menstrual cup). Subjective vaginal discomfort was initially higher in the menstrual cup group, but the discomfort decreased with continued use. There was no significant difference in physician-diagnosed urovaginal symptoms between the 2 groups. Both of the menstrual management methods evaluated were well tolerated by subjects. Menstrual cups are a satisfactory alternative to tampons and have the potential to be a sustainable solution to menstrual management, with moderate cost savings and much-reduced environmental effects compared with tampons.

Development and content validation of two new patient-reported outcome measures for endometriosis: the Endometriosis Symptom Diary (ESD) and Endometriosis Impact Scale (EIS).,"Endometriosis is a common, chronic, impactful condition in women of reproductive age. In the absence of established sensitive and specific biomarkers, disease severity is determined by patient-reported symptoms and impacts. This article details the development of two new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures designed to assess efficacy endpoints in clinical studies: The Endometriosis Symptom Diary (ESD) and the Endometriosis Impact Scale (EIS). The ESD and EIS were developed according to best practice and scientific standards (including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) PRO Guidance) and with extensive input from women with surgically-confirmed endometriosis. Research included: a review of published qualitative literature; concept elicitation interviews in the US, Germany and France (n = 45) to explore the experiences of women with endometriosis and to inform ESD and EIS development; and cognitive interviews in the US and Germany (n = 31) to assess relevance and understanding of the ESD and EIS and usability of administration using an electronic handheld device. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as PRO and clinical experts were consulted throughout the process. Pelvic pain was identified as the most frequent, severe and bothersome symptom for women with endometriosis. Pain was reported to be greatest during menstruation (dysmenorrhea) and during or after sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Pain resulted in significant impairments in physical activities, work/study, social/leisure activities, household activities and sexual functioning. All women highlighted the emotional impact of endometriosis. Descriptions of pain and associated impacts were largely consistent across participants from the US and Europe, with the most notable differences being the words used to describe the location of pain (e.g., 'pelvis' vs. 'abdomen'). Testing during cognitive interviews indicated that the ESD and EIS were well understood and consistently interpreted. Furthermore, all participants found the ePRO devices easy to use and no issues regarding visual presentation, selection of responses or navigation were identified. Evidence from extensive qualitative research supports the content validity of the ESD and EIS as patient-reported measures of the disease-defining symptoms of endometriosis and the associated impact on women's lives.

Germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (also known as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, referred to here as BRCA1/2 PVs) are well known to significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers in female carriers, and knowledge of BRCA1/2 PVs informs established cancer screening and options for risk reduction. While risks to male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs are less characterized, there is convincing evidence of increased risk for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer in males. There has also been a rapid expansion of US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted cancer therapies, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, for breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers associated with BRCA1/2 PVs. This narrative review summarized the data that inform cancer risks, targeted cancer therapy options, and guidelines for early cancer detection. It also highlighted areas of emerging research and clinical trial opportunities for male BRCA1/2 PV carriers. These developments, along with the continued relevance to family cancer risk and reproductive options, have informed changes to guideline recommendations for genetic testing and strengthened the case for increased genetic testing for males. Despite increasing clinical actionability for male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs, far fewer males than female individuals undergo cancer genetic testing. Oncologists, internists, and primary care clinicians should be vigilant about offering appropriate genetic testing to males. Identifying more male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs will maximize opportunities for cancer early detection, targeted risk management, and cancer treatment for males, along with facilitating opportunities for risk reduction and prevention in their family members, thereby decreasing the burden of hereditary cancer.",['Cheng HH; Shevach JW; Castro E; Couch FJ; Domchek SM; Eeles RA; Giri VN; Hall MJ; King MC; Lin DW; Loeb S; Morgan TM; Offit K; Pritchard CC; Schaeffer EM; Szymaniak BM; Vassy JL; Katona BW; Maxwell KN'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052257,"half of all carriers of inherited cancer-predisposing variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are male. but the implications for their health are underrecognized compared to female individuals. study reveals evidence of increased risk for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer in male carriers."
"Prevalence and determinant factors of premenstrual syndrome among secondary and preparatory school students in Dessie city administration, Northeast Ethiopia.","In Ethiopia, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was predominantly studied among university students who were in their early 20s; as a result, little is known about the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome among adolescent girls. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and identify factors associated with premenstrual syndrome among secondary school female students in the Dessie city administration, 2023. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving a sample of 630 participants. A structured self-administered data collection tool was used to gather the necessary information. To ensure data quality, the pretesting and training of the data collectors and supervisors were conducted. The collected data were entered into Epi-data software and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Frequency tables, graphs, means, and medians were used to describe the characteristics of the study participants. Binary logistic regression was employed to identify significant factors. Variables with a p-value ≤ 0.05 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) in the final multivariable logistic regression were reported as statistically significant factors associated with PMS. Model fitness was evaluated using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. In the present study, the prevalence of PMS was 22%, 95% CI = 19-26%. Age ≥ 18 years (AOR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.86), duration of menstruation ≥ 7 days (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI: 1.25, 10.37), presence of chronic illness (AOR = 2.08; 95% CI:1.04, 4.16), coffee intake (AOR = 6.05; 95% CI: 2.05, 17.87), alcohol intake (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.86), use of pain medication (AOR = 2.06; 95% CI:1.10, 3.86), use of hormonal contraceptives (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI:1.58, 9.62), sleep disturbance (AOR = 3.82; 95% CI: 2.29, 6.42) and physical exercise (AOR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.87) were significantly associated with PMS. A significant number of students in this study were affected by premenstrual syndrome. Age, duration of menstruation, presence of chronic illness, coffee intake, use of pain medication, use of hormonal contraceptives, and sleep disturbance were significantly associated with PMS.

Understanding Adolescents' Experiences With Menstrual Pain to Inform the User-Centered Design of a Mindfulness-Based App: Mixed Methods Investigation Study.,"Digital interventions are increasingly popular for the provision of nonpharmacological pain interventions, but few exist for adolescents with menstrual pain. User-centered design involves incorporating users across phases of digital health intervention design, development, and implementation and leads to improved user engagement and outcomes. A needs assessment is the first step of this approach. The goal of this study was to conduct a needs assessment to understand menstrual pain management needs and preferences and mindfulness experiences, preferences, and knowledge of adolescents with menstrual pain to inform the future development of an app for managing menstrual pain. We used an explanatory sequential mixed method design that included a survey followed by focus groups. Adolescents aged 13-17 years completed a survey (n=111) and participated in focus groups (n=16). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis and synthesized to provide specific recommendations based on adolescent responses. Adolescents (n=111) who completed the survey reported a moderate understanding of mindfulness and menstrual pain. Over three-quarters (n=87, 78%) of participants practiced some form of mindfulness and 87% (n=97) of survey participants used nonpharmacological pain management strategies. Teens had a moderate perception that mindfulness could help their menstrual pain (mean 4.51/10, SD 2.45, with higher scores suggesting more interest). Themes were generated related to mindfulness experiences, menstrual pain knowledge and experiences, and app functionality. These themes underscored adolescents' need for continued support and flexible access to mindfulness activities; their awareness of multiple influences to pain, with potential for further education in this area; and the need for menstrual pain-specific content, along with content relevant to typical day-to-day experiences of adolescents. Adolescents with menstrual pain have an interest in using a mindfulness app for pain but have unique needs that need to be addressed to ensure app engagement and relevance for this population. Concrete recommendations for future app development are provided.",['Gagnon MM; Brilz AR; Alberts NM; Gordon JL; Risling TL; Stinson JN'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38587886,a needs assessment is the first step of this approach. the aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment. adolescents aged 13-17 years completed a survey.
Ayurveda management of infertility associated with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome: A case report.,"Infertility associated with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a major cause of concern in the present generation among the reproductive age groups due to undesirable lifestyle changes. This is a case report of an infertile couple who had not been able to conceive since 11 yrs. The wife was diagnosed with PCOS. They underwent conventional treatments of primary infertility including IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination) and hormonal therapy both the treatments were unsuccessful. The objective of the present treatment included Ayurvedic management of PCOS, ensuring regular ovulation and thereby helping to develop healthy pregnancy and successful childbirth. Based on the parameters of Ayurvedic science this case was diagnosed as Vandhyatva (Infertility) due to Nashtartava (Amenorrhea). Treatment plan included both Shodhana (Purification) and Shamana (mitigation) therapies. During the treatment period she lost 20 kg of weight and regained regular menstruation thereafter. The outcome of the Ayurvedic intervention was the conception of the patient within 8 months of treatment and delivery of a healthy baby girl.",['Asmabi MA; Jithesh MK'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980524,infertility associated with poly Cystic Ovarian syndrome is a major cause of concern in the present generation among the reproductive age groups due to undesirable lifestyle changes. the wife was diagnosed with PCOS. they underwent conventional treatments of primary infertility including IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination) and hormonal therapy both the treatments were unsuccessful.
A Novel Role for the Longevity-Associated Protein SLC39A11 as a Manganese Transporter.,"The identification of aging- and longevity-associated genes is important for promoting healthy aging. By analyzing a large cohort of Chinese centenarians, we previously found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>SLC39A11</i> gene (also known as <i>ZIP11</i>) are associated with longevity in males. However, the function of the SLC39A11 protein remains unclear. Here, we found that <i>SLC39A11</i> expression is significantly reduced in patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). In addition, we found that zebrafish with a mutation in <i>slc39a11</i> that significantly reduces its expression have an accelerated aging phenotype, including a shortened average lifespan, muscle atrophy and reduced swimming, impaired muscle regeneration, gut damage, and abnormal morphology in the reproductive system. Interestingly, these signs of premature aging were more pronounced in male zebrafish than in females. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that cellular senescence may serve as a potential mechanism for driving this <i>slc39a11</i> deficiency-induced phenotype in mutant zebrafish. Moreover, immunofluorescence showed significantly increased DNA damage and reactive oxygen species signaling in <i>slc39a11</i> mutant zebrafish. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), we found that manganese significantly accumulates in <i>slc39a11</i> mutant zebrafish, as well as in the serum of both global <i>Slc39a11</i> knockout and hepatocyte-specific <i>Slc39a11</i> knockout mice, suggesting that this metal transporter regulates systemic manganese levels. Finally, using cultured human fibroblasts, we found that both knocking down <i>SLC39A11</i> and exposure to high extracellular manganese increased cellular senescence. These findings provide compelling evidence that SLC39A11 serves to protect against the aging process, at least in part by regulating cellular manganese homeostasis.",['Xia Z; Tang B; Li X; Li X; Jia Y; Jiang J; Chen J; Song J; Liu S; Min J; Wang F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39114488,a novel role for the longevity-associated protein SLC39A11 as a manganese transporter is important for promoting healthy aging. the function of the SLC39A11 protein remains unclear. zebrafish with a mutation in i>slc39a11/i> that significantly reduces its expression have an accelerated aging phenotype.
Decomposing the rural-urban gap in hygienic material use during menstruation among adolescent women in India.,"The use of hygienic materials (sanitary napkins, locally prepared napkins, tampons, and menstrual cups) during menstruation among adolescent women in India has improved over the years, yet a significant rural-urban gap in the usage persists at the national level. This study investigates how this rural-urabn gap varies across different states and union territories (UTs) of India and uses Fairlie decomposition to quantify the contribution of various factors to this gap. The study uses data on 114,805 adolescent women (aged 15-19 years) from the fifith round of National Family Health Survey (2019-21). The utilization of hygienic materials during menstruation among adolescent women in rural India stood at 43%, whereas in urban areas, it was 68%, indicating a significant 25 percentage point (pp) difference between the two. The rural-urban gap in the hygienic material use varied significantly across Indian states and UTs. The gap exceeded 20 pp in Madhya Pradesh (36 pp), Odisha (26 pp), Jammu and Kashmir (25 pp), Assam (25 pp), Uttar Pradesh (23 pp), Jharkhand (22 pp), Chhattisgarh (21 pp), and Rajasthan (21 pp). In contrast, the gap in Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, and Telangana was less than 10 pp. The decomposition analysis of the rural-urban gap (25 pp) revealed that the variables included in the anlaysis explained about 70% of the gap. The difference in the household wealth between rural and urban areas contributed about 69% of the explained gap. Other significant contributors to the explained gap were 'transportation to health facility' (5.6%), 'mass-media exposure' (4.9%), and 'level of education (4.4%). The findings underscore the necessity for state-specific interventions aimed at vulnerable groups, particularly individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, those with lower levels of education, and limited exposure to mass media, in order to reduce the existing rural-urban disparity in hygienic material use among adolescent women.",['Chakrabarty M; Singh A; Let S; Singh S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38104217,"the rural-urban gap in hygienic material use during menstruation has improved over the years. the gap exceeded 20 pp in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, assam, Uttar Pradesh, assam, and Uttar Pradesh."
"REPRODUCTIVE AGEING: BGP-15 mitigates adverse impacts of aging on sperm quality, fertility, and offspring health in male mice.","Aging in men is associated with diminished sperm quality and a higher incidence of altered fetal development and miscarriage in resultant pregnancies. This study in mice identifies a therapeutic compound that, when administered to aged males, improves sperm quality, subsequent embryo development and post-natal offspring health. Aging in men is associated with diminished sperm quality and a higher incidence of altered fetal development and miscarriage in resultant pregnancies. We used a mouse model of advanced paternal age to characterize embryonic development in older male mice and tested whether pre-conception treatment with the mitochondrial activator BGP-15 improves reproductive outcomes in old males. Like older men, reproductively old male mice had higher levels of sperm DNA damage and delayed pre-implantation development, associated with a reduced fetal weight and placental weight. Analysis of neonatal outcomes of in vivo-conceived offspring found that pups sired by old males were smaller, had delayed locomotor development, and increased mortality. BGP-15 treatment for 5 days prior to conception reduced sperm DNA oxidation levels and improved on-time embryo development after IVF and pup survival. BGP-15 treatment for 3 weeks prior to conception improved on-time pre-implantation embryo development and fetal viability and increased fetal size in pregnancies sired by old males. These results validate that ageing negatively affects male fertility and offspring physiology and indicates that pre-conception treatment with BGP-15 has the potential to improve sperm quality as well as early embryo development and post-natal health.",['Gonzalez MB; Campugan CA; Connaughton HS; Andreas E; Winstanley YE; Williams EJ; Dorian CL; Robertson SA; Shoubridge C; Robker RL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096934,"aging in men is associated with diminished sperm quality and a higher incidence of altered fetal development and miscarriage in resultant pregnancies. a therapeutic compound that, when administered to aged males, improves sperm quality, subsequent embryo development and post-natal offspring health."
Laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis of the round ligament: A case of a patient with right-sided inguinal pain.,"Round ligament endometriosis is a rare phenomenon reported in approximately 0.3% to 0.6% of endometriosis cases. Presurgical diagnosis is carried out for about 50% of the cases. The association of the right-sided inguinal hernia, nonspecific pain in the organs, and no history of surgery or labor make the diagnosis intricate. We report a case of endometriosis of the round ligament in a 39-year-old woman who complained of intense pain in the right groin during the menstrual period for about 4 years, with no complaints of bulging or change in the size of the mentioned area. The clinical suspicion of inguinal endometriosis, supported by sonography and magnetic resonance imaging, was confirmed by histological examination of the surgical specimen after laparoscopic surgery, which included the mass and the extraperitoneal segment of the round ligament. After surgery, the patient's pain disappeared completely. The round ligament endometriosis or endometriosis of the inguinal region could be considered an important differential diagnosis in women of reproductive age without a history of surgery who presented with inguinal region pain during menstruation but no clear mass was palpable in the physical exam.",['Rokhgireh S; MehdizadehKashi A; Noroozi SG; Aminzade Z; Derakhshan R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044436,"round ligament endometriosis is a rare phenomenon reported in 0.3% to 0.6% of endometriosis cases. presurgical diagnosis is carried out for about 50% of the cases. the association of the right-sided inguinal hernia, nonspecific pain in the organs, and no history of surgery or labor make the diagnosis intricate."
Machine Learning for Movement Pattern Changes during Kinect-Based Mixed Reality Exercise Programs in Women with Possible Sarcopenia: Pilot Study.,"Sarcopenia is a muscle wasting condition that affects elderly individuals. It can lead to changes in movement patterns, which can increase the risk of falls and other injuries. Elderly women participants aged ≥65 years who could walk independently were recruited and classified into two groups based on knee extension strength (KES). Participants with low KES scores were assigned to the possible sarcopenia group (PSG, n=7) and an 8-week exercise intervention was implemented. Healthy seniors with high KES scores were classified as the reference group (RG, n=4), and a 3-week exercise intervention was conducted. Kinematic movement data were recorded during the intervention period. All participants' exercise repetitions were used in the data analysis (number of data points =1,128). The PSG showed significantly larger movement patterns in knee rotation during wide squats compared to the RG, attributed to weakened lower limb strength. The voting classifier, trained on the movement patterns from wide squats, determined that significant differences in overall movement patterns between the two groups persisted until the end of the exercise intervention. However, after the exercise intervention, significant improvements in lower limb strength in the PSG resulted in reduced knee rotation ROM and Max, thereby stabilizing movements and eliminating significant differences with the RG. This study suggests that exercise interventions can modify the movement patterns in elderly individuals with possible sarcopenia. These findings provide fundamental data for developing an exercise management system that remotely tracks and monitors the movement patterns of older adults during exercise activities.",['Sung Y; Seo JW; Lim B; Jiang S; Li X; Jamrasi P; Ahn SY; Ahn S; Kang Y; Shin H; Kim D; Yoon DH; Song W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39021131,"women aged 65 years who could walk independently were recruited and classified into two groups based on knee extension strength (KES) participants with low KES scores were assigned to the possible sarcopenia group (PSG, n=7) and an 8-week exercise intervention was implemented."
Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation.,"Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is excessively heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or to recognisable pelvic or systemic disease. Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but, in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those who are at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 4 May 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (1985 to May 2007), CINAHL (1982 to May 2007), Biological Abstracts (1969 to May 2007), Current Contents (1980 to 2007) and reference lists of articles. All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. Both authors were experts in the content matter. No randomised trials were identified which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Only one small, non-randomised study compared two progestogen regimes in the management of heavy and irregular bleeding in women with confirmed anovulation. One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in women with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia. There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Further research is needed to establish the role of these treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.",['Hickey M; Higham J; Fraser IS'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17943761,"anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding. menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women."
Effect of acute moderate-intensity cycling on cfDNA levels considering menstrual cycle phases.,"We aimed to determine the effects of exercise on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels and concentration changes during the menstrual cycle in participants with regular menstrual cycles and no exercise habits. Eleven sedentary female students with regular menstrual cycles and ovulation performed bicycle exercises at 60% VO<sub>2max</sub> for 30 min during the menstrual, ovulatory, and luteal phases. Blood samples were collected before (Pre), immediately after (Post 0), 30 min after (Post 30), and 60 min after (Post 60) exercise. Blood concentrations of ovarian hormones, cfDNA, prostaglandin F2a (PGF2α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and aromatase were evaluated. Based on the concentration of ovarian hormones, seven individuals were finally analyzed. No significant phase difference was observed in cfDNA across all time points. cfDNA (menstrual phase: <i>p</i> = 0.028, ovulatory phase: <i>p</i> = 0.018, and luteal phase: <i>p</i> = 0.048) and aromatase concentrations (menstrual phase: <i>p</i> = 0.040, ovulatory phase: <i>p</i> = 0.039, and luteal phase: <i>p</i> = 0.045) significantly increased from Pre to Post 0 in all phases. Serum estradiol (E2) levels were significantly higher in the luteal phase at all time points than in the menstrual phase (Pre: <i>p</i> < 0.001, Post 0: <i>p</i> < 0.001, Post 30: <i>p</i> = 0.005, and Post 60: <i>p</i> = 0.011); however, serum progesterone (P4) levels were significantly higher in the luteal phase at all time points than in the menstrual (Pre: <i>p</i> < 0.001, Post 0: <i>p</i> < 0.001, Post 30: <i>p</i> < 0.001, and Post 60: <i>p</i> < 0.001) and ovulatory phases (Pre: <i>p</i> = 0.005, Post 0: <i>p</i> = 0.005, Post 30: <i>p</i> = 0.003, and Post 60: <i>p</i> = 0.003). E2 levels significantly increased from Pre to Post 0 in the ovulatory and luteal phases, whereas P4 levels increased in the luteal phase. Progesterone to estradiol level ratio (P4/E2) changes from Pre to Post 0 (%baseline) during the luteal phase were significantly negatively correlated (<i>r</i> = -0.82, <i>p</i> = 0.046) with the changes in cfDNA from Pre to Post 0. Furthermore, the repeated measures correlation between P4/E2 and cfDNA level showed a significant negative correlation in ovulatory and luteal phases. The results indicate that while resting cfDNA levels are unlikely to be affected by a woman's menstrual cycle, the increase in cfDNA after exercise is higher in the ovulatory phase (when only E2 increases) and lower in the luteal phase (when E2 and P4 increase with exercise) compared to that in the menstrual phase (when E2 and P4 are in low levels), suggesting the contribution of increased ovarian hormone levels after exercise.",['Sawai A; Shida T; Hoshikawa Y; Hatanaka S; Ueda M; Kato Y; Tokinoya K; Natsui H; Kawakami Y; Takekoshi K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38348376,"sedentary female students performed bicycle exercises at 60% VOsub>2max/sub> for 30 min during the menstrual, ovulatory, and luteal phases. blood samples were collected before (Pre), immediately after (Post 0), 30 min after (Post 30) and 60 min after (Post 60) exercise."

The effect of iron supplementation on menstrual bleeding volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding : A randomized clinical trial.,"Many women around the world avoid taking iron supplements during their menstrual bleeding, thinking that menstrual bleeding will increase after taking these supplements. Due to the lack of relevant scientific evidence in this regard, this study was performed to determine the effect of iron supplementation on menstrual blood volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding. In this three-blind randomized clinical trial, 160 non-anemic female students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences were selected through a public call and then they were randomly assigned to two intervention and control groups. The intervention group was given a ferrous sulfate tablet containsing 50 mg of elemental iron daily in the first four days of bleeding for three consecutive menstrual cycles, and the control group received a placebo simultaneously. Before and after the intervention, the level of hemoglobin was measured and the Higham chart was completed in each menstrual cycle by the participants of the two groups. The obtained data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 21 and Chi-square, independent <i>t</i>-test, paired <i>t</i>-test, analysis of variance with repeated measures, and nonparametric tests. Before performing the intervention, the mean Higham score and hemoglobin level of the two groups were not statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.307, <i>P</i> = 0.670). The mean Higham score after each intervention was not statistically significant between the two groups over time or when considering the interaction of the time group (<i>P</i> = 0.77, <i>P</i> = 0.916). The hemoglobin level of these two groups did not change significantly after the intervention compared with that before the intervention (<i>P</i> = 0.444). Compared with a placebo, taking iron supplements containing 50 mg of elemental iron during the first four days of menstrual bleeding in non-anemic women did not change the volume of menstrual bleeding and hemoglobin level.",['MokhtarKalimi E; Loripoor M; Rezaeian M; Gholamrezapour M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38532920,study was performed to determine the effect of iron supplementation on menstrual bleeding volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding. the study was performed to determine the effect of iron supplementation on menstrual bleeding volume and hemoglobin level during menstrual bleeding.
The menstrual cycle regularity and skin: irregular menstrual cycle affects skin physiological properties and skin bacterial microbiome in urban Chinese women.,"The regularity of the menstrual cycle directly affects women's health. Many studies have focused on menstrual health; however, menstrual cycle regularity-related variations in skin physiological characteristics and skin microbiota have been seldom investigated. To investigate the menstrual cycle regularity-related variations in skin physiological characteristics and skin microbiota of 197 cases of Chinese women aged 18-35 years living in shanghai in 2021. Based on a self-evaluation questionnaire, the volunteers were divided into three groups C1 (those with a regular menstrual cycle), C2 (those with a less regular menstrual cycle) and C3 (those with an irregular menstrual cycle). The physiological parameters of facial skin were measured by non-invasive methods and the skin microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. In the C3 group, the hydration content was significantly decreased (p < 0.05), the TEWL was significantly increased (p < 0.05), and the sebum content was increased (p > 0.05), indicating that the skin barrier integrity weakened with increased menstrual cycle irregularity. Additionally, the melanin level, L value and b value were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the C3 group, but the a value was significantly increased (p < 0.001), which indicated that the skin color became darker. Furthermore, the skin microbiota diversity decreased with increasing cycle irregularity, but the differences were not significant. The skin microbiota composition showed that the proportion of Firmicutes, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Cutibacterium were increased in those with an irregular menstrual cycle, indicating that alterations in the ratio of bacterial phyla and/or genera might disturb skin homeostasis. Spearman correlation analysis revealed strong correlations between the microbiota and skin physiological parameters. Based on the associations among hormones, skin physiological parameters and skin microbiota, it is possible that the skin physiological parameters, as well as the skin microbial diversity and composition, change with hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle.

Hormonal contraceptive use in Ghana: The role of method attributes and side effects in method choice and continuation.,"To understand the barriers and facilitators of hormonal contraceptive use among Ghanaian women, in order to help improve contraceptive counseling and reduce the high rates of unintended pregnancy. We conducted a nationally representative community-based survey of 4143 women aged 15-49 in 2018, and used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to examine correlates of current hormonal method use, preferred method attributes and their association with method choice, and the role of side effects in hormonal method discontinuation. Hormonal method use (vs. contraceptive non-use) was associated with younger age, higher parity and education, but not with union status, wealth or residence. Preferences for key method attributes were associated with choosing particular methods. Most valued attributes were effectiveness at preventing pregnancy, and low risks of harming health and future fertility. These last 2 concerns are echoed in the second most common reason for discontinuation (health concerns). While menstrual changes were a common concern, leading some respondents to discontinue hormonal contraceptives, many were willing to endure these effects. In contrast, having experienced long-term health issues as a perceived result of hormonal method use more than halved the odds of current use. Contraceptive counseling on menstrual changes, other side effects, and impacts on future fertility had not been universally provided. Ghanaian women value hormonal methods for their effectiveness against pregnancy. However, concerns about side effects (particularly bleeding changes), future fertility impairment, and long-term health issues led some women to discontinue hormonal methods. Counseling on these issues was reportedly inadequate. Identifying barriers to, and facilitators of, hormonal contraceptive use, as well as method attributes important to Ghanaian women, can help to better tailor contraceptive counseling to individual needs, in order to ensure that all women can access the method that suits them best, and decide whether and how to manage side effects, switch methods or discontinue.",['Keogh SC; Otupiri E; Castillo PW; Chiu DW; Polis CB; Nakua EK; Bell SO'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33992609,hormonal contraceptive use in Ghana is a key factor in hormonal method discontinuation. the role of method attributes and side effects in method choice and continuation. the role of method attributes and side effects in method choice and continuation is a key factor.
Perspectives on menstrual policymaking and community-based actions in Catalonia (Spain): a qualitative study.,"Menstrual research and policymaking have become imperative worldwide. It is necessary that these are informed by women and people who menstruate (PWM) alongside expert professionals and activists. The main aim of this study was to identify and propose policies and community-based actions to address menstrual inequity and promote menstrual health in Catalonia (Spain). This study consisted of two qualitative studies: (a) 34 individual photoelicitation interviews with women and PWM, (b) a World Café study with 22 professionals and activists. Sampling for both studies was purposive and selective. Recruitment was conducted through healthcare centres, social media, key contacts, and snowball sampling techniques. Data were collected in December 2020-September 2022, and analysed using Framework Analysis. Participants considered the implementation of menstrual policies that address the taboo and stigma of menstruation to be crucial. They stressed the need for menstrual education, which should be integrated into formal education curricula. Participants, and especially women and PWM, highlighted the need to improve the access and quality of healthcare services, so that the menstrual cycle and menstruation are seen as health indicators. Health professionals should encourage agentic informed decisions, hence why both participant groups considered menstrual health education amongst health professionals to be pivotal. Taking action to improve the access and affordability of menstrual products was also imperative for participants, especially for socioeconomically vulnerable populations. Participants agreed on guaranteeing fully equipped menstrual management facilities, and and professionals discussed gender-neutral and sex-segregated bathrooms. Workplace menstrual policies to accommodate and ensure menstrual self-care were also suggested. Our study highlights the need for multi-dimensional menstrual policies. These should include actions to address menstrual taboo and stigma, to promote menstrual education that goes beyond the hegemonic biomedical prism, to improve the access and quality of menstrual health services, along with policies ensuring adequate menstrual management facilities in public spaces and the access to menstrual products. Policymaking should also focus on how to ensure menstrual management and care in workplaces. Menstrual policies and community-based actions should be framed within intersectionality, to consider how societal structures of power and oppression influence menstrual experiences.",['García-Egea A; Holst AS; Jacques-Aviñó C; Martínez-Bueno C; Berenguera A; Vicente-Hernández MM; Valls-Llobet C; Pinzón-Sanabria D; Pujolar-Díaz G; Medina-Perucha L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38178256,menstrual research and policymaking have become imperative worldwide. it is necessary that these are informed by women and people who menstruate. the main aim of this study was to identify and propose policies and community-based actions to address menstrual inequity and promote menstrual health in Catalonia (Spain)
The Changes in Menstrual and Menstrual-Related Symptoms among Japanese Female University Students: A Prospective Cohort Study from Three Months to Nine Months after Admission.,"Menstrual and menstrual-related symptoms can significantly impact an individual's physical and psychological health. Understanding how these symptoms evolve over time is crucial to provide appropriate support and healthcare services to young women. This study aimed to investigate changes in menstrual and menstrual-related symptoms among first-year female university students. A prospective longitudinal design was used to compare the symptom profiles between two time points (three and nine months after admission). Out of 100 female university students, 30 responses were analyzed. Data on menstrual and menstrual-related symptoms were collected using standardized questionnaires focusing on menstrual status and the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ); no notable changes occurred between the time points. Approximately half reported having irregular menstruation during the three time periods. Among the sub-scales, premenstrual ""impaired concentration"" showed a tendency to be lower, whereas menstrual ""water retention"" tended to be higher in timepoint 2 compared to timepoint 1. ""Distractible"" was found to be significantly lower in timepoint 2 compared to timepoint 1. There was a significant association between a sleep duration of <7 h and worsened MDQ scores. These findings may underscore the importance of providing comprehensive lifestyle and menstrual education to new university students, along with access to appropriate medical care.",['Matsuura Y; Tran NH; Yasui T'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37761754,study aimed to investigate changes in menstrual and menstrual-related symptoms. study compared symptom profiles between two time points. menstrual and menstrual-related symptoms can significantly impact individual's physical and psychological health.
Simultaneous Real and Momentum Space Electron Diffraction from a Fullerene Molecule.,"Plane-wave electrons undergo momentum transfer as they scatter off a target in overlapping spherical waves. The transferred momentum leads to target structural information to be encoded in angle and energy differential scattering. For symmetric, periodic, or structured targets this can engender diffraction in the electron intensity both in real and momentum space. With the example of elastic scattering from a C_{60} molecule we show these simultaneous diffraction signatures. Simulated angle-momentum diffractograms can be imaged in experiments with a two-dimensional detector and an energy-tunable electron gun. The result may inspire the invention of technology to extend scopes of electron diffraction studies, open a track of electron crystallography using the momentum-differential diffraction, and motivate research about controlling the time delay between the pump laser pulse and probe electron pulse by tuning the electron impact speed in ultrafast electron diffraction experiments.",['Aiswarya R; Shaik R; Jose J; Varma HR; Chakraborty HS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094158,diffraction signatures can be encoded in angle and energy differential scattering. diffraction signatures can be seen in experiments with a two-dimensional detector.
Editorial: It's Complicated: Adrenarcheal and Pubertal Hormonal Influence on Brain Development.,"Recent research has begun to establish the very important role of prepubertal, pubertal, and peripubertal neurodevelopment and the developmental expression of adolescent-onset psychiatric disorders. There are definite changes in the rates and expression of psychiatric disorders during this time period of marked hormonal changes, with increases in rates of both major depression and anxiety disorders, particularly in females, and a sharp increase in risk-taking behavior in both males and females. Recent reports underscore the critical roles that neurodevelopmental changes contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Typical pubertal developmental changes, such as generalized growth spurts, breast and genital bodily maturation, and the onset of menstruation are strongly related to developmental changes in hormonal expression. Until recently, however, many behavioral and psychiatric investigations (including neuroimaging investigations) did not measure hormonal levels. Such investigations, by a small number of investigators, have been completed over the past 5 to 10 years. These studies make it clear that we need to substantially increase our understanding of the endocrine-related neurodevelopmental processes in periadolescence and adolescence as they relate to the expression of many psychiatric. Barendse et al.,<sup>1</sup> published in this issue, reports some interesting findings that advance our understanding of adrenarcheal brain development, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its relationship to anxiety symptoms.",['Botteron KN'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32311474,adrenarcheal and pubertal neurodevelopmental influence on brain development. adrenarcheal and pubertal neurodevelopmental influence on brain development. adrenarcheal and pubertal neurodevelopmental influence on brain development.
The Association between Obesity and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: An Epidemiologic Study of Observational Data.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common female cardio-metabolic-reproductive disorder. It is unclear whether the global obesity epidemic is impacting the high PCOS prevalence. To determine the extent to which obesity contributes to the PCOS development globally. A systematic review was conducted to identify population studies on PCOS prevalence globally, through July 2023. Linear regression and random-effect models were applied to examine the association of mean body mass index (BMI) or obesity prevalence with the prevalence of PCOS diagnosed by 1990 National Institute of Health (NIH), 2003 Rotterdam (Rotterdam), and 2006 Androgen Excess-PCOS (AE-PCOS) criteria. Subgroup analyses were also conducted for recruitment methods and study quality. Fifty-eight studies with 85,956 adults from 24 countries were included. Considering all available data, a borderline association was observed between PCOS and obesity prevalence when using the AE-PCOS, but not the NIH or Rotterdam criteria. Alternatively, subgroup analysis of studies with better recruitment methods demonstrated a significant positive association of population mean BMI or obesity prevalence with PCOS prevalence when using the Rotterdam or AE-PCOS criteria, while using only high-quality studies revealed an association using NIH as well as Rotterdam and AE-PCOS criteria. Overall, we observed that a 1% increase in obesity prevalence resulted in an approximately 0.4% increase in PCOS prevalence by the Rotterdam criteria. These data indicate that obesity increases the development of PCOS, although the effect is modest. Our data also emphasizes the need to undertake only high-quality studies in assessing PCOS epidemiology.",['Amiri M; Hatoum S; Hopkins D; Buyalos RP; Ezeh U; Pace LA; Bril F; Sheidaei A; Azziz R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39078989,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female cardio-metabolic-reproductive disorder. it is unclear whether the global obesity epidemic is impacting the high PCOS prevalence.
Menopause status and attitudes in a Turkish midlife female population: an epidemiological study.,"It is a well accepted status that socio-cultural characteristics may affect the onset of menopause and its characteristics. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence rates of menopausal symptoms and these symptoms related factors, and to assess the women's attitudes towards some climacteric issues. This survey was conducted between Jan., 1st 2008 and March, 31st 2008 to research the menopause status of the female population in a city of western Turkey. The study group consisted of 1551 women selected with a multistage area sampling method: a random sample of individuals aged 40-65 years. The questionnaire included questions pertaining to women's sociodemographic characteristics, women's menopausal status, some statements about the climacteric, use of hormones at menopause or before menopause, and some climacteric myths. The data was analyzed by Chi-square (x2) analysis and percent (%) ratios with a significant value of P < 0.05. The mean age of the women was 49.1 years. Over 90% of the women were of the negative opinion that the climacteric is ""the end of youth"", ""the end of fecundity"", and ""the end of unclean days"". Most women said that cessation of menstrual periods was the most positive thing because they do not have to wait for monthly bleedings, use sanitary equipment, or take birth control methods. There were significant connections between age groups and nearly all the items, with the exception of the items ""the end of life"" and ""the end of fecundity"". Among the women, hot flushes were the most common complaint occurring in 96.5% of women: being severe in 32.9%, moderate in 43.1% and mild in 20.4%. This was followed by low backache or muscle pain 95.0% (25.9% severe, 46.0% moderate and mild 23.1%), headache 91.7% (21.9% severe, 34.9% moderate and 34.9% mild) and feeling tired 91.0% (15.3% severe, 38.6% moderate and 37.1% mild). Most of the women in this study had mixed ideas of opinions concerning the climacteric, and the majority was also suffering from climacteric complaints.

"Effects of the Menstrual Cycle and Hormonal Contraceptive Use on Metabolic Outcomes, Strength Performance, and Recovery: A Narrative Review.","The effects of female sex hormones on optimal performance have been increasingly recognized as an important consideration in exercise and sport science research. This narrative review explores the findings of studies evaluating the effects of menstrual cycle phase in eumenorrheic women and the use of hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives and hormonal intrauterine devices) on metabolism, muscular strength, and recovery in active females. Ovarian hormones are known to influence metabolism because estrogen is a master regulator of bioenergetics. Importantly, the menstrual cycle may impact protein synthesis, impacting skeletal muscle quality and strength. Studies investigating muscular strength in eumenorrheic women report equivocal findings between the follicular phase and luteal phase with no differences compared to oral contraceptive users. Studies examining recovery measures (using biomarkers, blood lactate, and blood flow) do not report clear or consistent effects of the impact of the menstrual cycle or hormonal contraception use on recovery. Overall, the current literature may be limited by the evaluation of only one menstrual cycle and the use of group means for statistical significance. Hence, to optimize training and performance in females, regardless of hormonal contraception use, there is a need for future research to quantify the intra-individual impact of the menstrual cycle phases and hormonal contraceptive use in active females.",['Cabre HE; Gould LM; Redman LM; Smith-Ryan AE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39057670,"menstrual cycle phase may influence metabolism, muscular strength, and recovery. hormonal contraception use in active females may influence metabolism."
Women Firefighters' Health and Well-Being: An International Survey.,"This study aimed to identify specific health and well-being issues that women firefighters may experience as part of their daily working practices. Issues identified from this under-represented population can drive future research, education, and strategy to guide safety and health practices. A total of 840 women firefighters from 14 separate countries (255 United Kingdom and Ireland, 320 North America, 177 Australasia, and 88 mainland Europe) completed the survey over a 4-month period. Questions related to general health and well-being and role-specific health concerns, gender-related issues, and available exercise facilities. Women firefighters in North America reported a higher prevalence of lower back (49%) and lower limb (51%) injuries than all other groups. North American respondents reported more heat illnesses (45%) than respondents from other places (36%). Although many participants did not respond, of those who did, 39% thought the menstrual cycle (199/512) or menopause (55/151) affected their work, and 36% were concerned for their ability to meet future job demands. Sixteen percent felt confident they could complete the role after 60 years of age. Women firefighters identified a lack of strength and conditioning support (50%) or lack of gym access (21%). There appears to be poor availability of female-specific personal protective equipment, with availability greatest in the United Kingdom (66%) compared with the sample as a whole (42%). There is a need for female-specific strength and conditioning support and facilities to decrease injury and illness risk and improve longevity. Research and education into gynecological issues, heat exposure, and their effects on women firefighters' fertility and cancer risk is required.",['Watkins ER; Walker A; Mol E; Jahnke S; Richardson AJ'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30930075,"840 women firefighters from 14 separate countries completed the survey over a 4-month period. questions related to general health and well-being and role-specific health concerns, gender-related issues, and available exercise facilities."

Menorrhagia and bleeding disorders in adolescent females.,"In women, von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Since VWD and other inherited bleeding disorders are autosomal disorders, they affect women and men. Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), is the most common symptom of women with bleeding disorder experience. Objectively, it is defined as bleeding that lasts for more than seven days or results in the loss of more than 80 ml of blood per menstrual cycle. The prevalence of menorrhagia in a woman with a bleeding disorder ranges from 32 to 100% in patients with VWD, from 5 to 98% in patients with a platelet dysfunction and from 35 to 70% in women with a rare factor deficiency. A detailed history and a careful physical exam are the first steps towards a diagnosis in adolescents, adding a PBAC>100 increased the sensitivity of the screening tool further to 95%. Laboratory testing should be made at the time of menstrual bleeding in an effort to capture the lowest level of VWF:Ag and FVIII:C. Treatment options for menorrhagia in VWD: (1) antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid, (2) the non-transfusional agent desmopressin (DDAVP), (3) purified blood products that contain factor VIII and VWF concentrated from plasma and (4) hormonal preparations.",['Halimeh S'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22127528,von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. menorrhagia is defined as bleeding that lasts for more than seven days.
Relation and Treatment Approach of Migraine in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.,"Headaches are one of the most frequent reasons people visit the neurology department. In 2019, headache issues ranked as the 14th most common cause of disability-adjusted life years globally. According to the International Headache Society, migraine is a particular type of headache that is unilateral, frequently throbbing, associated with vertigo, and sensitive to light, sound, and head movement. A migraine has four stages: premonitory, aura, headache, and postdrome. Migraine is the type of discomfort that most frequently complicates the pregnancy. A migraine is more common in women than in men. Migraines are influenced by increased levels of estrogen during pregnancy and a sharp decrease in those levels during puerperium. Untreated migraine can result in premature labor, hypertension, and low birth weight babies. Menstrual-related events occurred more frequently in migraine sufferers than in non-migraine sufferers. We have explained the relation of sex hormones that trigger migraine. We have also reviewed the therapeutic approach, such as pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, for migraine in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A migraine episode during menstruation was slightly more severe and complicated than a headache that wasn't a migraine. Breastfeeding is not prohibited by migraines. The steady estrogen levels brought on by lactating women's lack of menstruation may function as a protective factor. In addition to any required drug therapy, nonpharmacological techniques should always be used as the first line of treatment. Preconception counseling is an essential part of providing headache patients with safe therapy during pregnancy. Supplemental estrogen should not be used by any women who have an aura or who are 35 years of age or older because there is inadequate proof to support any long-term adverse effects. Paracetamol is advised for use in acute therapy during pregnancy. Mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy are more likely to have children with hyperkinetic disorders and characteristics resembling attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Menstrual migraine can be treated in a variety of ways, including acute therapy, non-pharmacological therapy, and preconception counseling. Similar tactics are used to treat migraines during pregnancy, but it's important to take the medications' safety rating into account. Migraines and menstrual problems go together. A safeguarding element is a constant estrogen level during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The preferred method of treatment for migraine is non-pharmacological therapy, followed by prenatal counseling. Sumatriptan and acetaminophen are both effective treatments for transient migraine attacks that occur during pregnancy or breastfeeding.",['Turankar T; Sorte A; Wanjari MB; Chakole S; Sawale S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37123778,"migraine issues ranked as the 14th most common cause of disability-adjusted life years globally. migraine is unilateral, frequently throbbing, associated with vertigo. migraine is more common in women than in men."
"COVID-19 pandemic - Cocktail of variants, a study from Northern India.","The aim of the study was to identify and monitor the circulating strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the samples received at our center and update the existing national and international genomic surveillance data. SARS-CoV-2 is no exception to the basic nature of the viruses ability to change and evolve. Since its first report in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, multiple variants of the virus have emerged and been reported. Five variants of concern have been recognized and reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are associated with variable degrees of transmissibility and mortality. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs received in viral transport medium at the Viral Research Diagnostic Laboratory were processed for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for selective positive samples using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology, using MinKNOW software for data acquisition. The clades were assigned using Nextclade v2.4.1 software. The statistical analysis was calculated using OpenEpi version 3, an open-source calculator, and two by two. Variants reported over the study period included Alpha, Kappa, Delta, and Omicron. Delta dominated in the year 2021, while Omicron was the dominant variant in 2022. In both the dominant variants, asymptomatics contributed to around 30-40% of positives. Intensive care unit admissions and mortality were higher in the Delta variant, while vaccination history and travel history were higher in the patients with Omicron variant. The trend tracking of these variants has been important in view of public health, enabling early interventions to control the spread of the disease and foresight in preparation for the situation.",['Chaudhary P; Gulati N; Gupta V; Garg R; Walia S; Dhawan I; Thakur B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39027869,study from northern India. aim of study was to identify and monitor the circulating strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the samples received at our center.

A thematic analysis of the perceptions of reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance as a potential family planning method in the United Kingdom.,"This exploratory study aimed to look into public perceptions of Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance (RISUG) as a family planning method in the United Kingdom (UK). It also aimed to discover if there were any sex differences in perceptions between males and females. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted, six with males and six with females, all residents of the UK. The audio data from the interviews then was transcribed for analysis. An inductive and a semantic thematic analysis was conducted on the data set. Three main themes were constructed, including: (i) RISUG Hesitancy, (ii) Females perceived benefits of RISUG and (iii) Males perceived concerns regarding RISUG. Hesitancy was related to vaccination hesitancy, females wanted males to have more reproductive autonomy and males placed their concerns through the lens of 'other' males that their may be unintended side effects. Together these three themes represent both perceived risk and overall benefits of the method. However, while randomized control trails have been completed to standard for RISUG, males perceived concerns, suggesting a disconnect between the public's perceptions and professionals understanding of trails. RISUG was perceived as a viable option for family planning in the future, however trust of the new contraceptive method will need to be fostered among the public in order to effectively transfer knowledge on the potential side effects and the standard of pre-market testing for these. Effective public health messages can result in better education of people concerning the new contraceptive method, including the risks and benefits. By using perceptions to inform health messages around RISUG, researchers and practitioners can learn from potential users how to best address misinformation or concerns, while at the same time building an evidence base for when new male methods reach the contraceptive market.",['Gheorghe CM; Slack O; Wilson AD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058215,"study aimed to look into public perceptions of reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance. it also aimed to discover if there were any sex differences in perceptions between males and females. twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted, six with males and six with females, all residents of the UK."
Young Men's Attitudes and Understanding of Menstruation.,"To identify sources of information, perceptions, and potential misinformation about menstruation among college-aged men in the United States. This is a mixed-methods cross-sectional survey study of students in the United States. Inclusion criteria included participants aged 17-29 years, male gender identity, enrolled as an undergraduate or graduate student, and no personal history of menstruation. This study included 70 participants. Almost half of all participants (42.9%) first learned about menstruation from family members. More than two-thirds of respondents felt that menstrual education was essential or very important for all genders. The most common symptoms noted to be associated with periods included cramping (93.6%), mood changes (80.9%), and vague ""hormonal"" changes (36.2%). When asked how a menstrual period might affect someone's ability to perform daily activities, one-third reported debilitating or very burdensome symptoms, whereas one-fifth felt periods do not have much impact. Comprehensive education and accurate reproductive health knowledge are critical in combating gender bias and stigma. Most males surveyed agree that education on menstruation is important, yet the majority do not have or do not remember formal education on this topic, instead relying on family members and friends as learning tools and resources. Most participants identified negative symptoms associated with menstrual periods, especially mental health concerns including mood changes and irritability. This association with mood changes, as well as vague ""hormonal fluctuations,"" contributes to the societal bias against people who menstruate by marking them as prone to emotional instability, thereby exacerbating gender prejudices. It is therefore critical that accurate menstrual education be widely available for everyone, regardless of gender.",['Zablock K; Fei YF'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38069935,"study of college-aged men in the united states includes participants aged 17-29. inclusion criteria included male gender identity, enrolled as an undergraduate or graduate student. most common symptoms associated with periods included cramping, mood changes, and vague ""hormonal"" changes."
"Nutritional Strategies for Optimizing Health, Sports Performance, and Recovery for Female Athletes and Other Physically Active Women: A Systematic Review.","Despite the progress toward gender equality in events like the Olympic Games and other institutionalized competitions, and the rising number of women engaging in physical exercise programs, scientific studies focused on establishing specific nutritional recommendations for female athletes and other physically active women are scarce. This systematic review aimed to compile the scientific evidence available for addressing the question ""What dietary strategies, including dietary and supplementation approaches, can improve sports performance, recovery, and health status in female athletes and other physically active women?"" The Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched. The review process involved a comprehensive search strategy using keywords connected by Boolean connectors. Data extracted from the selected studies included information on the number of participants and their characteristics related to sport practice, age, and menstrual function. A total of 71 studies were included in this review: 17 focused on the analysis of dietary manipulation, and 54 focused on the effects of dietary supplementation. The total sample size was 1654 participants (32.5% categorized as competitive athletes, 30.7% as highly/moderately trained, and 37.2% as physically active/recreational athletes). The risk of bias was considered moderate, mainly for reasons such as a lack of access to the study protocol, insufficient description of how the hormonal phase during the menstrual cycle was controlled for, inadequate dietary control during the intervention, or a lack of blinding of the researchers. Diets with high carbohydrate (CHO) content enhance performance in activities that induce muscle glycogen depletion. In addition, pre-exercise meals with a high glycemic index or rich in CHOs increase CHO metabolism. Ingestion of 5-6 protein meals interspersed throughout the day, with each intake exceeding 25 g of protein favors anabolism of muscle proteins.

Failure Rate of Medical Treatment for Miscarriage Correlated with the Difference between Gestational Age According to Last Menstrual Period and Gestational Size Calculated via Ultrasound.,"<b>Objective</b>: To study whether the interval between gestational age calculated using the last menstrual period (GA-LMP) and gestational age calculated via ultrasound (GA-US) is correlated with the success rate of medical treatment in cases of miscarriages. <b>Methods</b>: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a gynecology unit in a tertiary medical center. Women who underwent medical treatment with Misoprostol for miscarriage at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center between 07/2015 and 12/2020 were included. Incomplete or septic miscarriages, multiple pregnancies, patients with irregular periods, and cases of missing data were excluded. Failure of medical treatment was defined as the need for surgical intervention due to a retained gestational sac, severe bleeding or retained products of conception. The cohort study was divided into two groups: patients with successful treatment and patients for whom surgical intervention was eventually needed. We performed both a univariate and multivariate analysis in order to identify whether a correlation between GA-LMP and GA-US interval is indeed a factor in the success rate of a medical abortion. <b>Results</b>: Overall, 778 patients were included in the study. From this cohort 582 (74.9%) had undergone a successful medical treatment, while 196 (25.1%) required surgical intervention due to the failure of medical treatment, as defined above. The GA-LMP to GA-US interval (in weeks) was 2.6 ± 1.4 in the success group, while the GA in the failure group was 3.1 ± 1.6 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). After performing a multivariant regression analysis, we were able to show that the GA-LMP to GA-US interval was found to be independently correlated with an increase in the treatment failure rate (aOR = 1.24, CI 95% (1.01-1.51), <i>p</i> = 0.03). <b>Conclusions</b>: In cases of miscarriage, longer GA-LMP to GA-US interval has been shown to be an independently correlated factor to lower success rate of the medical treatment option.",['Gluck O; Barber E; Friedman M; Feldstein O; Tal O; Grinstein E; Mizrachi Y; Kerner R; Saidian M; Menasherof M; Sagiv R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37834756,failure rate of medical treatment for miscarriage correlated with the difference between gestational age according to last menstrual period and gestational age calculated via ultrasound. women who underwent medical treatment with Misoprostol for miscarriage at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center between 07/2015 and 12/2020 were excluded.

Impact Assessment of Patient Experience Capacity-Building Program Using Kirkpatrick Model for Program Evaluation at a Regional Healthcare System.,"The patient experience (PX) is central to improving the quality of healthcare services. We launched a PX capacity- and capability-building program at the Armed Forces Hospitals Taif Region, which is integral to our regional healthcare cluster transformation plans and is an initial step toward developing a culture of improvement in human experience in healthcare. A multidisciplinary PX committee recruited five frontline interprofessional PX heads, one from each of our regional healthcare hospitals. The Kirkpatrick model for program evaluation was used to assess the impact on four key levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. A pre-program competency assessment was conducted to evaluate the level of expertise across various PX competencies, and a program curriculum was developed accordingly. Participants underwent an intensive workshop-based PX capacity-building training program. A post-program competency assessment was performed along with a post-program survey. The PX-related activities led by interprofessional frontline PX heads at their respective hospitals' post-programs were tracked. The impact on the regional PX mean score across various settings, including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings, was measured using Press Ganey PX surveys. Our work is reported in accordance with the SQUIRE-EDU guidelines of the EQUATOR network. The PX capacity-building program led to a significant improvement in participants' expertise across various PX competencies. Significant improvements beyond the strategic targets were observed in the PX mean score in inpatient departments pre-program (83.31) vs. post-program (86.34), with a <i>p</i>-value of < 0.001 across the regional healthcare system. The PX capacity-building program is a first step toward major cultural change amid the healthcare cluster transformation in our regional healthcare system. The Kirkpatrick model helps evaluate the impact of PX capacity- and capability-building training programs comprehensively through an organizational approach.

"Understanding challenges related to menstrual hygiene management: Knowledge and practices among the adolescent girls in urban slums of Jaipur, India.","This study aimed to determine the factors associated with knowledge and practices related to menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls in urban slums in Jaipur, India. A cross-sectional study among 417 adolescent girls was conducted. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to analyze the data and determine the associated factors. Only 48.7% of girls had a correct understanding of menstruation. In addition, 55.1% of the menstruating girls had faced health problems related to mensuration in the last 6 months; however, only 47.6% visited a health facility for treatment. Educational status of the girl (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.88-4.06), mother's education (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.30-3.67) and income (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.67-3.95), father's income (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.76-2.95), and counseling by field health workers (AOR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.23-3.51) were found to be associated with knowledge about menstruation. Girl's education (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.74-2.95), mother's education (AOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.7-2.84) and income (AOR = 1.314, 95% CI = 0.44-2.02), father's education (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.55-3.08) and income (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.86-3.28), and counseling by field health workers (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 0.76-2.64) were found to be associated with the type of absorbents used. The findings from the study show that the awareness about mensuration and utilization of health services among adolescent girls is low.

Mind the gap: Gender disparities in authorship in the Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences.,"Research studies tracking gender and academic publication productivity in healthcare find gender disparities in research activity, publication, and authorship. Article authorship is one of the important metrics to track when seeking to understand gender inequality in academic career advancement. Research on gender disparities in publication productivity in the field of Medical Radiation Science (MRS) is very limited thus this study analyses and explains potential gender differences in article authorship and acceptance for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences (JMIRS) for a 5-year period (2017-2021). Gender was inferred based on the author's first name or title (e.g., Mr, Mrs or Ms). For those who left the title blank or reported as 'Dr' or 'Prof,' a series of steps were taken to identify their gender. Where gender was impossible to ascribe, these authors were excluded. Descriptive and inferential statistics are reported for the study population. Descriptive and inferential statistics are used. Percentages of females are reported, and males constitute the other portion. Chi-square, slope analysis and z-tests were used to test hypotheses. Results show that female authorship overall and in all categories of authorship placement (i.e., first, last and corresponding) increased over the timeframe reviewed. The percentage gain in the increase was higher than that for male authorship. However, male authorship started from a higher baseline in 2017 and has also increased year on year and overall, as well as in each placement category examined. More female authors were in the MRS sub-specialism Radiation Therapy (RT) than in the other MRS sub-specialisms. Analysis of the acceptance rate of articles with female authors shows a weak downward trend, and this may be related to higher submission and acceptance rates of articles by male authors during the same period. Male authors are overrepresented in all categories, which raises questions about the persistence of gender disparities in JMIRS authorship and article acceptance. Positive trends in female authorship indicate progress, yet there is the persistence of the significant under-representation of women in the Medical Radiation Sciences workforce in academic publishing. Recruiting more males to address the gender imbalance in the profession should not be at the expense of females' career progression.",['Bolderston A; McCuaig C; Ghosh S; McEntee MF; Kiely E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39106559,"research studies tracking gender and academic publication productivity in healthcare find gender disparities in research activity, publication, and authorship. article authorship is one of the important metrics to track when seeking to understand gender inequality in academic career advancement."
A systematic review of community pharmacy interventions to improve peri- and post-menopausal health.,"Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian follicular function. Symptoms include mood disorders, vaginal atrophy, hot flashes and night sweats and can emerge during a gradual transition period called perimenopause. Community pharmacies are well placed to deliver a wide range of healthcare services, including supporting and educating menopausal women; however, to date, no systematic review has assessed the effectiveness of community pharmacy-led interventions in improving peri- and post-menopausal health. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines we evaluated community pharmacy-led interventions that targeted women in peri- or post-menopause. Electronic searches in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library were conducted on 13th February 2023. Additionally, we examined the included studies references and citation lists using Google Scholar. A total of 915 articles were identified and screened against the inclusion criteria. Two studies were included; one identified post-menopausal women at risk of developing osteoporosis (OP), and one evaluated the outcomes of a community pharmacy-based menopause education programme. Study one found 11 (11%) post-menopausal women were at risk of developing OP based on quantitative ultrasound screening offered by community pharmacists and referred to their physician. Study two reported that women had access to adequate personalised menopause counselling and increased knowledge of menopause topics because of the educational programme within community pharmacies. Both studies were of low quality. The lack of included studies reflects the need for high-quality research to determine whether community pharmacy-led interventions are feasible, effective and acceptable, to improve health outcomes of peri- or post-menopausal women.",['Chow H; Righton O; Berry H; Bell Z; Flynn AC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38185857,systematic review of community pharmacy interventions. no systematic review has assessed effectiveness of community pharmacy-led interventions. menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian follicular function.
Exploring the potential impact of adding upper limit single trigger MET thresholds to a paediatric early warning scoring tool at a tertiary children's hospital: a retrospective review.,"This study aims to determine the impact of incorporating upper threshold vital sign triggers into the digital Children's Early Warning Tool (CEWT) on the number of medical emergency team (MET) alerts. De-identified vital set data from the Cerner Millennium Integrated Electronic Medical Records were obtained for all paediatric patients aged ≤16 years at a tertiary children's hospital in Brisbane over a 12-month period in 2022. Patients in the paediatric intensive care unit, post-anaesthetic care unit, or the emergency department were excluded as they would not trigger MET alerts in these locations. Microsoft Excel scripts were used to tabulate and graph the data to compare the number of MET alerts in the current system vs. the system with proposed upper thresholds for heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and severe respiratory distress. A total of 389,352 vital sets were used for analysis after exclusions. Total cumulative MET alerts increased by 229% from 1,707 to 5,623. The number of increased alerts was inversely proportional to the age group. Respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure were the vital signs most associated with increased alerts. The largest number of new alerts came from patients with lower CEWT scores, while the largest proportional increase in alerts came from those with higher CEWT scores. Incorporating upper threshold vital sign triggers into the digital CEWT leads to a substantial increase in MET alerts. The consequent workload is not justified, given the lack of evidence suggesting a failure of the current CEWT system in recognising deteriorating patients.",['Steckle S; Fowler C; Campbell V'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39035465,"a retrospective review of the impact of incorporating upper threshold vital sign triggers into the digital Children's Early Warning Tool (CEWT) on the number of medical emergency team (MET) alerts. a total of 389,352 vital sets were used for analysis after exclusions."
Nondaily hormonal contraception: considerations in contraceptive choice and patient counseling.,"To review currently available choices for non-daily hormonal contraception, considering efficacy, safety, patient counseling issues, and appropriate patient selection. Worldwide medical literature and the individual products' prescribing information. Patients and clinicians have many nondaily hormonal contraceptive options available--from Depo-Provera quarterly injection, which has been available in the United States for over 10 years, to several new entries (Mirena 5-year intrauterine system, Lunelle monthly injection, NuvaRing monthly intravaginal ring, and Ortho Evra weekly transdermal patch). All these options offer high efficacy and enhanced convenience for many patients over daily oral contraceptives (OCs). Barriers to use of these agents may include patients' lack of information as well as fear or misconceptions regarding the hormones and methods. All of these can be addressed with adequate patient counseling and open dialogue. The clinician and patient need to be well-informed regarding these options so that they can work together and identify the best contraceptive fit for the patient---with the ultimate goal being to increase patient satisfaction and adherence and, thus, avoid unintended pregnancy. Despite the efficacy of OCs, missed pills are quite common and contribute to unintended pregnancy. Many women in all population categories would benefit from the convenience and reliability of nondaily hormonal contraceptives. The highest efficacy rates with typical use are associated with agents that require minimal user participation (i.e., Depo-Provera, Mirena). Compared to daily regimens, all nondaily options offer increased convenience and may contribute to improved patient adherence. However, barriers to use may exist. Patient fears regarding use of hormones can be minimized by discussing the long-term safety of hormonal contraceptives. (The data are predominantly derived from Depo-Provera and OCs because these agents have been available in the United States and in the rest of the world for much longer than the newer nondaily options.) Patient counseling and appropriate expectations regarding changes in menstrual pattern have been demonstrated to further enhance patient adherence to therapy. Finally, patient lifestyle preferences must be considered. The finding that many women are comfortable with or even prefer amenorrhea, which is associated with options such as Depo-Provera, highlights how important it is for clinicians to avoid making assumptions about a patient's contraceptive preferences. Rather, clinicians and patients should exchange information through an open dialogue. For the majority of patients, nondaily hormonal contraceptives should be considered and offered as first-line options.",['Freeman S'],2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15264608,nondaily hormonal contraception is considered a consideration in contraceptive choice. the highest efficacy rates with typical use are associated with agents that require minimal user participation.
Menstruation-related symptoms are associated with physical activity and midpoint of sleep: a pilot study.,"Menstruation-related symptoms (MRSs) significantly impact women's health and contribute to economic burdens worldwide. Current interventions, primarily pharmacological ones, have limitations and side effects that underscore the need for alternative management strategies. This study explores the association between MRSs and lifestyle factors, specifically physical activity and sleep timing across menstrual cycle phases, to inform non-pharmacological intervention development. Fourteen female students from Ritsumeikan University, Japan, with regular menstrual cycles (25-38 days), not on hormonal treatment or engaged in shift work, participated in this observational study. Using a Fitbit Inspire 2, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and sleep timing were monitored over a complete cycle. Menstrual cycle phases were defined based on ovulation day, predicted using home luteinizing hormone tests. Participants completed daily electronic questionnaires rating MRSs using a modified menstrual distress questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with a gamma distribution and logarithmic link function, examining the relationship of TDEE and the midpoint of sleep time (MS time) with MRS severity. The following observations were noted: first, MRS severity, except for behavioral change symptoms, significantly increased during the menstrual and luteal phases compared to the follicular phase. Second, delayed MS time was associated with reduced pain, concentration symptoms, water retention, and negative affect during the menstrual phase and reduced negative affect during the luteal phase. Finally, an increase in TDEE was associated with reduced concentration symptoms, autonomic reaction symptoms, and negative affect during the menstrual and luteal phases and reduced water retention only during the luteal phase. This study provides insights into the relationship between MRSs and TDEE/MS time, suggesting potential non-therapeutic approaches for symptom management, though further research is needed to substantiate these findings for practical applications.",['Masuda H; Okada S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38179154,"study explores association between MRSs and lifestyle factors. study was carried out by fourteen women from Ritsumeikan university, japan."
Obstetric and gynecologic challenges in women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"To determine how often women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience obstetric and gynecologic issues both compared with the general population and within the three most common subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. An anonymous, prospective, online questionnaire in English was posted to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation web site (http://ednf.org). Of the 1,769 of those who completed the survey, 1,225 reported a typed diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Further stratification to the three most common types and reproductive-aged women (n=775) allowed conclusions to be made about differences in rates of obstetric complications and gynecologic dysfunction compared with the general population and between types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Rates of obstetric outcomes for women who reported at least one pregnancy included term pregnancy in 69.7%, preterm birth in 25.2%, spontaneous abortion in 57.2%, and ectopic pregnancy in 5.1%. Infertility was reported by 44.1% of survey respondents. Normal menstrual cycles were reported by only 32.8% with intermenstrual bleeding occurring in 18.6%. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported by 32.9% survey participants. Gynecologic pain reported included dysmenorrhea by 92.5% and dyspareunia by 77.0%. There is a much greater prevalence of obstetric and gynecologic issues reported by women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome than in the general population. Additionally, rates differed significantly among the three most common types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with vascular type having the highest rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and menstrual abnormalities. Physician providers should be aware of these challenges and should counsel patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome about relevant options and risks.",['Hurst BS; Lange SS; Kullstam SM; Usadi RS; Matthews ML; Marshburn PB; Templin MA; Merriam KS'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24499752,"anonymous questionnaire posted to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation web site. 1,225 of those who completed the survey reported typed diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
Bibliometric and scientometric analysis of PSMA-targeted radiotheranostics: knowledge mapping and global standing.,"Bibliometric and scientometric analyses provide a structured approach to large amounts of data, enabling the prediction of research theme trends over time, the detection of shifts in the boundaries of disciplines, and the identification of the most productive countries, institutions and scholars. In the context of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiotheranostics, no bibliometric or scientometric analysis has been published thus far. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify key contributors to the literature, assess the global scientific production of related research, and possibly predict future development patterns. Scientometrics and bibliometrics were utilized to analyze the current body of knowledge while tracking its evolution to support scientific decision-making comprehensively and systematically. Science mapping techniques were employed to visualize research activities. Two different tools, Tableau and VOSviewer, were utilized, with VOSviewer being deemed the most suitable for the research objectives. The Web of Science (WoS) was used as the principal database for the searches. Through the search process over a period of 30 years (January 1993-January 2023), 694 original studies in the English language were subjected to comprehensive analysis. By employing bibliometric and scientometric methods, multiple networks were created that mapped various concepts, such as publication trends, leading countries, cocitations, coauthorship among researchers and scientists, as well as coauthorship among organizations and funding agencies. This study revealed the evolutionary patterns, trends, outliers, and key players in the PSMA field, which enabled a more nuanced understanding of the research landscape. This research contributes to the enrichment of knowledge on PSMA-targeted radiotheranostics through detailed global bibliometric and scientometric analyses. It stresses the necessity for the development of communication platforms, the establishment of supportive infrastructures, and the implementation of proactive solutions to address emerging challenges. This study offers a significant resource for delineating effective strategies and identifying prominent funding bodies essential for continuous advancements in the field of PSMA-based diagnosis and therapy for prostate cancer. It is vital to sustain this momentum to ensure further progress in this pioneering area.",['Sallam M; Mohammadi M; Sainsbury F; Nguyen NT; Kimizuka N; Muyldermans S; Benešová-Schäfer M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39011478,bibliometric and scientometric analyses provide a structured approach to large amounts of data. bibliometrics and scientometric analyses provide a structured approach to large amounts of data. bibliometrics and bibliometrics were used to analyze the current body of knowledge while tracking its evolution to support scientific decision-making comprehensively and systematically.
"Attentional, anticipatory and spatial cognition fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle: Potential implications for female sport.","Current research suggests that menstruating female athletes might be at greater risk of musculoskeletal injury in relation to hormonal changes throughout the menstrual cycle. A separate body of work suggests that spatial cognition might also fluctuate in a similar manner. Changes in spatial cognition could, in theory, be a contributing risk factor for injury, especially in fast-paced sports that require precise, millisecond accuracy in interactions with moving objects in the environment. However, existing theories surrounding causes for increased injury risk in menstruating females largely focus on biomechanical mechanisms, with little consideration of possible cognitive determinants of injury risk. Therefore, the aim of this proof-of-principle study was to explore whether menstruating females exhibit fluctuations in cognitive processes throughout their cycle on a novel sport-oriented cognitive test battery, designed to measure some of the mental processes putatively involved in these sporting situations. A total of 394 participants completed an online cognitive battery, a mood scale and a symptom questionnaire twice, 14 days apart. After exclusions, 248 eligible participants were included in the analyses (mean: 28 ± 6 years) (male = 96, female(menstruating) = 105, female(contraception) = 47). Cycle phase for menstruating females was based on self-reported information. The cognitive battery was designed to measure reaction times, attention, visuospatial functions (including 3D mental rotation) and timing anticipation. Three composite scores were generated using factor analysis with varimax rotation (Errors, Reaction Time, Intra-Individual Variability). Mixed model ANOVAs and repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to test for between and within-subject effects. There was no group difference in reaction times and accuracy between males and females (using contraception and not). However, within subject analyses revealed that regularly menstruating females performed better during menstruation compared to being in any other phase, with faster reaction times (10ms c.ca, p < 0.01), fewer errors (p < 0.05) and lower dispersion intra-individual variability (p < 0.05). In contrast they exhibited slower reaction times (10ms c.ca, p < 0.01) and poorer timing anticipation (p < 0.01) in the luteal phase, and more errors in the predicted ovulatory phase (p < 0.01). Self-reported mood, cognitive and physical symptoms were all worst during menstruation (p < 0.01), and a significant proportion of females felt that their symptoms were negatively affecting their cognitive performance during menstruation on testing day, which was incongruent with their actual performance. These findings suggest that visuospatial and anticipatory processes may fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle in the general population, with better performance during the menstrual phase and poorer performance during the luteal phase. If these extend to associations between phase-specific cognitive performance and injury incidence, they would support a cognitive theory of determinants of injury risk in cycling female athletes, opening an opportunity to develop mitigation strategies where appropriate.",['Ronca F; Blodgett JM; Bruinvels G; Lowery M; Raviraj M; Sandhar G; Symeonides N; Jones C; Loosemore M; Burgess PW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38762068,study aims to explore whether menstruating female athletes exhibit fluctuations in cognitive processes throughout their cycle. study was designed to measure some of the mental processes putatively involved in these sporting situations.
Are menstrual disturbances associated with an energy availability threshold? A critical review of the evidence.,"Exercising women have a high prevalence of menstrual disturbances. In 2003, it was suggested that disruption in luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility occurs below a threshold of energy availability (EA) of 30 kcal/kg lean body mass (LBM)/day. This paper is a critical review of the evidence regarding the theory that disruptions to the reproductive axis and menstrual disturbances occur below the proposed threshold. Short-term laboratory studies demonstrated that 4-5 days of an EA below 30 kcal/kg LBM/day, induced with or without exercise, decreased serum triiodothyronine and LH pulse frequency, and increased LH pulse amplitude in sedentary, regularly menstruating women. Fewer studies have investigated downstream ovarian effects after long-term exposure to low EA. The Sargent Camp Study was the first randomized trial that induced luteal phase defects, delayed menses, and anovulation by causing weight loss (-4 ± 0.3 kg) with an abrupt increase in exercise volume for two menstrual cycles. The BioEnergetics Study was a randomized controlled trial that induced varying levels of energy deficits by manipulating energy intake and expenditure for three menstrual cycles. LH pulse frequency and triiodothyronine decreased, and 57% of women developed luteal phase defects, anovulation, and/or oligomenorrhea. An EA below 30 kcal/kg fat free mass/day increased the chance of experiencing a menstrual disturbance by 50%. However, menstrual disturbances were observed above and below that EA threshold, and changes in LH pulse frequency predicted only luteal phase defects, not oligomenorrhea or anovulation. The proposed EA threshold is not a cut-off below which menstrual disturbances occur, but represents an increased risk of experiencing menstrual disturbances.",['Salamunes ACC; Williams NI; De Souza MJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38194640,"a critical review of the evidence regarding the theory that disruptions to the reproductive axis and menstrual disturbances occur below the proposed threshold. the study was the first randomized controlled trial that induced luteal phase defects, delayed menses, and anovulation."
Examining the Long-Term Impacts of Ergot Alkaloids on Fetal Heifer Development and Subsequent Growth and Reproductive Performance.,"Consumption of toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue results in poor reproductive performance in domestic livestock. In this study, the objective was to evaluate the effects of ergovaline exposure during mid-gestation (days 93 through 188 of gestation) on dam performance, the growing female fetus, and the subsequent growth and reproductive performance of the gestationally-exposed heifer calves. Pregnant Angus and Simmental-Angus cows were blocked by age (2 - 3, 4 - 7, and > 7 y), body weight (BW), and breed; and then randomly assigned to graze either novel (EN; <5% infection rate; n = 27 Year 1, n = 16 Year 2) or toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue (EI; 99% infection rate; n = 27 Year 1, n = 17 Year 2). Weekly BW, body condition scores (BCS), hair coat scores (HCS), hair shedding scores (HSS), and blood samples for progesterone (P4) analysis were collected from mid-April through July of 2017 (Year 1) and 2018 (Year 2). Gestation length, birth weight, placental characteristics, heifer calf growth, onset of puberty, ovarian characteristics, and artificial insemination (AI) pregnancy rates were measured. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Cows grazing EI pastures had reduced ADG, reduced BCS, greater HSS, and decreased P4 concentrations compared to cows on EN pasture (P < 0.01). Birth weights were decreased for heifers whose dams were exposed to EI pastures during their second trimester (P < 0.01). Heifer pregnancy rates were not impacted by EI pasture exposure during gestation for either year of the study.

Measuring the effectiveness of communication programming on menstrual health and hygiene management (MHM) social norms among adolescent girls in India.,"This manuscript has two objectives: (1) operationalise and measure the fit of two theory-based measures of social norms and (2) examine the relationship between a social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) initiative, social norms, and menstrual health and hygiene management (MHM) among rural adolescent girls in Uttar Pradesh, India. A population-based, case-comparison design was utilised. Interviews were conducted (<i>n</i> = 2212) using quantitative questionnaires. Social norms were operationalised in two ways: (1) a composite additive measure of self-approval, perception of other girls' approval and perception of other girls' practice of the desired MHM behaviour; (2) based on social restrictions. The composite measure had a better model fit, suggesting that social norms should be examined as a multi-dimensional construct with a two-way relationship between personal beliefs and injunctive and descriptive norms. Bivariate and multivariate analysis assessed the relationship between the SBCC intervention, social norms, and adequate MHM. Adolescent girls in the intervention group had more positive social norms (43.99% versus 21.11%) and those reporting positive social norms had 1.66 (95% CI: 1.33-2.09) times greater odds of being in the 'high' MHM practice group, indicating that SBCC interventions promoting positive social norms can impact practice of MHM.",['Sood S; Kostizak K; Ramaiya A; Cronin C'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32991253,"social norms were operationalised in two ways. a population-based, case-comparison design was utilised."
"Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding menstruation and menstrual hygiene among early-reproductive aged women in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional survey.","Poor menstrual hygiene practices during menstruation increases the risk of reproductive tract infections, absenteeism, and negative impact on school performance. Despite being a global problem, there is a lack of knowledge and misconceptions about menstrual hygiene among women of all ages, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. The study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward menstrual hygiene among early reproductive-aged women in Bangladesh to help policymakers and planners take effective initiatives. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and December 2022 in Dhaka, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Sylhet, and Barisal regions of Bangladesh. A convenience sampling technique was utilized to recruit a total of 1,214 participants (100% female; mean age: 22.87 ± 2.64 years). A semi-structured questionnaire including informed consent, socio-demographic information, as well as questions regarding knowledge (6-item), attitudes (7-item), and practices (6-item) toward menstruation and menstrual hygiene practices, was used to conduct the survey. All analyses were performed using the STATA (Version 15.0) and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 25.0). The mean scores of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 4.9 ± 1.51 (out of 6), 12.58 ± 1.58 (out of 14), and 8.80 ± 1.87 (out of 12), respectively. The higher scores of knowledge, attitudes, and practices were significantly associated with several socio-demographic and menstruation-related factors (education, family type, type of menstruation, duration of menstruation, etc.). This study identified several key factors associated with improved knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to menstrual hygiene, including higher education levels, student status, younger age, non-alcohol consumption, and regular menstrual cycles. To enhance menstrual hygiene practices among women, it is crucial to implement targeted interventions that address knowledge disparities and tackle social and environmental influences.",['Siddique AB; Deb Nath S; Mubarak M; Akter A; Mehrin S; Hkatun MJ; Parvine Liza A; Amin MZ'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38089036,"poor menstrual hygiene practices during menstruation increases the risk of reproductive tract infections, absenteeism, and negative impact on school performance. despite being a global problem, there is a lack of knowledge and misconceptions about menstrual hygiene among women of all ages."
Microwave endometrial ablation: development and clinical application.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem. Hysterectomy has been the standard treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding who have not responded to medical treatment. Minimally invasive procedures to destroy the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) are alternatives to hysterectomy. They involve destroying the endometrium using lasers, radiofrequency waves, electrocautery, microwaves, heated saline, or a heated balloon. Microwave endometrial ablation (MEA) is one of these minimally invasive procedures. In this Chapter, use of microwave MEA in the management of heavy menstrual bleeding is described. MEA was developed in Bath, UK in the mid 1990s. MEA is a second-generation method of EA, which involves the use of microwaves at a fixed frequency of 9.2 GHz to destroy the endometrial lining. Initial results for MEA were encouraging, with active treatment times of less than three minutes and high satisfaction rates. Recent studies also showed an equivalent outcome with regards to patients' satisfaction and health-related quality-of-life issues. The procedure, indications, contraindications, principles of operation, potential risks, results, and patient-satisfaction is described herein.",['Downes E; Yasmin R; Flemming R'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17429782,"hysterectomy is the standard treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding who have not responded to medical treatment. hysterectomy is a method of destroying the endometrium using lasers, radiofrequency waves, electrocautery, microwaves, heated saline, or a heated balloon."
"Options for Prevention and Management of Menstrual Bleeding in Adolescent Patients Undergoing Cancer Treatment: ACOG Committee Opinion, Number 817.","Obstetrician-gynecologists frequently are consulted either before the initiation of cancer treatment to request menstrual suppression or during an episode of severe heavy bleeding to stop bleeding emergently. Adolescents presenting emergently with severe uterine bleeding usually require only medical management; surgical management rarely is required. Surgical management should be considered for patients who are not clinically stable, or for those whose conditions are not suitable for medical management or have failed to respond appropriately to medical management. When used continuously, combined hormonal contraceptives are effective for producing amenorrhea, although complete amenorrhea cannot be guaranteed. The risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer is compounded by multiple factors, including presence of metastatic or fast-growing, biologically aggressive cancers; hematologic cancers; treatment-related factors such as surgery or central venous catheters; and the number and type of comorbid conditions. Although as a group, patients undergoing cancer treatment are at elevated risk of venous thromboembolism compared with the general population, this risk may be extremely elevated for certain patients and existing guidance on risk stratification should be consulted. The decision to use estrogen in patients with cancer should be tailored to the individual patient after collaborative consideration of the risk-benefit ratio with the patient and the health care team; the patient should be closely monitored for known adverse effects such as liver toxicity and venous thromboembolism.",[''],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33399429,adolescents presenting emergently with severe uterine bleeding usually require only medical management. surgical management should be considered for patients who are not clinically stable. venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer is compound by multiple factors.
Endometrial biopsy performed before the first in vitro fertilization does not impact the early pregnancy rate.,"Endometrial biopsy (EB) has been showed to increase the rate of clinical pregnancy in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) failures. The purpose of this work was to assess the impact of an EB performed before the first in IVF on the early pregnancy rate. Be One study is a prospective, single-centre, randomized, open-label study. In this parallel study, patients were evenly split into two groups. In one group, patients underwent an EB between days 17 and 22 of the menstrual cycle that precedes the ovarian stimulation. In the other group (control), no EB was performed. The hCG-positive rate (early pregnancy rate) was evaluated on day 14 after the ovarian puncture. In total, 157 patients were randomized in the EB group and 154 patients were in the control group. The early pregnancy rate was 33.1% (52/157) in the EB group and 29.9% (46/154) in the control group (p = 0.54). Other parameters, including perforation, endometritis, or pain level were reassuring. An EB performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle preceding the stimulation of the first IVF did not increase early pregnancy rate.",['Cellier M; Werlen S; Lionel M; Genod A; Felloni B; Semay T; Trombert B; Chauleur C; Raia-Barjat T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38212636,endometrial biopsy performed before first in vitro fertilization does not affect early pregnancy rate. the results of this work were to assess the impact of an EB performed before the first in vitro fertilization.
Knowledge and Attitude of Adolescent Girls and Their Mothers Regarding Cervical Cancer: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.,"Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in India. The mother's awareness about the symptoms and risk factors has a large impact on the daughter's knowledge and attitude. Mother and adolescent daughter duos were selected as the sample as they are the target population at risk for suffering from carcinoma cervix. Mothers are the prime information providers and in an excellent position to aware their adolescent daughters about cervical cancer. The aim of this study is to determine knowledge and attitude of adolescent girls and their mothers regarding cervical cancer and to find the association between the education of the mothers and their knowledge about risk factors. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 duos of adolescent daughters along with their mothers residing in Balmiki Basti (Delhi), using a predesigned, pretested, semi-structured interview schedule. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-22 version. Only 61% of mothers and 52% of daughters have heard about cervical cancer. Inter-menstrual bleeding was the most common symptom recognized by the mother (50%) and daughter (44%) duos followed by postmenopausal bleeding (47% of mothers and 33% of daughters). Most common risk factors recognized by mothers and their daughters were promiscuity and tobacco and smoking. About 81% of mothers and 68% of daughters have a positive attitude toward internal examination by a gynecologist at least once in 3 years. Human papillomavirus infection was recognized as a risk factor by 13 among which 8 were educated till graduation (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with endometriosis in Ukraine: results a multicenter study.,"Aim: To estimate pregnancy outcomes associated with endometriosis in Ukraine. Materials and Methods: We performed the multicentre prospective cohort study during the period from January 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2021. The study included pregnant women aged ≥18 years hospitalized in 17 hospitals from 15 regions of Ukraine. Logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of the 27,558 women, 990 (3,6%) reported a diagnosis of endometriosis before pregnancy. In 990 deliveries, women with endometriosis had a higher risk of hypertension in pregnancy (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.3), preeclampsia (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5), severe preeclampsia (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.3), hemorrhage in pregnancy (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.0-2.5), placental abruption (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.3), placenta previa (OR 3.9, 95% CI 3.5-4.3), premature rupture of membranes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.8), and retained placenta (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.6). The neonates had increased risks of preterm birth before 28 weeks (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.7-3.6), birth before 34 weeks (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.8-3.6), being small for gestational age (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6), being diagnosed with congenital malformations (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.3-1.4), and neonatal death (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.1).

The cytokine profile of menstrual blood.,"The menstrual cycle is regulated by a complex interplay between endometrial epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and sex hormones. To communicate, cells secrete cytokines that have multiple and diverse effects on recipient cells. Knowledge of how these cells interact in the uterus is insufficient. Menstrual blood is easily accessible and provides a source to study menstrual cycle physiology. This study aimed to determine the cytokine profile in menstrual blood plasma and investigate the differences in cytokine profiles between menstrual and peripheral blood plasma. Several previous studies indicate an improved chance of embryo implantation after endometrial scratching. Consequently, our secondary aim was to compare the menstrual blood cytokine profile before and after luteal phase endometrial scratching. Nineteen healthy donors collected menstrual blood for the first 24 hours of menstruation in two sequential cycles. Matched peripheral blood was taken at the same time. An endometrial biopsy was performed at cycle day 7-9 post ovulation in between the two collection times. A Luminex multiplex assay was performed in one batch analyzing a predetermined group of cytokines in plasma. Peripheral blood plasma and menstrual blood plasma showed substantial significant differences in cytokine profile. In menstrual blood plasma, C5/C5a, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and CXCL8 were detected in high concentrations, whereas IL-2, IL-12p70, XCL1/Lymphotactin, and interferon-γ were low. The most pronounced median differences between menstrual and peripheral blood plasma were found for IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL8. The cytokine profiles of menstrual blood plasma were similar between the individual donors and did not differ over two subsequent cycles. None of the cytokines analyzed in menstrual blood plasma differed significantly before or after luteal phase endometrial scratching (P < .01). Our results demonstrate that the menstrual blood cytokine profile is distinctly different from peripheral blood plasma and that the inter-individual difference in menstrual blood cytokine profile in healthy donors is limited and stable over time. The small injury caused by an endometrial biopsy does not change the cytokine profile in the subsequent menstrual cycle. Our study provides new insights into menstrual cycle physiology.",['Crona Guterstam Y; Strunz B; Ivarsson MA; Zimmer C; Melin AS; Jonasson AF; Björkström NK; Gidlöf SB'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32892344,menstrual blood is easily accessible and provides a source to study menstrual cycle physiology. study aimed to determine the cytokine profile in menstrual blood plasma.
Menstrual hygiene practice among adolescent girls in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Adolescent girls face several challenges relating to menstruation and its proper management. Lack of adequate sanitary products, inadequate water supply, and privacy for changing sanitary pads continue to leave adolescent girls with limited options for safe and proper menstrual hygiene in many low-income settings, including Ethiopia. These situations are also compounded by societal myths, stigmas surrounding menstruation, and discriminatory social norms. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled proportion of safe menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls in Ethiopia using the available studies. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, African Journal Online (AJOL), Hinari, Science Direct, ProQuest, Direct of Open Access Journals, POPLINE, and Cochrane Library database inception to May 31, 2021. Studies reporting the proportion of menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls in Ethiopia were considered. The Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 tests were used to assess the heterogeneity of the included studies. Since the included studies revealed considerable heterogeneity, a random effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of menstrual hygiene management (MHM). Of 1,045 identified articles, 22 studies were eligible for analysis (n = 12,330 participants). The pooled proportion (PP) of safe MHM in Ethiopia was 52.69% (95%CI: 44.16, 61.22). The use of commercial menstrual absorbents was common 64.63% (95%CI: 55.32, 73.93, I2 99.2%) followed by homemade cloth 53.03% (95%CI: 22.29, 83.77, I2 99.2%). Disposal of absorbent material into the latrine was the most common practice in Ethiopia 62.18% (95%CI: 52.87, 71.49, I2 98.7%). One in four girls reported missing one or more school days during menstruation (PP: 32.03%, 95%CI: 22.65%, 41.40%, I2 98.2%). This study revealed that only half of the adolescent girls in Ethiopia had safe MHM practices. To ensure that girls in Ethiopia can manage menstruation hygienically and with dignity, strong gender-specific water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities along with strong awareness creation activities at every level are needed.",['Sahiledengle B; Atlaw D; Kumie A; Tekalegn Y; Woldeyohannes D; Agho KE'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982805,"systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate pooled proportion of safe menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls in Ethiopia using the available studies. of 1,045 identified articles, 22 studies were eligible for analysis (n = 12,330 participants)"
Luteal phase support of intramuscular progesterone associated with lower hypertensive disorders of pregnancy as compared to vaginal progesterone: A cohort study.,"To compare the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) risk between vaginal and intramuscular (IM) progesterone in programmed frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital, and only women who achieved ongoing pregnancy after programmed FET between January 2018 and June 2022 were included. Women with chronic hypertension before pregnancy or with history of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies were excluded. All women were divided into IM progesterone or vaginal progesterone groups according to the route of progesterone supplementation. Follow-up information on obstetric complications and neonatal outcomes were obtained by telephonic interviews. The primary outcome was HDP. Association between routes of progesterone supplementation and HDP was assessed by subgroup analysis and multivariable logistic regression. A total of 5891 programmed FET cycles (3196 IM progesterone cycles and 2695 vaginal progesterone cycles) were included in the analysis. The prevalence of HDP in the IM progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the vaginal progesterone group (6.54% vs 9.17%, P < 0.001). Therein, the prevalence of gestational hypertension (3.57% vs 4.94%, P = 0.009) and pre-eclampsia (2.97% vs 4.23%, P = 0.009) in the IM progesterone group were all significantly lower as compared to the vaginal progesterone group. According to subgroup analysis, IM progesterone was associated with lower HDP risk in all subgroups. The logistic regression analysis showed that the IM progesterone cycles were associated with lower risk of HDP compared to vaginal progesterone cycles (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.80, P < 0.001). Among women undergoing programmed FET cycles, progesterone supplementation with IM progesterone was associated with reduced HDP risk compared to vaginal progesterone.",['Li N; Fan L; Cai H; Pan D; Shi W; Shi J; Wang H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38217105,intramuscular progesterone associated with lower hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared to vaginal progesterone. a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. only women who achieved ongoing pregnancy after programmed FET between January 2018 and June 2022 were excluded.
Luteal phase sertraline treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): Effects on markers of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation and inflammation.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is characterized by severe affective symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. There is some evidence of altered interactions between the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axes in PMDD. There is also evidence that similar affective disorders such as major depression and perinatal depression are associated with dysregulation in immune factors, but this has not been characterized in PMDD. The goals of this exploratory study were to identify 1) whether HPA-HPG axis interactions and immune markers differ between PMDD patients and controls across the menstrual cycle; 2) how luteal phase sertraline treatment impacts stress and inflammatory markers. Participants were females age 18-50 with regular menstrual cycles, not using psychotropic or hormonal medications, and were assigned to a control group or PMDD group based on prospective daily symptom ratings and clinical interview. Blood was drawn in the follicular and luteal phases, during laboratory sessions involving a mildly stressful task. In a second luteal phase, PMDD participants received open-label sertraline (50 mg/d) from ovulation to menses. Serum cortisol and ACTH were measured via ELISA and operationalized as area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg), and peak level following laboratory task. Serum TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL-8, and IL-1β were measured using multiplex kits. Serum allopregnanolone (ALLO) was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. To characterize HPA-HPG axis interactions across the menstrual cycle in PMDD participants and controls, multilevel linear models predicted cortisol and ACTH from the interaction of cycle phase (controlling for sertraline treatment), ALLO, and group. To determine the effects of sertraline treatment on inflammatory markers and how groups might differ in cyclical change on each marker, multilevel linear models predicted inflammatory markers from cycle phase (controlling for sertraline treatment) and group. A final set of exploratory models tested whether inflammatory markers predict premenstrual symptom score severity. The sample included n=77 participants (41 controls, 36 PMDD); 28 participants with PMDD completed sertraline treatment. Group x phase x ALLO interactions showed that higher ALLO levels predicted lower cortisol peak in the treated luteal phase (interaction between phase and ALLO, p=0.042), and there was a higher cortisol peak in the treated luteal phase than the untreated luteal phase (p=0.038). CXCL-8 was significantly associated with premenstrual symptom severity after controlling for group and cycle phase (p=0.011). There were no main effects of group, phase, or ALLO on cortisol AUCg, ACTH AUCg, IL-6, CXCL-8, IL-1β, nor TNF-α (p's>0.05). Serum markers of HPA axis and immune function did not vary by menstrual cycle phase nor PMDD status. However, sertraline treatment in the luteal phase was associated with higher ALLO levels predicting lower cortisol peak in response to mild laboratory stress, suggesting that sertraline treatment may normalize HPG-HPA axis interactions among individuals with PMDD. Greater premenstrual symptomatology was associated with higher levels of the inflammatory marker CXCL-8, but further research is needed into the potential role of inflammation in PMDD.",['Barone JC; Ho A; Osborne LM; Eisenlohr-Moul TA; Morrow AL; Payne JL; Epperson CN; Hantsoo L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096755,premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is characterized by severe affective symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. there is some evidence of altered interactions between the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axes in PMDD.
"Association between menstrual cycle phase and metabolites in healthy, regularly menstruating women in UK Biobank, and effect modification by inflammatory markers and risk factors for metabolic disease.","Preliminary evidence demonstrates some parameters of metabolic control, including glycaemic control, lipid control and insulin resistance, vary across the menstrual cycle. However, the literature is inconsistent, and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the association between the menstrual cycle phase and metabolites and to explore potential mediators and moderators of these associations. We undertook a cross-sectional cohort study using UK Biobank. The outcome variables were glucose; triglyceride; triglyceride to glucose index (TyG index); total, HDL and LDL cholesterol; and total to HDL cholesterol ratio. Generalised additive models (GAM) were used to investigate non-linear associations between the menstrual cycle phase and outcome variables. Anthropometric, lifestyle, fitness and inflammatory markers were explored as potential mediators and moderators of the associations between the menstrual cycle phase and outcome variables. Data from 8694 regularly menstruating women in UK Biobank were analysed. Non-linear associations were observed between the menstrual cycle phase and total (p < 0.001), HDL (p < 0.001), LDL (p = 0.012) and total to HDL cholesterol (p < 0.001), but not glucose (p = 0.072), triglyceride (p = 0.066) or TyG index (p = 0.100). Neither anthropometric, physical fitness, physical activity, nor inflammatory markers mediated the associations between the menstrual cycle phase and metabolites. Moderator analysis demonstrated a greater magnitude of variation for all metabolites across the menstrual cycle in the highest and lowest two quartiles of fat mass and physical activity, respectively. Cholesterol profiles exhibit a non-linear relationship with the menstrual cycle phase. Physical activity, anthropometric and fitness variables moderate the associations between the menstrual cycle phase and metabolite concentration. These findings indicate the potential importance of physical activity and fat mass as modifiable risk factors of the intra-individual variation in metabolic control across the menstrual cycle in pre-menopausal women.",['MacGregor KA; Ho FK; Celis-Morales CA; Pell JP; Gallagher IJ; Moran CN'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38066548,association between menstrual cycle phase and metabolites in healthy women in UK Biobank. inflammatory markers and risk factors for metabolic disease are investigated.
Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) Induced Anaphylaxis in a Chinese Child with Lipid Transfer Protein Sensitization.,"Fruits have been identified as the primary triggers of anaphylaxis in older children in the Chinese population, especially among individuals with pollen sensitization. To date, no allergies have been reported after blueberry ingestion in the Chinese population. A 12-year-old girl experienced one episode of anaphylaxis within 30 minutes of having breakfast (including milk, egg, wheat bread, and blueberry) while walking to school. She menstruated during this episode. Prompt treatment with epinephrine and fluid therapy led to full recovery within 24 h. Specific IgE was conducted using ImmunoCAP, and the patient exhibited sensitization to several pollens, mainly Japanese hop (74.3 kUa/L) and mugwort (26.5 kUa/L). Regarding specific IgE to allergen components, the patient showed sensitization primarily to lipid transfer protein (LTP) components from mugwort Art v 3 (79.7 kUa/L), wheat Tri a 14 (12.4 kUa/L) and peach Pru p 3 (2.15 kUa/L), but tested negative for omega-5 gliadin. The prick test results were positive for blueberries (wheal size 9.5 mm), cherries (wheal size 6.5 mm), kiwifruits (wheal size 6 mm), and pears (wheal size 4.5 mm). Our patient was provided with an epi-pen and was advised to avoid consuming relevant fruits. After four months of follow-up, the patient had not experienced any episodes of anaphylaxis since these recommendations were implemented. We report for the first time a Chinese child with severe IgE-mediated immediate-type anaphylactic reaction to blueberries, in whom we identified LTP as the suspected allergen component.",['Jiang N; Xiang L; Guan H; Zhang X'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38022748,blueberry ingestion in a Chinese child with a lipid transfer protein Sensitization. no allergies have been reported after blueberry ingestion.
Social Stress during the Estrus or Luteal Phase in Sheep.,"In mammals, progesterone and estrogens affect the stress response. The study aimed to compare the physiological and behavioral responses to the social isolation of ewes during the estrus or luteal phase. Estrous and diestrous ewes (n = 10 and 8 respectively) were individually isolated in a novel place for 10 min. Ewes' behavior was recorded during the test. Cortisol, blood proteins and glucose concentrations, and the skin surface temperature were determined before and after the test. Cortisol increased immediately after the test ended (<i>P</i> = 0.02). Serum total protein (<i>P</i> = 0.02), globulin (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and plasma glucose (<i>P</i> = 0.006) concentrations were greater in estrus than in the luteal phase. The abdominal skin surface temperature was greater during estrus than during the luteal phase (<i>P</i> = 0.02). Ewes in estrus spent more time standing up immobile than ewes in the luteal phase (<i>P</i> = 0.05). In conclusion, the physiological and behavioral responses changed according to the phase of the estrous cycle. These results highlight the need for future studies focusing on how reproductive status influences the stress response to different management practices in sheep.",['Freitas-de-Melo A; Garcia Kako Rodriguez M; Crosa C; Ungerfeld R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38314791,study aimed to compare physiological and behavioral responses to social isolation of ewes during the estrus or luteal phase. ewes were individually isolated in a novel place for 10 min. cortisol increased immediately after the test ended (i>P/i> = 0.02)
The Cause of Vasomotor Symptoms: Resonance Phenomena in the Vascular Bed.,"This paper describes the probable cause of vasomotor symptoms during climacterics and before menstruation/ovulation.

Value of estrogen pretreatment in patients with diminished ovarian reserve and elevated FSH on a line antagonist regimen: a retrospective controlled study.,"The key to enhancing the efficacy of antagonistic regimens in pregnancy is to better synchronize follicular growth during cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), especially in patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). During in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatment, luteal phase estrogen pretreatment may enhance follicular development synchronization and yield of mature oocytes. However, the effect of estrogen pretreatment in DOR patients with elevated basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels has not been well studied. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with elevated basal FSH levels and DOR (401 cycles) who underwent IVF/intracytoplasmic monosperm injection (ICSI)-assisted conception. Both groups were treated with a flexible gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist regimen and were further divided into two groups according to whether they received luteal estrogen pretreatment. There were 79 patients in the estrogen pretreatment group and 322 patients in the control group. On the second day of the menstrual cycle, gonadotropin (Gn) stimulation of the ovaries was initiated. The general characteristics, clinical, biological parameters and outcomes of the two groups were compared. The basic profiles of the two groups were similar (P > 0.05). More patients in the pretreatment group showed FSH rebound after gonadotropin (Gn) initiation, resulting in a significantly higher number of Gn days and total Gn than those in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of days of antagonist use, follicle output rate (FORT), number of metaphase II(MII)eggs obtained, number of Two pronuclei (2PN) fertilized, number of D<sub>3</sub> quality embryos, blastocyst formation rate, fresh embryo clinical pregnancy rate, cumulative pregnancy rate, and non-transferable embryo rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). The use of luteal phase estrogen pretreatment in patients with elevated basal FSH combined with DOR resulted in high FSH levels after the release of negative feedback, which was detrimental to early follicular growth, did not increase the follicular output rate, may have increased the use and duration of controlled ovarian stimulation drugs, and did not increase the number of eggs gained or improve clinical outcomes.",['Lin L; Chen G; Liu Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38802887,retrospective controlled study analyzed clinical data of patients with elevated basal FSH levels. luteal phase estrogen pretreatment may enhance follicular development synchronization.
Non-genetic factors and breast cancer: an umbrella review of meta-analyses.,"Previous research has found associations between various non-genetic factors and breast cancer (BrCa) risk. This study summarises and appraises the credibility of the available evidence on the association between non-genetic factors and BrCa risk. We conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses. Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane databases were systematically searched for meta-analyses examining non-genetic factors and BrCa incidence or mortality. The strength of the evidence was graded in four categories (i.e., weak, suggestive, highly suggestive, convincing). A total of 781 meta-analyses from 280 publications were evaluated and graded. We included exposures related to anthropometric measurements, biomarkers, breast characteristics and diseases, diet and supplements, environment, exogenous hormones, lifestyle and social factors, medical history, medication, reproductive history, and pregnancy. The largest number of examined associations was found for the category of diet and supplements and for exposures such as aspirin use and active smoking. The statistically significant (P-value < 0.05) meta-analyses were 382 (49%), of which 204 (53.4%) reported factors associated with increased BrCa risk. Most of the statistically significant evidence (n = 224, 58.6%) was graded as weak. Convincing harmful associations with heightened BrCa risk were found for increased body mass index (BMI), BMI and weight gain in postmenopausal women, oral contraceptive use in premenopausal women, increased androstenedione, estradiol, estrone, and testosterone concentrations, high Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) classification, and increased breast density. Convincing protective factors associated with lower BrCa risk included high fiber intake and high sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels while highly suggestive protective factors included high 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, adherence to healthy lifestyle, and moderate-vigorous physical activity. Our findings suggest some highly modifiable factors that protect from BrCa. Interestingly, while diet was the most studied exposure category, the related associations failed to reach higher levels of evidence, indicating the methodological limitations in the field. To improve the validity of these associations, future research should utilise more robust study designs and better exposure assessment techniques. Overall, our study provides knowledge that supports the development of evidence-based BrCa prevention recommendations and guidance, both at an individual level and for public health initiatives.

Long-lived enhanced magnetization-A practical metabolic MRI contrast material.,"Noninvasive tracking of biochemical processes in the body is paramount in diagnostic medicine. Among the leading techniques is spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which tracks metabolites with an amplified (hyperpolarized) magnetization signal injected into the subject just before scanning. Traditionally, the brief enhanced magnetization period of these agents limited clinical imaging. We propose a solution based on amalgamating two materials-one having diagnostic-metabolic activity and the other characterized by robust magnetization retention. This combination slows the magnetization decay in the diagnostic metabolic probe, which receives continuously replenished magnetization from the companion material. Thus, it extends the magnetization lifetime in some of our measurements to beyond 4 min, with net magnetization enhanced by more than four orders of magnitude. This could allow the metabolic probes to remain magnetized from injection until they reach the targeted organ, improving tissue signatures in clinical imaging. Upon validation, this metabolic MRI technique promises wide-ranging clinical applications, including diagnostic imaging, therapeutic monitoring, and posttreatment surveillance.",['Katz I; Schmidt A; Ben-Shir I; Javitt M; Kouřil K; Capozzi A; Meier B; Lang A; Pokroy B; Blank A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38996017,spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracks metabolites with an amplified (hyperpolarized) magnetization signal injected into the subject just before scanning. a practical metabolic MRI contrast material is based on a combination of two materials.
Impact of Premenstrual Syndrome Symptoms on Sport Routines in Nonelite Athlete Participants of Summer Olympic Sports.,"Most women during their lifetime experience a combination of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms (eg, menstrual cramps) before and often to the end of menstruation. However, the impact of these symptoms on sport routines (eg, performance, training absence) during phases around menstruation is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the impact of PMS symptoms on sport routines among nonelite athletes over 3 phases related to menstruation. An online questionnaire was developed to recruit nonelite female athletes who participate in summer Olympic sports. Participants were allocated into 2 groups: those who experienced mild to moderate PMS symptoms (no-PMS) and those with severe PMS symptoms (p-PMS). Two hundred thirty-four responses from eumenorrheic women (p-PMS = 78%) were considered valid. An unpaired Student t test was conducted to compare demographic characteristics between groups and chi-square test to evaluate the impact of PMS status on sport routines between groups. A significant (P < .05) proportion of women in the p-PMS group changed their training schedule because of menstrual (55%) and premenstrual (61%) symptoms compared with the no-PMS group. Overall, all participants indicated that training (P = .01) and competitive (P < .01) performance are impacted during menstruation, followed by a greater impact (P < .05) in the p-PMS group before menstruation. The presence of PMS symptoms reduces training and competitive performance, primarily during and before menstruation, respectively. Severity of PMS symptoms was significantly associated with alterations in training schedule but not with competitive schedule.",['Prado RCR; Willett HN; Takito MY; Hackney AC'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36577421,nonelite athletes were recruited into 2 groups to experience mild to moderate PMS symptoms. participants were allocated into 2 groups: those with mild to moderate PMS symptoms (no-PMS) and those with severe PMS symptoms (p-PMS)
National survey on psychosocial obstetrics and gynecology curriculum in US medical schools.,"This study sought to identify how psychosocial topics related to women's health are taught and assessed in the obstetrics/gynecology program of American medical schools, and what issues may prevent or promote their instruction. A questionnaire was distributed to the ob/gyn clerkship director of every US medical school. Directors were asked whether each of four recommended topics were covered in their curricula. They were also asked about barriers to instructing topics not taught, and the importance of these topics. Out of 136 US medical schools, 57 questionnaires were returned (response rate = 40.4%). In all, 27 schools (48%) include formal training in pregnancy-related mood disorders, 33 (58%) include pre-menstrual syndrome/pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder, 29 (51%) include female sexual dysfunction and 45 (79%) include violence against women. Six schools (12%) listed none of these topics as taught. All but three of the clerkship directors agreed that psychosocial topics are important. The most common reason given for lack of instruction was insufficient time allotted. Despite agreement on their importance, many US medical schools do not teach psychosocial aspects of women's health. Addressing the barriers to teaching these topics would help provide medical students with more opportunities to learn about these issues.",['Schaffir J; Waddell V; Watson D; Way D'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24766531,study sought to identify how psychosocial topics related to women's health are taught in the obstetrics/gynecology program of american medical schools. directors were asked whether each of four recommended topics were covered in their curricula.
Psychologists partnering with obstetricians and gynecologists: Meeting the need for patient-centered models of women's health care delivery.,"As obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) practices move toward becoming patient-centered medical homes for their patients, the need for providing integrated behavioral health care has increased. Themes common in ob/gyn settings-such as menstruation concerns, initiation of contraception, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause-serve as occasions for health promotion and as life transitions where behavioral health concerns may arise. When these transitions are complicated by issues such as trauma, infertility, and pregnancy loss, the need for sensitive, collaborative care between psychology and obstetrics/gynecology becomes particularly critical. Women's health psychologists can serve a key role for ob/gyn practices by co-managing patients' care, offering consultation to providers, providing brief behavioral health consultations to patients, facilitating psychotherapy engagement, and providing treatment for women and their families.",['Poleshuck EL; Woods J'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24820684,obstetrics and gynecology practices are becoming patient-centered medical homes for their patients. the need for integrated behavioral health care has increased as ob/gyn practices become patient-centered.
"Sibling composition and household room sharing are associated with menarcheal status among rural Bengalee girls of West Bengal, India.","Menarche, the first menstruation, is one of the most important events in a woman's reproductive life. The timing of menarche varies across populations and depends upon social interaction and family environment. It is also associated with several biological as well as social factors. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between sibling composition and age at menarche (AAM) and to assess the association between the pattern of room sharing with family members of different sexes and menarcheal occurrence among rural Bengalee girls from West Bengal, India. The total sample comprised 577 Bengalee girls, 6-17 years of age, from various schools and madrasas in two blocks of the Nadia District of West Bengal State in India. The effects of room sharing on the occurrence of menarche, and of sibling composition on the menarcheal age, were assessed by analyses of covariance. The room-sharing pattern had a significant effect on menarcheal status (yes÷no): a significantly higher percentage of girls who shared a room with the mother and÷or sisters were postmenarcheal compared with those who shared a room with male family members. AAM did not differ significantly between girls having brothers or sisters. However, sibling order had a significant impact on AAM. Girls who had a younger sibling only (brother or sister) had a higher mean AAM, and girls who had both younger brothers and younger sisters had significantly higher mean AAM, than did the girls who had no younger sibling (singletons or having only elder siblings). There was no difference in AAM between the girls who had younger sister(s) and those who had younger brother(s). These differences were also independent of body mass index. In conclusion, the room sharing characteristics and the sibling sex composition, particularly their order, had significant effect on menarche in adolescent rural Bengalee girls.",['Biswas S; Koziel S; Chakraborty R; Bose K'],2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25019192,menarche is one of the most important events in a woman's reproductive life. timing of menarche depends on social interaction and family environment. study was to assess the association between room sharing and age.
Assessment of prevalence and factors affecting Mastalgia among early reproductive-aged women in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional survey.,"Mastalgia, or breast pain, is a prevalent and distressing condition experienced by women, impacting their daily lives and causing complications. It is common among women of reproductive age, with associations found with premenstrual syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease, psychological distress, and, in rare cases, breast cancer. While Western societies have high frequencies of Mastalgia, it is less diagnosed in Asian cultures including Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with Mastalgia among early reproductive-aged women in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, and data were collected from different regions of the country. A convenience sampling method was used to take 1,214 participants for the study. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to ascertain factors that were significantly associated with Mastalgia. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software 26 version. All the participants were female (mean age: 22.87 ± 2.64 years; age ranges: 18-35 years). The prevalence of Mastalgia was found to be 35.5%. The study was conducted using a self-reported semi-structured questionnaire. Participants with a higher education level and higher income were more likely to experience Mastalgia. A family history of breast cancer and severe abdominal pain during menstruation were also identified as associated factors for Mastalgia (p < 0.05). This study enhances our understanding of Mastalgia in Bangladesh, offering insights for healthcare and policy. Further research is required to uncover its root causes and develop effective interventions. The study highlights the prevalence of mastalgia and its related factors, emphasizing the necessity for increased awareness and support for affected women.",['Siddique AB; Nath SD; Mubarak M; Akter A; Mehrin S; Hkatun MJ; Liza AP; Islam MS; Amin MZ; Ferdous MZ'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37978504,"women of reproductive age are more likely to experience Mastalgia. women with premenstrual syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease and psychological distress are more likely to experience it."
"Decision-making pathways for contraceptive use among refugee and host populations in Adjumani district, Uganda; an exploratory study.","Contraceptive use is known to have a positive impact on maternal and child health outcomes; however, its use is still low in low-income countries, especially among people in humanitarian situations. This study explored decision-making processes towards the use of contraceptives by people in humanitarian situations to inform program design and uptake. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and men (15-60 years) living in three refugee settlements of Pagirinya, Nyumanzi, and Mirieyi and the surrounding host communities in Adjumani district, Uganda. Data were collected using 49 in-depth interviews (IDIs), 11 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs,) and 20 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Inductive thematic analysis was done with the aid of Atlas ti. Version 14. We found that the decision-making processes entailed linear and nonlinear internalized cognitive and contextual processes involving four dynamic pathways. In the linear pathway, participants reported starting with 1) idea inception, 2) followed by cognitive processing, 3) consultation, and 4) decision-making for contraceptive use. The complex linear pathway happened when participants did not go through consultation but went straight to decision-making. However, participants who followed the non-linear pathway repeatedly went back to cognitive processing. Some women after consultation, or those already using and those not using contraceptives, decided to go back to cognitive processing to reconsider their current positions. This study found that some women who were not using contraceptives ended up using, while some who were using contraception ended up dropping out. This study showed dynamic decision-making processes involving both internal and external environments as triggers to decision-making for contraceptive use. Interventions to increase contraceptive use should target both users and significant others who influence the decision to use particularly among refugees.

Effectiveness of menstruation hygiene skills training for adolescents with autism.,"Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may encounter many difficulties with their menstrual cycles. Potential challenges that adolescents with ASD may face include understanding physical changes, coping with symptoms, emotional sensitivity, communication, personal care, and hygiene. To evaluate the effect of menstrual hygiene skills training given to adolescents with ASD on their menstrual hygiene skills. The study was conducted with 15 adolescents diagnosed with ASD by the single group pre-test and post-test model in three special education centers in Türkiye. Data were collected with the Adolescent and Parent Information Form and the Adolescent-Specific Menstrual Hygiene Skill Registration Form. While the mean age of adolescents was 16.06 ± 0.88 years, the mean age of individuals responsible for adolescent care was 43.66 ± 5.56 years. While 60.0% of the adolescents noticed the onset of bleeding before training, this rate was 93.3% after training. The Adolescent-Specific Menstrual Hygiene Skill Registration Form showed a statistically significant increase in the application steps after the training. The difference between the menstrual hygiene skill scores of adolescents diagnosed with ASD before and after training was significant. The menstrual hygiene skills training given to adolescents with ASD was beneficial in increasing their menstrual hygiene skills.

"Serum iron availability, but not iron stores, is lower in naturally menstruating than in oral contraceptive athletes.","This study measured serum markers of iron status in naturally menstruating and oral contraceptive (OC) athletes during the main hormonal milieus of these two profiles to identify potential differences confounding the diagnosis of iron deficiency in female athletes. Resting blood samples were collected from 36 naturally menstruating athletes during the early-follicular phase (EFP), mid- late-follicular phase (MLFP) and mid-luteal phase (MLP) of the menstrual cycle. Simultaneously, blood samples were collected from 24 OC athletes during the withdrawal and active-pill phase of the OC cycle. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 and sex hormones were analyzed. Naturally menstruating athletes showed lower levels of TSAT, iron and transferrin than OC athletes when comparing the bleeding phase of both profiles (<i>p</i><0.05) as well as when comparing all analyzed phases of the menstrual cycle to the active pill phase of the OC cycle (<i>p</i><0.05). Interestingly, only lower transferrin was found during MLFP and MLP compared to the withdrawal phase of the OC cycle (<i>p</i>>0.05), with all other iron markers showing no differences (<i>p</i>>0.05). Intracycle variations were also found within both types of cycle, presenting reduced TSAT and iron during menstrual bleeding phases (<i>p</i><0.05). In conclusion, in OC athletes, serum iron availability, but not serum ferritin, seems higher than in naturally menstruating ones. However, such differences are lost when comparing the MLFP and MLP of the menstrual cycle with the withdrawal phase of the OC cycle. This should be considered in the assessment of iron status in female athletes.<b>Highlights</b> Naturally menstruating athletes present lower TSAT, iron and transferrin in all analyzed phases of the menstrual cycle compared to OC athletes during their active pill phase. However, both the mid-late follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle do not differ from the withdrawal phase of the oral contraceptive cycle.Intracycle variations are found for TSAT and iron in both naturally menstruating and oral contraceptive athletes, which are mainly driven by a reduction in TSAT and iron during menstrual bleeding phases.As serum iron availability changes significantly as a function of the athlete's hormonal status, it should be considered in the assessment of the athlete's iron status as well as standardise the phase of the menstrual cycle in which to assess iron markers to avoid misdiagnosis or misleading results.In contrast, the assessment of iron stores through serum ferritin is substantially stable and the athlete's hormonal status does not seem to be of relevance for this purpose.",['Alfaro-Magallanes VM; Romero-Parra N; Barba-Moreno L; Rael B; Benito PJ; Díaz ÁE; Cupeiro R; Peinado AB'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904534,"iron availability is lower in naturally menstruating athletes than in oral contraceptive athletes. resting blood samples were collected from 36 naturally menstruating athletes during the early-follicular phase (EFP), mid- late-follicular phase (MLFP) and mid-luteal phase (MLP) of the menstrual cycle."
Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Among Menopaused Females in Al-Qassim Region.,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women worldwide including those in Saudi Arabia. The risk of developing BC can be lowered by reducing risk factors through early screening and by women having full knowledge of this condition. The aim of this study is thus to evaluate knowledge of the importance of early screening and detection of BC among post-menopausal women in Saudi Arabia's Qassim region and to compare it with pre-menopausal women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among post-menopausal women in the Qassim region. Data were collected by using a pre-tested, pre-coded, validated self-administered online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Social Package of Statistical Science) Statistics version 23.0. Data were collected from 1386 women who agreed to participate in this study, of which 484 women reported that their menstruation had stopped (34.9%). In general, it was found that 73.7% of the participants had adequate knowledge with a significant difference between pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women. Concerning knowledge of BC (p = 0.042), pre-menopausal women had a higher level of knowledge (75.5% had adequate knowledge compared with 70.5% of post-menopausal women). Considering the source of knowledge of the participants regarding BC, websites or social media is considered the main source for 71.8% of the participants, followed by family and friends (52.2%). Concerning the knowledge about the risk factors of BC, 26.4% of the participants reported that they did not know them, and 11.8% of the participants did not know any of the symptoms of BC. In this study, the knowledge of post-menopausal women was found to be adequate; however, it is significantly lower than that of the pre-menopausal women. Educational level is a significant factor that affects the level of knowledge regarding BC risk factors and different modalities for diagnosis and approaches for management, and this indicates the importance of increasing interest in education in our society.",['AlSuwaydani SA; Alshamikh AS; Alotaibi RA; Almutairi KO; Alkhulifi BH'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37575840,breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women worldwide. the risk of developing BC can be lowered by reducing risk factors through early screening and by women having full knowledge of this condition.
Understanding Adolescent Gynecological Issues: A Cross-Sectional Study at a Tertiary Care Center.,"Adolescence is a crucial phase in a woman's life, as it signifies the beginning of her reproductive journey. During this time, there are notable variations in sexual development and a sense of caution that can present challenges for healthcare providers. The rationale for studying adolescent gynecological problems lies in the need to understand and address the unique reproductive health challenges faced by young girls. By investigating these issues, researchers and healthcare professionals can develop effective strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment of gynecological conditions in adolescents. This knowledge is crucial for promoting the overall well-being and reproductive health of young girls, ensuring they receive appropriate care and support during this critical stage of development. This study focuses on identifying the most common gynecological issues in teenagers, exploring the root causes, examining the available treatment options, and understanding how they are managed at a tertiary care facility.  Methods: This cross-sectional observational study took place at a tertiary care center and focused on gynecological issues in adolescent females who sought care at the gynecology department from January 2016 to December 2022. The study participants were categorized into three groups: early adolescence (10-13 years), middle adolescence (14-16 years), and late adolescence (17-19 years) for analysis. Ethical approval was obtained for this hospital-based research, which involved examining, investigating, and treating the study participants. Out of the 49,700 new female patients, 2000 (4.02%) fell within the specified age range. The average age of the participants was 16.87±2.16, and the majority of them sought help for menstrual issues (63.45%), followed by abdominal discomfort (15.6%) and vaginal discharge (7.2%). Menstrual disorders were the most common concern, with dysmenorrhea and puberty menorrhagia being prevalent issues. Abdominal pain was caused by various factors, such as urinary tract infections, ovarian tumors, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and endometrial tuberculosis. The majority of cases were treated conservatively, with only a small percentage requiring surgical intervention. The significance of early detection and intervention in addressing gynecological issues among adolescents is highlighted in the findings of this research, underscoring the necessity for specialized healthcare services that cater to the specific needs of this demographic. Adolescent gynecology plays a crucial role in safeguarding the reproductive health and overall well-being of young women, emphasizing the importance of seeking assistance proactively.",['Agarwal M; Singh S; Jyoti C; Sinha S; Simran S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38711716,"study at tertiary care center focused on gynecological issues in adolescent females who sought care at the gynecology department from January 2016 to December 2022. participants were categorized into three groups: early adolescence (10-13 years), middle adolescence (14-16 years), and late adolescence (17-19-1922)."

Temporal changes in plasma metabolic signatures to predict immune response of antiretroviral therapy among people living with HIV.,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an effective treatment for people living with HIV (PLHIVs), requiring an extended period to achieve immune reconstitution. Metabolic alterations induced by ART are crucial for predicting long-term therapeutic responses, yet comprehensive investigation through large-scale clinical studies is still lacking. Here, we collected plasma samples from 108 PLHIVs to the untargeted plasma metabolomics study, based on the longitudinal metabolomics design. Cross-sectional analyzes were performed at pre- and post-ART to explore the metabolic transformation induced by the therapy. Subsequently, delta values between pre- and post-ART measurements were calculated to quantify metabolic alterations. Then, the optimal set of metabolic traits and clinical signatures were further identified and applied to construct random forest model for predicting the future therapeutic responses to ART. We found distinct ART-induced metabolic transformation among PLHIVs. After confounder-adjustments, five metabolites exhibited significant associations with future immune response: tetracosatetraenoic acid (24:4n-6) (pre-ART) (odds ratio [OR]: 0.978, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.955~0.997), 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-3-decanone (pre-ART) (OR: 1.298, 95% CI: 1.061~1.727), beta-PC-M6 (change) (OR: 0.967, 95% CI: 0.938~0.993), d-Galactaro-1,4-lactone (change) (OR: 1.032, 95% CI: 1.007~1.063), Annuionone C (change) (OR: 1.100, 95% CI: 1.030~1.190). The addition of plasma metabolites to clinical markers accurately predicted immune response to ART with an area under curve of 0.91. Notably, most disrupted metabolites were significantly correlated with blood lipids, suggesting that metabolic transformation might contribute to dyslipidemia among PLHIVs. This study highlights the distinct metabolic transformation post-ART among PLHIVs and reveals the potential role of metabolic transformation as key determinants of ART efficacy.",['Li J; Lv J; Yu F; Zhang Y; Wang Y; Yan L; Xiao Q; Li Q; Wang C; Wang X; Hou Y; Zhang F; Zhang T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39056244,antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an effective treatment for people living with HIV.

Long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake across the life span for cardiovascular disease prevention in women.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major health concern for women. Historically there has been a misconception that men are at greater risk because CVD tends to occur earlier in life compared to women. Clinical guidelines for prevention of heart disease are currently the same for both sexes, but accumulating evidence demonstrates that risk profiles diverge. In fact, several CVD risk factors confer an even greater risk in women relative to men, including high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and raised triglycerides. Furthermore, many female-specific CVD risk factors exist, including early menarche, pregnancy complications, polycystic ovary syndrome, reproductive hormonal treatments and menopause. Little is known about how diet interacts with CVD risk factors at various stages of a woman’s life. Long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intakes are a key dietary factor that may impact risk of CVD throughout the life course differentially in men and women. Oestrogen enhances conversion of the plant n-3 PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid, to LCn-3 PUFA. Increasing the frequency of oily fish consumption or LCn-3 PUFA supplementation may be important for reducing coronary risk during the menopausal transition, during which time oestrogen levels decline and the increase in CVD risk factors is accelerated. Women are under-represented in the evidence base for CVD prevention following LC n-3 PUFA supplementation. Therefore it is not clear whether there are sex differences in response to treatment. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on optimal intakes of LC n-3 PUFA across the lifespan for CVD prevention in women.",['Hall WL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38444046,"long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intakes are a key dietary factor that may impact risk of CVD throughout the life course differentially in men and women. oestrogen enhances conversion of the plant n-3 PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid, to LCn-3 PUFA."
"Sexual behaviour among women using intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, a copper intrauterine device, or a levonorgestrel implant for contraception: Data from the ECHO randomized trial.","Contraceptive use has complex effects on sexual behaviour and mood, including those related to reduced concerns about unintended pregnancy, direct hormonal effects and effects on endogenous sex hormones. We set out to obtain robust evidence on the relative effects of three contraceptive methods on sex behaviours, which is important for guiding contraceptive choice and future contraceptive developments. This is a secondary analysis of data from the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) randomized trial in which 7,829 HIV-uninfected women from 12 sites in Eswatini, Kenya, South Africa and Zambia seeking contraception were randomly assigned to intramuscular depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) or the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant. Data collected for 12 to 18 months using 3-monthly behavioural questionnaires that relied on recall from the preceding 3 months, were used to estimate relative risk of post-baseline sex behaviours, as well as sexual desire and menstrual bleeding between randomized groups using modified Poisson regression. We observed small but generally consistent effects wherein DMPA-IM users reported lower prevalence of specified high risk sexual behaviours than implant users than Cu-IUD users (the '>' and '<' symbols indicate statistically significant differences): multiple sex partners 3.6% < 4.8% < 6.2% respectively; new sex partner 3.0% < 4.0% <5.3%; coital acts 16.45, 16.65, 17.12 (DMPA-IM < Cu-IUD); unprotected sex 65% < 68%, 70%; unprotected sex past 7 days 33% <36%, 37%; sex during vaginal bleeding 7.1%, 7.1% < 8.9%; no sex acts 4.1%, 3.8%, 3.4% (DMPA-IM > Cu-IUD); partner has sex with others 10% < 11%, 11%. The one exception was having any sex partner 96.5%, 96.9% < 97.4% (DMPA-IM < Cu-IUD). Decrease in sexual desire was reported by 1.6% > 1.1% >0.5%; amenorrhoea by 49% > 41% >12% and regular menstrual pattern by 26% <35% < 87% respectively. These findings suggest that women assigned to DMPA-IM may have a modest decrease in libido and sexual activity relative to the implant, and the implant relative to the Cu-IUD. We found more menstrual disturbance with DMPA-IM than with the implant (and as expected, both more than the Cu-IUD). These findings are important for informing the contraceptive choices of women and policymakers and highlight the need for robust comparison of the effects of other contraceptive methods as well.",['Hofmeyr GJ; Singata-Madliki M; Batting J; Steyn P; Thomas KK; Issema R; Beesham I; Mbatsane E; Morrison C; Deese J; Smit J; Philip N; Palanee-Phillips T; Reddy K; Onono M; Mastro TD; Baeten JM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38722832,"a randomized trial was conducted in a randomized trial in a randomized trial. 7,829 women from 12 sites in eswatini, Kenya, south africa and Zambia seeking contraception were randomly assigned to intramuscular depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate. the data was collected for 12 to 18 months using 3-monthly behavioural questionnaires that relied on recall from the preceding 3 months."
Drospirenone 4 mg-only pill (DOP) in 24+4 regimen: a new option for oral contraception.,"The use of progestin-only pills (POPs) is still relatively infrequent, mainly for their unpredictable effect on menstrual bleeding. A new POP consisting of 4 mg drospirenone (DRSP) for 24 days plus 4-day hormone-free interval has been developed to address this need. DRSP is a potent progestin analogue of spironolactone, with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties. This is a narrative review of the available data on the pharmacotherapy of the new DRSP-only pill. The research includes aspects of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the compound: the main focus is on the clinical effects of DRSP-only pill in terms of contraceptive efficacy, haemostatic effect, safety, tolerability and bleeding patterns. The DRSP-only pill presents a similar Pearl Index to that of common combined hormonal contraceptives: it is a POP with a better bleeding profile than traditional POPs (higher rates of scheduled bleedings and much lower rates of unscheduled intracyclic bleeding/spotting) which could increase its acceptability and the panorama of possible users. For these reasons, DRSP-only pill represents a real step forward in oral contraception with only progestins, even if the bleeding patterns during its use are still different to oestrogen-containing products (i.e. lower rates of scheduled bleedings and higher rate of amenorrhea).",['Chiara Del Savio M; De Fata R; Facchinetti F; Grandi G'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32538188,DRSP is a potent progestin analogue of spironolactone. it is a similar Pearl Index to that of combined hormonal contraceptives.

Psychological Experiences in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Qualitative Study.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive years. In addition to multiple physical problems, this syndrome has many psychological complications. Thus, the present study attempted to explore the psychological experiences of women with PCOS in Iran's sociocultural context. The study was carried out in Isfahan, Iran, using a qualitative content analysis method. The participants were selected through purposive sampling from women with PCOS, their spouses, and healthcare providers in hospitals, clinics, workplaces, universities, and physicians' offices between September 2018 and November 2019. Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews until data saturation. Data analysis was based on conventional content analysis. The interviews were transcribed and coded. Afterward, categories and concepts were extracted by grouping similar codes. A total of 13 women with PCOS, four spouses, and 13 healthcare providers participated in this study. Data analysis yielded five main categories, including the patient's psychological reactions following infertility and its probability, psychological issues following menstrual disorders, patients' fear and concerns about the probability of developing chronic diseases, psychological problems following the disease, and psychological problems resulting from body appearance. The results of this study showed that women with PCOS were exposed to multiple psychological problems. Therefore, preventing and controlling the psychological consequences of PCOS and its complications requires healthcare providers' support and comprehensive and long-term planning to promote the mental health of these women.",['Farajzadegan Z; Kazemi A; Salehi M; ZareMobini F'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37694209,"study was carried out in Isfahan, Iran, using a qualitative content analysis method. participants were selected through purposive sampling from women with PCOS, their spouses, and healthcare providers."
"Evaluation of knowledge, attitude, practices and effectiveness of menstrual hygiene interventions in rural schools from Lilongwe, Malawi.","Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is associated with the menstrual process in women and adolescent girls who face cultural and financial challenges in rural areas of many developing countries. As part of the pilot study, we assessed the sustainability and effectiveness of the approaches and lessons learned from the MHM project intervention in rural areas of Lilongwe, Malawi. Rural primary schools (n = 4) were purposively selected where an MHM intervention was implemented in Lilongwe, Malawi. The study employed a mixed-method research design. Assessments and data collection were performed through surveys of learners, literature reviews, key informant interviews (KIIs) (n = 90), and 20 focus group discussions (FGDs). The study participants included boys and adolescent girls (n = 100, 11-19 years; grades 5-8), teachers, mother groups, and community leaders from the selected schools. All the schools had water sanitation and hygiene facilities and latrines (45% improved, 54% ventilated improved pit latrines - VIPs) that promoted menstrual hygiene for adolescent girls. However, two of the schools studied (50%, n = 4) did not have separate washrooms for changing sanitary materials. There was a slight increase in latrine coverage in Kabuthu zone communities (90% at baseline versus 93.4% at midterm). However, the coverage dropped to 85.7% at the final evaluation, which was attributed to too much rain received in the area that damaged most of the latrines. There was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the number of girls failing to attend classes due to menstruation (70% at baseline versus 14% at final evaluation). Furthermore, the project resulted in the majority of girls (94.4%) having access to school. There was a strong uptake and adoption of sanitary products (reusable pads and menstrual cups) among adolescent girls of all age groups. The study has demonstrated that the inclusion of key stakeholders such as health workers, parents, mother groups and community leaders promoted the uptake and sustainability of reusable pads and menstrual cups and MHM interventions and programs. The MHM project implementation improved adolescent girls' education in the area. The inclusion of boys and other key stakeholders in the health education talks addressed issues of stigma and discrimination. The study, therefore, calls for comprehensive training on MHM and hygiene education to remove discrimination and harmful cultural practices.",['Chidya R; Kachuma O; Thole T; Banda L; Loewenberger M; Nicholson J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38811971,"rural primary schools were purposively selected where an MHM intervention was implemented in Lilongwe, Malawi. the study participants included boys and adolescent girls (n = 100, 11-19 years; grades 5-8), teachers, mother groups, and community leaders from the selected schools."
Sexual and reproductive history of female prisoners in Iran: a health care needs analysis.,"According to estimates, there are approximately 714,000 female prisoners in the world. A considerable proportion are pregnant, of childbearing age at the time of incarceration and may experience numerous reproductive health concerns. The purpose of this study is to examine the demographics and sexual and reproductive history of female prisoners in Iran. Four hundred and thirty-four female prisoners (mean age: 39.0 ± 9.9) serving sentences at Qarchak prison, Iran, completed a questionnaire. The participants were recruited between October 2017 and September 2018 using a convenient sampling method. The questionnaire captured sociodemographic characteristics and sexual and reproductive history. Most respondents had 7-12 years of formal education, were housewives (69.9%), were either married (41.6%) or divorced (41.8%) and were literate (91.3%). History of drug use among the respondents was 34.7%. Most respondents had regular menstruation (63.5%) and were pre-menopausal (86.1%). Natural birth control was preferred (39.7%) compared to other methods, such as condoms (18%) and oral contraceptive pills (8.4%). Spontaneous and induced abortions were reported by 17.8% and 16.4% of respondents, respectively. There was 5.9% of respondents that reported having a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) before incarceration, with HPV the most common (12.7%). This study has limitations, including the problem of following up with prisoners to shorten the average length of their imprisonment, which can leave many issues in the field of women's health and their follow-up incomplete. Prison health care workers should also follow up on women's health and pregnancy hygiene after their release because there is usually a high prevalence of STIs in prisoners. The findings highlight the importance of improving the quality of women's health care and pregnancy-related care in prisons. Additionally, the importance of having a health protocol for incarcerated women in Iran. Other programs should also be implemented for women prisoners to eliminate the discrimination they may face in prison. The international community has attempted to develop care guidelines for pregnant prisoners, particularly for prenatal and mental health services. However, currently in Iran no such guidelines have been developed. To date no research has explored the sexual health among female prisoners of this country. The aim of the present study was to examine the demographics and sexual and reproductive history of female prisoners in Iran. A secondary aim was to identify the health care needs of female prisoners in Iran.",['Farhoudi B; Shahmohamadi E; SeyedAlinaghi S; Rostam Afshar Z; Mirzapour P; Nadji S; Golsoorat Pahlaviani F; Tashakorian M; Hackett D'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37143342,"714,000 female prisoners in the world are pregnant, of childbearing age at the time of incarceration. a considerable proportion are pregnant, of childbearing age at the time of incarceration and may experience numerous reproductive health concerns."
Peak detection in intracranial pressure signal waveforms: a comparative study.,"The monitoring and analysis of quasi-periodic biological signals such as electrocardiography (ECG), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) waveforms plays an important role in the early detection of adverse patient events and contributes to improved care management in the intensive care unit (ICU). This work quantitatively evaluates existing computational frameworks for automatically extracting peaks within ICP waveforms. Peak detection techniques based on state-of-the-art machine learning models were evaluated in terms of robustness to varying noise levels. The evaluation was performed on a dataset of ICP signals assembled from 700 h of monitoring from 64 neurosurgical patients. The groundtruth of the peak locations was established manually on a subset of 13, 611 pulses. Additional evaluation was performed using a simulated dataset of ICP with controlled temporal dynamics and noise. The quantitative analysis of peak detection algorithms applied to individual waveforms indicates that most techniques provide acceptable accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>≤</mo> <mn>10</mn></mrow> </math> ms without noise. In the presence of a higher noise level, however, only kernel spectral regression and random forest remain below that error threshold while the performance of other techniques deteriorates. Our experiments also demonstrated that tracking methods such as Bayesian inference and long short-term memory (LSTM) can be applied continuously and provide additional robustness in situations where single pulse analysis methods fail, such as missing data. While machine learning-based peak detection methods require manually labeled data for training, these models outperform conventional signal processing ones based on handcrafted rules and should be considered for peak detection in modern frameworks. In particular, peak tracking methods that incorporate temporal information between successive periods of the signals have demonstrated in our experiments to provide more robustness to noise and temporary artifacts that commonly arise as part of the monitoring setup in the clinical setting.",['Wei M; Krakauskaite S; Subramanian S; Scalzo F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38915091,"the monitoring and analysis of quasi-periodic biological signals such as electrocardiography (ECG), intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) waveforms plays an important role in the early detection of adverse patient events. the evaluation was performed on a dataset of ICP signals assembled from 700 h of monitoring from 64 neurosurgical patients."
The Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Menstrual Abnormalities in Saudi Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Adults in Saudi Arabia are more likely to be obese, which has negative effects on reproductive health, especially for women. While bariatric surgery (BS) provides a sustainable approach, little is known about how it affects menstrual health and requires a study among the Saudi demographic. The current investigation is a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using an online questionnaire to assess the impact of BS on menstrual abnormalities in women. Data were cleaned in Excel and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp., Version 24.0, Armonk, NY). This study included 516 Saudi women who underwent various BS procedures, with 37.2% aged 18-30 years and 97.9% residing in Saudi Arabia. Approximately 85.9% underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), experiencing a mean weight loss of 54.2 kg. Co-morbidities included polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (12.4%), hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (11%), uterine fibroids (4.7%), and hormonal imbalances (2.5%). Post-surgery, 18% encountered BS complications from BS, while 8.3% used antidepressants. Moderate sports participation ranged from 12.2% (five or more days) to 36.2% (one to three days). In particular, no significant associations were found between complications and various parameters, except a marginal association with educational level (p=0.071). The number of menstruations per year did not change statistically significantly, remaining constant at 10.6±4.8 before surgery and 10.6±4.9 after surgery (p = 0.859). However, there was a mild decrease in the amount and duration of menstruation, reported by 23.3% and 27.3% of the participants preoperatively and post-operatively, respectively. The study demonstrates the impact of BS on menstrual abnormalities in Saudi women. Despite a significant weight reduction, we found mild improvement in the amount and duration of menstruation with no substantial effect observed on the menstrual cycle frequency. Psychological support after surgery is crucial, considering the increased use of antidepressants.",['Alhumaidan L; Alrefaei GM; Alfantoukh AM; Alsaeri AS; Almuayrifi MJ; Alfehaid M; Al-Kadi AS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38544663,study was conducted in a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia. study included 516 women who underwent various BS procedures. a total of 37.2% aged 18-30 years and 97.9% residing in Saudi Arabia.
Grief intensity following adolescent miscarriage or abortion: A descriptive study of recollections of adult women.,"The purpose of this study was to examine women's recollected lifespan perceptions of the effect of grief intensity following adolescent perinatal death. Nineteen adult women who had experienced either a miscarriage or an abortion during adolescence. The study involved the recollection of events surrounding the experience which had occurred between three and 28 years previously. A 55-item online survey was used to gather recollected perceptions of adolescent miscarriage and abortion experiences. The Perinatal Grief Intensity Scale was embedded within this survey. The participants were instructed to recall their responses to the perinatal loss at the time of the event as an adolescent (T1; Time 1) and how they feel currently as adults about their previous adolescent perinatal death (T2; Time 2). Data were collected at both T1 and T2. The Perinatal Grief Intensity Scale is accompanied by an appropriately weighted Excel scoring sheet which was utilised to analyse the data at both T1 and T2. As adolescents, participants perceived similar high and medium grief intensity when compared by type of loss (miscarriage, n = 6; abortion, n = 6). However, more women who had an abortion (n = 5) experienced low grief intensity compared with participants who had a miscarriage (n = 2). As adults, participants continued to perceive similar high and medium grief intensity when compared by type of loss (miscarriage, n = 6; abortion, n = 5). In addition, women who had an abortion continued to experience more low grief intensity (n = 6) compared with participants who had a miscarriage (n = 2). Approximately one quarter of adult female respondents, 26 % (n = 5) exhibited increased grief intensity as measured by the scores over time. Thirty seven percent (n = 7) exhibited no change in scores, and 37 % (n = 7) exhibited decreased scores over time in response to adolescent miscarriage or abortion. Support for the adoption of the Perinatal Grief Intensity Scale to identify women in need of follow-up for grief intensity after an adolescent miscarried or terminated pregnancy is evident. The results of this study have demonstrated that grief can resurge or appear in adult females as they respond to events across the lifespan, including further reproductive experiences. Therefore there is a compulsion for health care professionals to identify women at risk of intensive grief responses due to previous contributory events. Healthcare providers should screen adult women who have experienced a previous adolescent miscarriage or termination for adverse mental health issues in adulthood.",['Lloyd CA; Hutti MH'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071695,study examined women's recollected lifespan perceptions of grief intensity following adolescent miscarriage or abortion. nineteen adult women who had experienced either a miscarriage or an abortion during adolescence experienced low grief intensity compared with participants who had a miscarriage (n = 5)
Adolescents' height and cognitive ability in China.,"Cognitive ability, as an early human capital, has always been an important research object in modern education and labor economics. Despite growing awareness of the importance of height in individual growth and development, there are few empirical studies on height and cognitive ability. Using the data from the China Education Panel Survey, this paper examined the impact of height on the cognitive ability of adolescents and explored the reasons behind the Chinese pursuit of height growth and the potential impact mechanism. In this paper, comprehensive analysis ability was taken as the representative of cognitive ability. The empirical results showed that height was positively correlated with cognitive ability. From the perspective of the influence mechanism, the hypothesis that height reflected self-esteem, health, non-cognitive ability, and other influences on cognitive ability was excluded. To correct the errors that endogenous problems may cause, we used the PSM method and ""age at first menstruation "" and ""age at first wet dream"" as instrumental variables to correct them. The results showed that height still affected cognitive ability, with taller people having higher cognitive ability.",['Guo XH; Wang MY; Chou LC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38590882,study examined impact of height on cognitive ability of adolescents. study found that height was positively correlated with cognitive ability. study also examined the reasons behind the pursuit of height growth.
Evaluation of Hormonal Profile and Ovarian Morphology among Adolescent Girls with Menstrual Irregularities in a Tertiary Care Centre at Central India.,"Menstrual disturbances are common among adolescents with a prevalence rate of 11.3-26.7%. The most frequent menstrual irregularities are oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, polymenorrhoea, and hypomenorrhea. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is now recognized as the most prevalent endocrine disorder among the women of reproductive age. The current study was planned to evaluate socio-demographic factors, endocrine profiles, and ovarian morphology among adolescent girls with menstrual irregularities and compare these parameters in different phenotypes of adolescent PCOS cases. It is a hospital-based cross-sectional study among 248 adolescent girls (10-19 years) with menstrual irregularities. After obtaining informed consent, history and clinical examination findings were recorded on preform proforma. All girls were assessed on day 2/3 of the menstrual cycle for hormonal profile (serum TSH, FSH, LH, prolactin, and serum testosterone) and ovarian morphology (by transabdominal ultrasonography). All participating girls were divided into three groups (groups 1, 2, and 3) corresponding to phenotypes A, B, & D as per the Rotterdam criteria. In the study, oligomenorrhea was the most common menstrual disorder (70.97%). Biochemical hyperandrogenism and thyroid dysfunction were reported in 14.91% and 8.46% of girls, respectively. Our study noted that phenotype D ,i.e., group 3 (MI + PCOM-HA; 49.43%) was the most common phenotype in the study. In a comparative analysis of different groups, significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in hormonal and metabolic parameters showed highest in group 2, which represents phenotype B of PCOS (hyperandrogenic anovulation). This analysis revealed that adolescent hyperandrogenism (phenotypes A and B) is associated with a more deranged hormonal and metabolic profile than nonandrogenic PCOS (phenotype D). To prevent long-term sequelae, lifestyle changes, early treatment, and close follow-up are recommended in this subset of girls.",['Patel S; Pushpalatha K; Singh B; Shrisvastava R; Singh G; Dabar D'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35874845,"menstrual disturbances are common among adolescents with a prevalence rate of 11.3-26.7%. the most frequent menstrual irregularities are oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, polymenorrhoea, and hypomenorrhea.

The correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Menstruation serves as an indicator of women's reproductive well-being and plays a pivotal role in their fertility; nevertheless, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the epidemiological evidence linking menstrual characteristics as well as fertility. To explore the correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane libraries to identify research articles published up until February 9, 2024. We included all studies in which the relationship between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy rates among women of reproductive age was investigated. We excluded studies involving the administration of oral contraceptives, the application of assisted reproductive technologies, and individuals with a documented history of infertility or partners with a known history of infertility. Clinical pregnancy and miscarriage. This meta-analysis was composed of nine studies involving a total of 399,966 women, and the evidential quality derived from these studies was deemed to be high with a low risk of bias. Compared with a normal menstrual cycle length (25-32 days), the impact of a short (<25 days) or long (>32 days) menstrual cycle on a woman's pregnancy was relatively insignificant ([odds ratio {OR}, 0.81; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65-1.01; I<sup>2</sup>, 68%]; [OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.06; I<sup>2</sup>, 60%], respectively); however, a change in cycle length may increase the risk of miscarriage ([relative risk, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.15; I<sup>2</sup>, 0]; [relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.57; I<sup>2</sup>, 43%], respectively). In comparison to women experiencing menarche at a typical age (12-14 years), those with a late age at menarche (>14 years) exhibited a decreased likelihood of pregnancy (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.91-0.93; I<sup>2</sup>, 0%); and compared with women experiencing a normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4-7 days), those with a short duration of menstrual bleeding (<4 days) exhibited reduced fertility potential (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.88; I<sup>2</sup>, 29%). Short and long menstrual cycle lengths may elevate women's susceptibility to spontaneous abortion, whereas late age at menarche as well as short duration of menstrual bleeding appear to be linked to diminished fertility among women of reproductive age.

Relationship between menarche and fertility in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis).,"We attempted to elucidate female reproduction in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). These monkeys have a non-seasonal menstruation cycle, which makes them suitable subjects for studies in a variety fields including medical science and regenerative medicine. We analyzed individual breeding data including time of menarche, start of regular menstruation, and first pregnancy. These three events are related to the maturation of female long-tailed macaques. All research subjects were female long-tailed macaques bred at the Tsukuba Primate Research Center. The study comprised 45 females; we included time of menstruation, male-female cohabitation, and first pregnancy in their growth records. We extracted age and weight data relating to menarche, start of regular menstruation, and first pregnancy from these records. In the two years typically required from menarche to first pregnancy, the body weight increased by approximately 500 g (21% of the weight at menarche); it is clear that there is a significant physical change after menarche. Our findings suggest that female monkeys are not necessarily mature enough for pregnancy at menarche. Therefore, the use of the word ""maturity"" in terms of fecundity may be more accurate after the start of regular menstruation. This is what we term ""adolescence"" in the developmental process. Therefore, M. fascicularis monkeys are candidates for an animal model of human adolescence.",['Kobayashi M; Koyama T; Yasutomi Y; Sankai T'],2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29848903,elucidates female reproduction in long-tailed macaques. the monkeys have a non-seasonal menstruation cycle. they are suitable subjects for studies in a variety fields.
"Adolescent girls' descriptions of dysmenorrhea and barriers to dysmenorrhea management in Moshi, Tanzania: A qualitative study.","Dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) is common among adolescent girls globally, but many girls in Sub-Saharan Africa do not receive effective treatment. Qualitative interviews were used to describe adolescent girls' experiences of dysmenorrhea and identify sociocultural barriers to dysmenorrhea management in Moshi, Tanzania. From August to November 2018, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 adolescent girls and 10 adult experts (e.g., teachers, medical providers) who have experience working with girls in Tanzania. Thematic content analysis identified themes related to dysmenorrhea, including descriptions of dysmenorrhea and the impact of dysmenorrhea on well-being, as well as factors influencing the use of pharmacological and behavioral pain management strategies. Potential barriers to dysmenorrhea management were identified. Dysmenorrhea negatively impacted the physical and psychological well-being of girls and hindered girls' ability to participate in school, work, and social events. The most common pain management strategies were resting, drinking hot water, engaging in physical activity, and taking paracetamol. Barriers to dysmenorrhea management included beliefs that medications are harmful to the body or can hinder fertility, limited knowledge about the benefits of hormonal contraceptives to manage menstruation, little continuing education for healthcare providers, and a lack of consistent access to effective medications, medical care, or other supplies necessary for pain management. Medication hesitancy and inconsistent access to effective medication and other menstrual supplies must be addressed to improve girls' ability to manage dysmenorrhea in Tanzania.",['Cherenack EM; Rubli J; Melara A; Ezaldein N; King A; Alcaide ML; Raccamarich P; Fein LA; Sikkema KJ'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37410763,a qualitative study was conducted with 10 adolescent girls and 10 adult experts. thematic content analysis identified themes related to dysmenorrhea. dysmenorrhea negatively impacted the physical and psychological well-being of girls.

The aim of the study was to look at the health and welfare needs of women seafarers and how organisations can best make or campaign for improvements to the health information and services available to women seafarers. A pilot study was conducted in July 2014 and following review of the data and revision of the questionnaire the study was launched in December 2014, running until the middle of March 2015. Results collected from the survey are also supported by qualitative data obtained from two focus groups run during February and March. 595 responses were received from a range of nationalities, ages and positions on board ships. The findings suggest that joint/back pain, stress/depression/anxiety and headache seem to be the most common symptoms reported by women seafarers and that 55% felt that they are related to their work. 48% state that they have problems with seeking medical care and offer suggestions to improve this. Routine wellness checks, nutrition and information on joint and back pain are the main areas that women seafarers stated health screening/services/information would be most useful to improve their health and wellbeing. They suggested this could best be received directly from health professionals, or alternatively by reading leaflets or from online websites/an app. Significantly 37% of women seafarers also stated that they do not have access to sanitary bins within the toilet and 18% say that sexual harassment is an issue. The responses received highlight a small number of areas where relatively simple and low-cost interventions might improve the health and welfare of women seafarers. Specifically these include the production and appropriate distribution of gender-specific information on back pain, mental health and nutrition in addition to gynaecological complaints, to all women seafarers; the introduction of means for disposing of sanitary waste for all female crew on all ships and the improved availability of female specific products e.g. sanitary products in port shops and welfare centres worldwide. Additional work is needed to investigate these areas more fully and to look at the issue of confidence in medically trained staff, medical confidentiality and sexual harassment. Any further work and interventions will require the support of all of the main stakeholders and we plan a briefing meeting to publicise the findings to date and to identify support for further work in this area.",['Stannard S; Vaughan C; Swift O; Robinson G; Altaf SA; McGarry A'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394312,"women seafarers' health and welfare survey launched in august 2014. the study was carried out by the international Maritime health association. 595 responses were received from a range of nationalities, ages and positions on board ships."
The role of art therapy on quality of life of women with recent pregnancy loss: A randomized clinical trial.,"Pregnancy loss and mourning can lead to psychological adverse effects on women's quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of art therapy on the quality of life of women with pregnancy loss. This study was a randomized clinical trial performed on 60 women who recently experienced abortion or stillbirth. After randomization in two groups (30 in each group), women in the intervention group received four session art therapy. In the control group, routine care was performed. The Perinatal Grief Scale and World Health Organization quality of life questionnaire, short version 26, was used to collect data before and eight weeks after intervention, and the result was compared before and after the intervention in both groups. The mean age of participants was 26.5±4.75 years. Eight weeks after the intervention, the mean score of the total quality of life was significantly different between the two groups (348.64±13.12 vs.254.46±58.35; P>0.01). Also, all physical, psychological, social, and environmental dimensions of quality of life improved in the art therapy group compared to the control group (P>0.01). Art therapy could improve the quality-of-life following pregnancy loss, and can be recommended as a complementary method next to routine care.

Menstrual poverty scale: reliability and validity study.,"The tendency toward poverty in the globalizing world significantly affects women. Unlike men, women have mandatory expenses every month. Especially poor women have difficulty in accessing to the hygienic products they need during the menstrual period. That is why, this study aims to develop a measurement tool that can effectively and widely assess women's menstrual poverty. This study is a methodological study that evaluates the psychometric properties of the scale. The study included 420 women living in a middle-income province in the north of Türkiye between April - July, 2023. The data were collected using the Menstrual Poverty Scale, and the items on the scale were developed based on a review of existing literature and expert opinions (CVI = 0.85-0.95). The sample was divided into two parts. It was made exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Before conducting the study, an ethics committee decision and informed consent of the women were obtained. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS 23 and AMOS 23 programs. The EFA revealed a structure consisting of 13 items and four factors. The four factors considered were as follows; access to hygiene products, quality of life, embarrassment, and receiving information, and education about menstruation. The item factor loadings varied from 0.46 to 0.91. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was determined to be 0.69. The corrected item-total correlations for the scale items ranged from 0.62 to 0.84. According to the confirmatory factor analysis, the structural equation modeling results of the Menstrual Poverty Scale were found to be meaningful (<i>p</i> = .000; RMSEA 0.64; CMIN/Df 1.70).

[Local estrogen therapy--clinical implications--2012 update].,"With increasing longevity in Poland, women can now expect to live around 40% of their lives after menopause, and there is a growing desire for older women to preserve their vitality sexual function and quality of life. The most common urogenital symptoms associated with menopause are dryness, followed by irritation or itching, and discharge, with a substantial number of post-menopausal women also being affected by dysuria. These symptoms are the result of vaginal atrophy which is in turn caused by reduced transudation through the vaginal epithelium and reduced cervical gland secretions resulting from post-menopausal estrogen depletion. Vaginal atrophy generally occurs 4-5 years after the last menstrual period and progressively increases in prevalence in the subsequent years. Importantly vaginal atrophy is strongly associated with sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract symptoms, such as frequency urgency nocturia and dysuria, as well as incontinence and recurrent infection are reported more frequently in the presence of vaginal atrophy Those symptoms, apart from being bothersome for the patients also negatively impact their quality of life. Consequently before irreversible changes occur, early detection and treatment of vaginal atrophy should be implemented. Estrogen therapy is the most commonly prescribed treatment. Estrogens restore the cytology pH and vascularity of the vagina, resulting in symptom resolution for the majority of treated women. Because vaginal atrophy symptoms tend to occur later than vasomotor symptoms, many women do not necessarily require or wish to take systemic estrogen treatment if their symptoms are restricted to the urogenital tract. Vaginal estrogen products deliver estrogen locally to vaginal tissues with little or no systemic absorption and provide an effective alternative to systemic estrogen therapy for these women. Various vaginal estrogen preparations such as conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol and estriol vaginal creams, a sustained-release intra-vaginal estradiol ring and a low-dose estradiol and estriol tablets are useful therapeutic options in the treatment of this condition. Moreover; a low dose treatment with a minimised systemic absorption rate may be considered in women with a history of breast cancer and associated severe vulvovaginal atrophy. It should be mentioned that vaginal lubricants once applied on a regular basis may also be effective in alleviating the symptoms of vaginal atrophy and should be offered to women wishing to avoid the use of local vaginal estrogen preparations and in cases where local estrogen therapy is contraindicated. Vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal testosterone, and tissue selective estrogen complexes are new, emerging therapies; however more clinical studies are necessary to confirm their efficacy and safety in the treatment of postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy.",['Kokot-Kierepa M; Bartuzi A; Kulik-Rechberger B; Rechberger T'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23383564,"women can expect to live around 40% of their lives after menopause. most common urogenital symptoms associated with menopause are dryness, irritation or itching, and discharge. a substantial number of post-menopausal women also affected by dysuria."
[Psychological factors influencing the experience of menstrual pain - the role of pain catastrophizing].,"Research on menstrual pain is lacking in the literature in terms of the number of people affected, the amount of time spent suffering, and the consequences. We examined the role of pain catastrophizing in experiencing the subjective extent and frequency of menstrual pain and its perception as a limitation to daily activities. In our study, during personal tests between 2015 and 2018, we collected data from around 1000 healthy women aged 18 to 51 years, predominantly with secondary and higher education, already and still menstruating, mostly living in a large city, mainly in a relationship, perceiving themselves to be in excellent or good health, predominantly not using hormonal contraceptives, mostly having a regular menstrual cycle. We used an open-ended question to measure the extent, frequency, and impact on daily activities of menstrual pain, and used the Pain Catastrophizing Questionnaire. In our own sample, we found that the more the subject ""tends"" to report pain catastrophizing, the stronger is the menstrual pain she reports, the more often she experiences menstrual pain and says that the pain limits her daily activities. The results showed that it is worth examining the personality characteristics among the factors influencing the extent of menstrual pain; the results can be incorporated into diagnostic and therapeutic work.

Drivers of breast cancer and cervical cancer screening among women of reproductive age: insights from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey.,"The two major causes of cancer-related deaths among women in Ghana are breast cancer (BC) and cervical cancer (CC). These types of cancers typically do not show any symptoms until they have progressed. Therefore, it is important to screen for early detection. This research aimed to investigate the rate of breast cancer and cervical cancer screening, as well as the factors associated with it, among women of reproductive age in Ghana. This study analysed data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. A total of 15,014 women aged 15 to 49 years were included in the analysis. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were employed to analyse the data with the aid of STATA/SE, version 17. It was found that 18.4% and 5.0% of the women had screened for BC and CC, respectively. Women aged 45-49 years were about three times more likely (aOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.88-4.24) to screen for BC compared to those aged 15-19 years. Women who had tested for HIV had increased odds (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.56-2.25) of screening for BC compared to their counterparts. Women within the richest wealth index (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.40-2.72) had increased odds of screening for BC compared to those in the poorest wealth index. Regarding CC screening, women with higher education (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.53-4.29) were two times more likely to screen for CC compared to those with no formal education. Women who did not use tobacco (aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.96) had decreased odds of CC screening compared to their counterparts. This study showed that the uptake of BC and CC screening services among women in Ghana was very low. The drivers of BC and CC screening included enabling, predisposing, and need factors. Stakeholders can leverage the mass media to raise awareness and educate women in reproductive age about the importance of BC and CC screening.

Computer-Based Experiment for the Motion of Spring Oscillator on a Linear Air Track Using Ultrasonic Sensor.,"In the present paper, an affordable innovative physical experimental equipment consisting of an upper computer, an ultrasonic sensor module, and an Arduino microcontroller has been designed. The relationship between the position of the slider fixed on two springs and time is measured by using the ultrasonic sensor module. A system for slider motion data and image acquisition is constructed by using the LabVIEW interface of Arduino UNO R3. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate and interpret the propagation of waves represented by harmonic motion. The spring oscillator system including a slider and two springs is measured and recorded, and the motion can be realized using curve fitting to the wave equation in Sigmaplot. The vibration periods obtained from experimental measurements and curve fitting of the wave equation are 1.130 s and 1.165 s, respectively. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical model. The experimental measurement results show that the maximum kinetic energy is 0.0792 J, the maximum potential energy is 0.0795 J, and the total energy at the position of half the amplitude is 0.0791 J. The results verify the mechanical energy conservation of spring oscillator system in a short time. This self-made instrument has improved the visualization and the automation level of the corresponding experiments.",['Wu B; Xu Y; Zhou G; Fan Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39065838,an affordable physical experimental equipment has been designed. the spring oscillator system includes a slider and two springs is measured. the motion can be realized using curve fitting to the wave equation.
"Safety and efficacy of the selective progesterone receptor modulator asoprisnil for heavy menstrual bleeding with uterine fibroids: pooled analysis of two 12-month, placebo-controlled, randomized trials.","Can asoprisnil, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, provide clinically meaningful improvements in heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids with an acceptable safety profile? Uninterrupted treatment with asoprisnil for 12 months effectively controlled HMB and reduced fibroid and uterine volume with few adverse events. In a 3-month study, asoprisnil (5, 10 and 25 mg) suppressed uterine bleeding, reduced fibroid and uterine volume, and improved hematological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. In two Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies, women received oral asoprisnil 10 mg, asoprisnil 25 mg or placebo (2:2:1) once daily for up to 12 months. Premenopausal women ≥18 years of age in North America with HMB associated with uterine fibroids were included (N = 907). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of women who met all three predefined criteria at 12 months or the final month for patients who prematurely discontinued: (1) ≥50% reduction in monthly blood loss (MBL) by menstrual pictogram, (2) hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dL or an increase of ≥1 g/dL, and (3) no interventional therapy for uterine fibroids. Secondary efficacy endpoints included changes in other menstrual bleeding parameters, volume of the largest fibroids, uterine volume and health-related quality of life (HRQL). In all, 90% and 93% of women in the asoprisnil 10-mg and 25-mg groups, respectively, and 35% of women in the placebo group met the primary endpoint (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed at month 6 (P < 0.001). The percentage of women who achieved amenorrhea in any specified month ranged from 66-78% in the asoprisnil 10-mg group and 83-93% in the asoprisnil 25-mg group, significantly higher than with placebo (3-12%, P < 0.001). Hemoglobin increased rapidly (by month 2) with asoprisnil treatment and was significantly higher versus placebo throughout treatment. The primary fibroid and uterine volumes were significantly reduced from baseline through month 12 with asoprisnil 10 mg (median changes up to -48% and -28%, respectively) and 25 mg (median changes up to -63% and -39%, respectively) versus placebo (median changes up to +16% and +13%, respectively; all P < 0.001). Dose-dependent, significant improvements in HRQL (Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life instrument) were observed with asoprisnil treatment. Asoprisnil was generally well tolerated. Endometrial biopsies indicated dose- and time-dependent decreases in proliferative patterns and increases in quiescent or minimally stimulated endometrium at month 12 of treatment. Although not statistically significantly different at month 6, mean endometrial thickness at month 12 increased by ~2 mm in both asoprisnil groups compared with placebo (P < 0.01). This effect was associated with cystic changes in the endometrium on MRI and ultrasonography, which led to invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in some asoprisnil-treated women. Most study participants were black; few Asian and Hispanic women participated. The study duration may have been insufficient to fully characterize the endometrial effects. Daily uninterrupted treatment with asoprisnil was highly effective in controlling menstrual bleeding, improving anemia, reducing fibroid and uterine volume, and increasing HRQL in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids. However, this treatment led to an increase in endometrial thickness and invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with potential unknown consequences. This trial was funded by AbbVie Inc.

Medical abortion: overview and management.,"Medical abortion regimens are safe, effective, and offer a new range of choices for patients and providers. In September 2000, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol, which effects abortion by luteolysis, uterine contractions, and expulsion of the products of conception without surgical instrumentation. The regimen requires that a provider be capable of diagnosing ectopic gestations and be able to make arrangements for a surgical abortion in the case of failure or medical emergencies. With a medical abortion, the pregnancy is passed spontaneously, and there may not be tissue obtained for confirmation. Physicians must be aware of their state requirements with regard to expulsed tissue examination. Completion of the procedure can be established by ultrasound or by measurement of serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The FDA-approved protocol allows for use up to 49 days after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and consists of mifepristone 600 mg orally on day 1, misoprostol 400 mcg orally on day 3, and a follow-up appointment on days 12-20. Half of all patients pass their pregnancy in the first few hours after the second visit. It is important to be able to determine the difference between expected bleeding, 14 days on average, and the complication of hemorrhage, as 2% to 10% of patients require a surgical abortion. Continuing viable pregnancies are rare. Several other regimens can safely expand options and reduce expense, including protocols using methotrexate. Medication indications and contraindications, management strategies for patients undergoing treatment with these regimens, and safety issues are reviewed.",['Trupin SR; Moreno C'],2001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11965218,"mifepristone and misoprostol are effective and effective. the regimen requires a provider be capable of diagnosing ectopic gestations. the pregnancy is passed spontaneously, and there may not be tissue obtained for confirmation."
"The Impact of Menstrual Cycle Phases on Cardiac Autonomic Nervous System Activity: An Observational Study Considering Lifestyle (Diet, Physical Activity, and Sleep) among Female College Students.","Studies examining the impact of menstrual cycle phases on the cardiac autonomic nervous system have produced inconsistent results. This study aimed to investigate this relationship, controlling for the confounding effects of diet, physical activity, and sleep, which can be affected by the menstrual cycle. Fifteen female college students with regular menses were enrolled. Data regarding 24-h heart rate variability (HRV), dietary intake, eating behavior, menstrual distress, and sleep and activity parameters were obtained during the follicular and luteal phases. Power spectral analysis of HRV was used to calculate low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz, LF), high-frequency (>0.15 Hz, HF), and total spectral power (TP). Cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity indicators were evaluated as LF/HF and HF/TP, respectively. Intake of protein and fat, as well as total sleep time and number of awakenings, were higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (p<0.05). Tendencies for increased mean activity counts, emotional eating scores, and behavioral change scores in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire were observed in the luteal phase (p<0.10). Although LF/HF was higher in the luteal phase (p=0.036), the relationship was weakened after controlling for diet, physical activity, and sleep (p=0.113). Our findings suggest that altering sympathetic nervous system activity during the menstrual cycle was not independent from major lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity, and sleep). Menstrual cycle phase and changes of these parameters should be considered when assessing the cardiac autonomic function among menstruating woman.",['Tada Y; Yoshizaki T; Tomata Y; Yokoyama Y; Sunami A; Hida A; Kawano Y'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978872,"study examining the impact of menstrual cycle phases on the cardiac autonomic nervous system. study aims to investigate the relationship between diet, physical activity, and sleep."

Sex-dependent effects of an Hnrnph1 mutation on fentanyl addiction-relevant behaviors but not antinociception in mice.,"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and opioid-related deaths remain a major public health concern in the United States. Both environmental and genetic factors influence risk for OUD. We previously identified Hnrnph1 as a quantitative trait gene underlying the stimulant, rewarding, and reinforcing properties of methamphetamine. Prior work shows that hnRNP H1, the RNA-binding protein encoded by Hnrnph1, post-transcriptionally regulates Oprm1 (mu opioid receptor gene)-the primary molecular target for the therapeutic and addictive properties of opioids. Because genetic variants can exert pleiotropic effects on behaviors induced by multiple drugs of abuse, in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that Hnrnph1 mutants would show reduced behavioral sensitivity to the mu opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. Hnrnph1 mutants showed reduced sensitivity to fentanyl-induced locomotor activity, along with a female-specific reduction in, and a male-specific induction of, locomotor sensitization following three, daily injections (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Hnrnph1 mutants also required a higher dose of fentanyl to exhibit opioid reward as measured via conditioned place preference (CPP). Male Hnrnph1 mutants showed reduced fentanyl reinforcement. Hnrnph1 mutants also showed reduced sucrose motivation, suggesting a reward deficit. No genotypic differences were observed in baseline thermal nociception, fentanyl-induced antinociception, physical or negative affective signs of opioid dependence, or in sensorimotor gating. In the context of our prior work, these findings suggest that Hnrnph1 dysfunction exerts a selective role in reducing the addiction liability to drugs of abuse (opioids and psychostimulants), which could provide new biological pathways to improve their therapeutic profiles.",['Bryant CD; Healy AF; Ruan QT; Coehlo MA; Lustig E; Yazdani N; Luttik KP; Tran T; Swancy I; Brewin LW; Chen MM; Szumlinski KK'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33145940,hnrnph1 mutants showed reduced behavioral sensitivity to fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. males also required a higher dose of fentanyl to exhibit opioid reward.
Gender differences in cancer susceptibility: role of oxidative stress.,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and environmental factors, including chemicals, have been suggested as major etiological incitements. Cancer statistics indicates that men get more cancer than women. However, differences in the known risk factors including life style or occupational exposure only offer partial explanation. Using a text mining tool, we have investigated the scientific literature concerning male- and female-specific rat carcinogens that induced tumors only in one gender in NTP 2-year cancer bioassay. Our evaluation shows that oxidative stress, although frequently reported for both male- and female-specific rat carcinogens, was mentioned significantly more in literature concerning male-specific rat carcinogens. Literature analysis of testosterone and estradiol showed the same pattern. Tox21 high-throughput assay results, although showing only weak association of oxidative stress-related processes for male- and female-specific rat carcinogens, provide additional support. We also analyzed the literature concerning 26 established human carcinogens (IARC group 1). Oxidative stress was more frequently reported for the majority of these carcinogens, and the Tox21 data resembled that of male-specific rat carcinogens. Thus, our data, based on about 600000 scientific abstracts and Tox21 screening assays, suggest a link between male-specific carcinogens, testosterone and oxidative stress. This implies that a different cellular response to oxidative stress in men and women may be a critical factor in explaining the greater cancer susceptibility observed in men. Although the IARC carcinogens are classified as human carcinogens, their classification largely based on epidemiological evidence from male cohorts, which raises the question whether carcinogen classifications should be gender specific.",['Ali I; Högberg J; Hsieh JH; Auerbach S; Korhonen A; Stenius U; Silins I'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27481070,oxidative stress was mentioned significantly more in literature concerning male- and female-specific rat carcinogens. oxidative stress was more frequently reported for the majority of these carcinogens.
Quality of life in women with bleeding disorders.,"The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has been increasingly used over the last years, is regarded one of the most relevant health outcome measures and is included as secondary and primary endpoint in clinical and observational trials. Bleeding disorders and their treatment impact on patients' HRQOL, especially in women with bleeding disorders and can affect the everyday life of patients and their families. In women with inherited bleeding disorders, menorrhagia is the most common symptom, manifest by significant bleeding and pain leading to limitation in conducting daily activities and changes in social functioning with an adverse effect on women's HRQOL. Only few studies used validated questionnaires for the assessment of HRQOL in women with bleeding disorders, mainly generic instruments. Few disease-specific instruments are available for the adequate assessment of the impact of menorrhagia on HRQOL, namely the Ruta Menorrhagia Severity Scale, the menorrhagia multi-attribute utility scale and the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire. The von Willebrand disease (VWD)-QOL questionnaire, a disease-specific questionnaire for patients with VWD contains a specific dimension 'menstruation' for women. These studies revealed that menorrhagia has a larger impact on HRQOL in women with inherited bleeding disorders compared with women with normal haemostasis. Moreover, age, type of VWD and gender have an influence on the HRQOL of patients with VWD. The need of disease-specific instruments for an adequate assessment of HRQOL in women with bleeding disorders could be demonstrated in these studies.",['Von Mackensen S'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21692927,"menorrhagia is the most common symptom, manifest by significant bleeding and pain leading to limitation in conducting daily activities. only few studies used validated questionnaires for the assessment of HRQOL in women with bleeding disorders."
Female Reproductive Health and Contraception Use in CKD: An International Mixed-Methods Study.,"Female reproductive health is recognized as a predictor of morbidity, mortality, and quality of life, although data in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are limited. A mixed-methods study was employed. Phase 1 was an anonymous, internet-based survey. Phase 2 was semistructured interviews offered to all respondents upon survey completion. The survey was disseminated internationally from October 4, 2021, to January 7, 2022, to individuals aged 18-50 years with both a uterus and CKD diagnosis. Menstrual health and contraceptive use by CKD stage (dialysis, nondialysis CKD, and transplant). Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interview data were analyzed using the framework method of analysis. Of 152 respondents, 98 (mean age 33 ± 0.7 years; n = 20 dialysis, n = 59 nondialysis CKD, n = 19 transplant) satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing 3 continents. The most common causes of CKD among survey respondents were hereditary causes in dialysis (n = 6, 30%) and glomerulonephritis in nondialysis CKD (n = 22, 37%) and transplant (n = 6, 32%). The majority reported heavy menstrual bleeding (n = 12, 86% dialysis; n = 46, 94% nondialysis CKD; n = 14, 100% transplant). Less than half of participants were consistently able to afford period products. Condoms were the most common contraceptive reported. Most participants reported no contraceptive use (n = 10, 50% dialysis; n = 37, 63% nondialysis CKD; n = 7, 37% transplant), primarily because of ""fear"". Interviews (n = 6) revealed a perception of a relationship between kidney function and menstrual health, concerns about contraceptive use, and a desire for greater multidisciplinary care to improve kidney and reproductive health. Self-reported outcomes, need for internet access and a device. Abnormal menstruation and period poverty (ie, inability to afford period products and the socioeconomic consequences of menstruation) were common, and contraceptive use was low among female individuals with CKD, highlighting an important gap in the sex-specific care of this population. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in female individuals is accompanied by menstrual disorders and low contraceptive use. However, most data are limited to the dialysis and transplant populations. Therefore, this mixed-methods study aimed to describe self-assessed menstruation and contraceptive use across all stages of CKD. People aged 18-50 years with a uterus and CKD diagnosis were invited to participate in an online survey shared internationally as well as an optional telephone interview.

Nonlinear adaptive pose motion control of a servicer spacecraft in approximation with an accelerated tumbling target.,"Removing a limited number of large debris can significantly reduce space debris risks. These bodies are generally exposed to extreme environmental disturbance torques or consecutive accidents due to their large wet area, which causes them to experience accelerated high-rate tumbling motion. The existing literature has adequately explored the approximation operations with non-cooperative targets exhibiting 3-axis tumbling motion. However, the research gap lies in the lack of attention given to addressing this approximation for targets undergoing accelerated motion. Agile, accurate, and large-angle maneuvers are three common necessities for safely capturing such targets. Changes in the moment of inertia brought on by fuel slushing cannot be disregarded during such a maneuver. To deal with nonlinearities, adverse coupling effects, actuator saturation constraints, time-varying moment of inertia, and external disturbances that worsen during accelerated agile large-angle maneuvers, a novel adaptive control approach is developed in this paper. The controller's main advantage is its adjustable desired acceleration, which maintains its performance even when dealing with accelerated motion. The control law is directly synthesized from the nonlinear relative equations of motion, without any linearization or simplification of the system dynamics, making it robust to a variety of orbital elements and target behaviors. Adaptation laws are extracted from the Lyapunov stability theorem in a way that guarantees asymptotic stability. Moreover, control actuator roles (delay, saturation, and allocation) are accounted for in modeling and simulation. Finally, a comprehensive numerical simulation based on three different realistic and strict scenarios is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control approach. The controller's robustness against time-varying dynamic parameters (sharp and sudden change, smooth and slow change, and periodic change) is extensively demonstrated through simulation.",['Kasiri A; Fani Saberi F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38942822,nonlinear adaptive pose motion control of a servicer spacecraft is developed. the controller's main advantage is its adjustable desired acceleration. the control law is directly synthesized from the nonlinear relative equations of motion.
A 36-year-old lady with type three female genital mutilation (Infibulation) - its long-term complications: a case report and literature review.,"Female genital mutilation comprises all procedures involving the partial or total removal of female external genitalia or other injury to the female external organs, whether for religious, cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons. The impact of female genital mutilation is diverse, including physical, social and psychological impact. We report a case of a 36-year-old woman with type three female genital mutilation who did not seek medical treatment due to lack of awareness that there was treatment for it, and use this case as an entry point to comprehensively review literature regarding long-term complications associated with female genital mutilation and its impact on women's quality of life. We present a case of a 36-year-old single nulligravida lady with type three female genital mutilation who had presented with difficulty with urination since childhood. She had difficulty with menstruation since her menarche, and she had never had sexual intercourse. She never sought treatment, but recently went to hospital after she heard of a young lady who had the same problem in her neighborhood who was treated surgically and got married. On external genitalia examination, there was no clitoris, no labia minora, and labia majora were fused to each other with a healed old scar between them. There was a 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm opening below the fused labia majora near to the anus through which urine was dribbling. De-infibulation was done. Six months after the procedure, she was married and at that moment she was pregnant. The physical, sexual, obstetrics and psychosocial consequences of female genital mutilation are neglected issues. The improvement of women's socio-cultural status in combination with planning programs to enhance their information and awareness as well as trying to change the cultural and religious leaders' viewpoints regarding this procedure is essential to reducing female genital mutilation and its burden on women's health.",['Jidha TD; Feyissa AK'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37147647,"female genital mutilation comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of female external genitalia or other injury to the female external organs. the impact of female genital mutilation is diverse, including physical, social and psychological impact."
Characterization of the GU microbiome in women with self-perceived bladder health over the life course.,"A variety of factors influence bladder health, including environmental factors, life experiences, biologic foundations, and coexistent medical conditions. A biologically diverse microbial community exists in the urine that is likely influenced by the microbial inhabitants of the vagina. The relationship between the genitourinary (GU) microbiome and self-perceived bladder health is unknown. To longitudinally define the GU microbiome in women with self-percieved bladder health sampled across multiple time points over a year. Women with no reported lower urinary tract dysfunction or symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from six clinical sites and assessed every 6 weeks for 1 year. Voided urine and vaginal samples were longitudinally collected. Self-perceived bladder health was assessed with select items from the LURN comprehensive assessment of self-reported urinary symptoms (CASUS) tool. We defined four life phases as follows: young (18-34 years, nulliparous), midlife (35-45 years, menstruating), transitional (46-60 years, perimenopausal), mature (>60 years, not using vaginal and/or systemic hormone replacement therapy). DNA was extracted from samples, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with region-specific primers. The 16S rRNA sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq. Microbial beta-diversity was calculated using DEICODE to identify microbial taxa that cluster in the samples. Longitudinal volatility analysis was performed using the gemelli plugin. Log-abundance ratios of microbial features were explored and visualized in Qurro. Fifty-four (N = 16 young, N = 16 midlife, N = 15 transitional, N = 7 mature) women were enrolled and provided baseline data. Most women in each life phase (93%-98%) continued to report self-perceived bladder health throughout the 1-year follow-up as assessed by CASUS items. Temporal-based microbial diversity of urinary and vaginal microbiome remained relatively stable over 1 year in all subjects. The GU microbiomes of mature women were distinct and microbially diverse from that of young, midlife, and transitional women, with genera of Gardnerella, Cupriavidus, and Dialister contributory to the microbial features of the mature microbiome. The mature GU microbiome was statistically different (p < 0.0001) from the midlife, transitional, and young microbiome for the log ratio of Gardnerella and Cupriavidus (in the numerator) and Lactobacillus (in the denominator) for voided samples and Gardnerella and Dialister (in the numerator) and Lactobacillus (in the denominator) for vaginal samples. Differences in the GU microbiome were also demonstrated via longitudinal beta-diversity between women developing urinary frequency as reported by CASUS responses or objectively on bladder diary compared to women without urinary frequency. In women with a self-perceived healthy bladder, the GU microbiome remained stable in all age groups over a 1 year period. Differences were seen with respect to life phase, where mature women were distinct from all other groups, and with respect to self-reported LUTS.",['Mueller MG; Das P; Andy U; Dieter AA; Dwarica D; Kirby AC; Shepherd JP; Gregory WT; Amundsen CL; Kenton K'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36259770,a biologically diverse microbial community exists in the urine that is likely influenced by the microbial inhabitants of the vagina. a biologically diverse microbial community exists in the urine that is likely influenced by the microbial inhabitants of the vagina.
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pattern of Antibiotic and Opioid Prescriptions by Dentists in Alberta, Canada.","After the shutdown of most dental services during the COVID-19 lockdown, the oral health community was concerned about an increase in prescribing opioids and antibiotics by dentists due to patients' limited access to dental offices. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of antibiotic and opioid prescriptions by dentists in Alberta, Canada. Data obtained from the Tracked Prescription Program were divided into antibiotics and opioids. Time periods were outlined as pre-, during-, and postlockdown (phase 1 and 2). For the number of prescriptions and average supply, each monthly average was compared to the corresponding prelockdown monthly average, using descriptive analysis. Time series analyses were conducted using regression analyses with an autoregressive error model. Data were trained and tested on monthly observations before lockdown and predicted for during- and postlockdown. A total of 1.1 million antibiotics and 400,000 opioids dispense were tracked. Decreases in the number of prescriptions during lockdown presented for antibiotics (n = 24,933 vs. 18,884) and opioids (n = 8892 vs. 6051). Average supplies (days) for the antibiotics (n = 7.10 vs. 7.55) and opioids (n = 3.92 vs. 4.05) were higher during the lockdown period. In the trend analyses, the monthly number of antibiotic and opioid prescriptions showed the same pattern and decreased during lockdown. The COVID-19 pandemic altered the trends of prescribing antibiotics and opioids by dentists. The full impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the population's oral health in light of changes in prescribing practices by dentists during and after lockdown warrants further investigation.",['Immel R; Bohlouli B; Amin M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38973213,"data obtained from the Tracked Prescription Program were divided into antibiotics and opioids. time periods were outlined as pre-, during-, and postlockdown."
[Features of pain syndrome in vertebrogenic pathology in women].,"Pain syndrome is one of the important problems faced by women, and its treatment requires an integrated approach, taking into account the individual characteristics of the female body. Currently, several hypotheses have been formulated to explain sex differences in the perception of pain, but they all have a number of contradictions. It has been established that pain syndrome occurs more often in women than in men and its prevalence increases with age. The characteristics of pain syndrome in women are based on hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, changes associated with pregnancy, menopause, anatomical aspects, as well as psycho-social factors. An analysis of studies of non-drug methods of treating vertebrogenic pain syndrome (acupuncture, manual therapy, physical methods) is presented from the point of view of sex differences in their effectiveness. In female patients, the effectiveness of such therapy is shown to be generally higher than in men, and the percentage of pain relapses is lower. Also, women are more likely than men to use methods to prevent chronic pain syndrome. The features of vertebrogenic pain syndrome during pregnancy, as well as the effectiveness of medical and surgical treatment methods in patients of both sexes, are separately considered. Thus, taking into account the individual characteristics of vertebrogenic pain syndrome and its response to various treatment methods in women contributes to the development of effective comprehensive rehabilitation programs for this category of patients.",['Kicherova OA; Klimov GJ; Reikhert LI; Skrjabin EG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38884425,"pain syndrome occurs more often in women than in men and its prevalence increases with age. characteristics of pain syndrome in women are based on hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, changes associated with pregnancy, menopause, anatomical aspects, as well as psycho-social factors."
Prevalence and correlates of menstrual hygiene practices among young currently married women aged 15-24 years: an analysis from a nationally representative survey of India.,"This paper aims to investigate the prevalence by geographical locations and socio-demographic correlates of menstrual hygienic practices among young currently married Indian women. The study is based on secondary data, collected from the latest round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), conducted in 2015-16. A total of 94,034 young currently married women aged 15-24 years were utilised in this study. The prevalence of menstrual hygienic practices was portrayed across regions, states, and districts of India. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the factors associated with menstrual hygienic practices. Nearly half of the women (49.3%) practice hygienic methods to contain menstrual bloodstains. The prevalence of menstrual hygiene practices is lower in low-income states of central and eastern India. Multivariate analyses reveal that education of women and wealth status are found to be the most important positive factors of menstrual hygienic practices. Women's autonomy and exposure to mass media also have a positive impact on the use of menstrual hygiene practice. In contrast, women residing in rural areas, belonging in scheduled tribes and unemployed women are less likely to use hygienic methods during their menstruation. The findings of this study suggest increasing opportunities for female education, providing economic incentives, enhancing women's autonomy could help to increase hygienic practices of women during menstruation period. Furthermore, interventions should target socio-economically disadvantaged women to raise the use of sanitary napkins.",['Roy A; Paul P; Saha J; Barman B; Kapasia N; Chouhan P'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938257,"study based on secondary data collected from the latest round of the national family health survey. 94,034 young currently married women aged 15-24 years were utilised in this study."
Retrospective analysis of hospital electronic health records reveals unseen cases of acute hepatitis with unknown aetiology in adults in Oxfordshire.,"An outbreak of acute severe hepatitis of unknown aetiology (AS-Hep-UA) in children during 2022 was subsequently linked to infections with adenovirus-associated virus 2 and other 'helper viruses', including human adenovirus. It is possible that evidence of such an outbreak could be identified at a population level based on routine data captured by electronic health records (EHR). We used anonymised EHR to collate retrospective data for all emergency presentations to Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in the UK, between 2016-2022, for all ages from 18 months and older. We investigated clinical characteristics and temporal distribution of presentations of acute hepatitis and of adenovirus infections based on laboratory data and clinical coding. We relaxed the stringent case definition adopted during the AS-Hep-UA to identify all cases of acute hepatitis with unknown aetiology (termed AHUA). We compared events within the outbreak period (defined as 1st Oct 2021-31 Aug 2022) to the rest of our study period. Over the study period, there were 903,433 acute presentations overall, of which 391 (0.04%) were classified as AHUA. AHUA episodes had significantly higher critical care admission rates (p < 0.0001, OR = 41.7, 95% CI:26.3-65.0) and longer inpatient admissions (p < 0.0001) compared with the rest of the patient population. During the outbreak period, significantly more adults (≥ 16 years) were diagnosed with AHUA (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 2.20-4.12), and there were significantly more human adenovirus (HadV) infections in children (p < 0.001, OR = 1.78, 95% CI:1.27-2.47). There were also more HAdV tests performed during the outbreak (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.27, 95% CI:1.17-1.37). Among 3,707 individuals who were tested for HAdV, 179 (4.8%) were positive. However, there was no evidence of more acute hepatitis or increased severity of illness in HadV-positive compared to negative cases. Our results highlight an increase in AHUA in adults coinciding with the period of the outbreak in children, but not linked to documented HAdV infection. Tracking changes in routinely collected clinical data through EHR could be used to support outbreak surveillance.",['Tan CCS; Kelly G; Cregan J; Wilson JD; James T; Chand M; Hopkins S; Swets M; Baillie JK; Jeffery K; Walker AS; Eyre DW; Stoesser N; Matthews PC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39010057,adenovirus-associated virus 2 and other 'helper viruses' linked to outbreak in 2022. adenovirus-associated virus 2 and other 'helper viruses' linked to outbreak.

What are the psychometric properties of a menstrual hygiene management scale: a community-based cross-sectional study.,"The last decade has highlighted how menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is a public health issue because of its link to health, education, social justice and human rights. However, measurement of MHM has not been validated across different studies. The objective of this manuscript was to test the psychometric properties of a MHM scale. An embedded mixed-method design was utilized. The girls (age 12-19) were from three districts of Uttar Pradesh (Mirzapur, Jaunpur and Sonebhadra), India. A total of 2212 girls participated in the structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers collected the data on tablets using computer assisted personal interviewing. A total of 36 FGDs were conducted among 309 girls between. Trained moderators collected the data. Factor analysis and thematic analysis was conducted to analyze and triangulate the data. More than 90% of the girls were from a marginalized caste. Overall, 28% of the girls practiced all six MHM behaviors adequately. The factor analysis found five separate constructs corresponding to menstrual health and hygiene management (MHHM) with a variation of 84% and eigenvalue of 1.7. Preparation of clean absorbent, storage of clean absorbent, frequency of changing and disposal loaded separately, corresponding to menstrual health. Privacy to change and hygiene loaded together (eigenvalue 0.91 each), corresponding to hygiene management. An underlying theme from the FGD was menstruation as a taboo and lack of privacy for changing the absorbent. MHM is multi-dimensional construct comprising of behaviors which were time-bound by menstruation (menstrual health) and behaviors not time-bound by menstruation (hygiene management). Based on these results, the author recommends that MHHM is used as an acronym in the future and proposes a revised definition for MHHM.",['Ramaiya A; Sood S'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32306931,study was conducted by a community-based cross-sectional study. the study was based on a mixed-method design. the results were compared to the menstrual hygiene management scale.
Theorizing a model information pathway to mitigate the menstrual taboo.,"The impact of menstruation on the society is directly seen in the educational opportunities, quality of life and professional endeavors of females. However, lack of menstrual hygiene management has indirect implication on the balance and development of the society and nation. This study is set in the Indian context. The researcher identifies actors with a potential of mitigating menstrual taboo and then theorizes an optimal information pathway to mitigate menstrual taboo. Diffusion of innovation, framing and agenda setting theories contribute as frameworks in the creation of an optimal pathway to dissolve the menstrual taboo. The actors identified in this model are scholars, health activists, students, NGOs, media, government, corporations and villages or communities. The determinants for the direction and the order of the pathway to diffuse knowledge and confidence among these actors are the ultimate goal and sustainability of the model, strengths and weaknesses of actors, and actors' extent of influence. Considering the absence of an existing alternate, this model pathway provides a solid framework purely from a theoretical perspective. Theoretically, this model pathway is possible, practical and optimal.",['Yagnik A'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29253134,"the impact of menstruation on the society is directly seen in education opportunities, quality of life and professional endeavors of females. lack of menstrual hygiene management has indirect implication on the balance and development of the society and nation."
Diagnostic Approaches in Nuclear Medicine for Reproductive Health Assessment: Hysterosalpingography in Radiology versus hysterosalpingoscintigraphy.,"Infertility is a significant aspect of reproductive health and evaluating degree of tubal pathology is essential for determining appropriate management plans. To assess the role of hysterosalpingoscintigraphy (HSSG) as a tubal patency test in nuclear medicine and compare it with hysterosalpingography (HSG) in radiology in infertile women and study pain perception in both tests as well. A prospective study was conducted on 50 infertility patients undergoing infertility evaluation at a tertiary care hospital. Both HSG and HSSG procedures were performed during proliferative phase of menstrual cycle. Our study demonstrated the potential of HSSG as a tool for evaluating tubal patency in infertility workup. It showed good accuracy in detecting tubal patency compared to HSG. HSG is a radiological procedure valued for its ability to provide detailed anatomical information of uterus and patency of fallopian tubes. In contrast, HSSG provides dynamic information on the functional aspects of the reproductive system using nuclear medicine techniques. Both HSG and HSSG are vital tools in the diagnostic armamentarium for assessing female reproductive health, offering complementary information that aids in comprehensive patient management.",['Asima B; Jain A; Biswas JK; Mahato A; Vishnoi MG; Tiwari A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38989318,hysterosalpingoscintigraphy is a tubal patency test in nuclear medicine. hysterosalpingography is a radiological procedure valued for its ability to provide detailed anatomical information of uterus and patency of fallopian tubes.
Establishment of Murine Pregnancy Requires the Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Transcription Factor.,"Using an established human primary cell culture model, we previously demonstrated that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor is a direct target of the progesterone receptor (PGR) and is essential for progestin-dependent decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). These in vitro findings were supported by immunohistochemical analysis of human endometrial tissue biopsies, which showed that the strongest immunoreactivity for endometrial PLZF is detected during the progesterone (P4)-dominant secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. While these human studies provided critical clinical support for the important role of PLZF in P4-dependent HESC decidualization, functional validation in vivo was not possible due to the absence of suitable animal models. To address this deficiency, we recently generated a conditional knockout mouse model in which PLZF is ablated in PGR-positive cells of the mouse (<i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i>). The <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> female was phenotypically analyzed using immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Reproductive function was tested using the timed natural pregnancy model as well as the artificial decidual response assay. Even though ovarian activity is not affected, female <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> mice exhibit an infertility phenotype due to an inability of the embryo to implant into the <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> endometrium. Initial cellular and molecular phenotyping investigations reveal that the <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> endometrium is unable to develop a transient receptive state, which is reflected at the molecular level by a blunted response to P4 exposure with a concomitant unopposed response to 17-β estradiol. In addition to a defect in P4-dependent receptivity, the <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> endometrium fails to undergo decidualization in response to an artificial decidual stimulus, providing the in vivo validation for our earlier HESC culture findings. Collectively, our new <i>Plzf <sup>d/d</sup></i> mouse model underscores the physiological importance of the PLZF transcription factor not only in endometrial stromal cell decidualization but also uterine receptivity, two uterine cellular processes that are indispensable for the establishment of pregnancy.",['Hai L; Maurya VK; DeMayo FJ; Lydon JP'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38542422,established human primary cell culture model requires the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger. progesterone receptor (PGR) is a direct target of the progesterone receptor.

Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults: a review in different country.,"Dysmenorrhea is still an important public health problem which may have a negative impact on female health, social relationships, school or work activities and psychological status. The aim of this review is a better understanding of the epidemiology of dysmenorrhoea and its effect on public health. Published studies in English providing relevant information on dysmenorrhea were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Google; restricting the population to  adolescents and young adult women and the year of publishing from 2010 to August 2015, based on the keywords 'dysmenorrhea', 'adolescents' and 'epidemiology'. In addition, the reference lists of the selected articles were examined. We found 50 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority were cross-sectional studies on 41,140 adolescents and young women published from 2010 onward. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea varied from 34 % (Egypt) to 94% (Oman) and the number of participants, reporting very severe pain varied from 0.9 % (Korea) to 59.8% (Bangladesh). Adolescents who missed school due to dysmenorrhoea ranged from 7.7% to 57.8% and 21.5% missed social activities. About 50% of students (53.7%-47.4%) reported a family history of dysmenorrhea. Incidence of dysmenorrhea was 0.97 times lower as age in-creased (p <0.006). Despite the high prevalence of dysmenorrhea in adolescents, many girls did not receive professional help or treatment. Mothers were the most important persons the girls turned to for answers regarding menstruation, followed by peers (52.9%) and school nurse. From 21% to 96% practised self-medication either by pharmacological or non pharmacological interventions. The limitation of these studies was that they did not distinguish between primary dysmenorrhea and secondary dysmenorrhea. The main gynecological complaint of adolescents is dysmenorrhea. Morbidity due to dysmenorrhea represents a substantial public health burden. It is one of the leading causes of absenteeism from school and work and is responsible for significant diminished quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and associated negative effects, many adolescents do not seek medical care for this condition. Appropriate counselling and management should be instituted among female students to help them cope with the challenges of dysmenorrhea. Information, education and support should also be extended to parents, school peer leaders, and hostel administrators in order to address the reproductive health needs of the female students.",['De Sanctis V; Soliman AT; Elsedfy H; Soliman NA; Soliman R; El Kholy M'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112688,"dysmenorrhea is still an important public health problem. it may have a negative impact on female health, social relationships, school or work activities and psychological status."
A Multimodal Qualitative Approach to Understanding Menstrual Health Equity among Adolescents and Young Adults.,"Menstrual inequity-unequal access to menstrual health care or products-negatively affects well-being in relation to the menstrual cycle, a construct known as menstrual health. Few studies have explored menstrual inequities among adolescent and young adult populations in the United States. This multimodal qualitative research aimed to explore factors that influence the lived experience of menstruation among this population. This qualitative study consisted of individual interviews among menstruators ages 13-24, recruited from an urban academic medical center. Participants (N = 20) were a mean age of 19 years; 25% previously endorsed period poverty, and 90% were publicly insured. We conducted semi-structured interviews using participant video diaries in a video elicitation exercise. Data were coded by 2 investigators using thematic analysis driven by grounded theory. Emergent themes included the need to normalize menstruation, the need for comprehensive menstrual health education, and the need for menstrual products to be more accessible. Twelve youth prepared video diaries, and all reported positive experiences with the video process. This youth-centered, multimodal study is one of the first to qualitatively explore the lived experiences of menstruation among adolescents in the United States and identified key inequities in menstrual health from their own perspectives. Thematic findings were mapped onto a proposed framework for menstrual equity that can be applied to future research and efforts around policy change. More research is needed to assess the impacts of these policies.",['Davies S; Darien K; Bazyar F; Biddle J; Brown B; Christman C; Saurman M; Wood S; Thomas D; Dowshen N'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37543239,multimodal qualitative research aimed to explore factors that influence the lived experience of menstruation among adolescents in the united states. thematic findings were mapped onto a proposed framework for menstrual equity that can be applied to future research and efforts around policy change.
Discovery and verification of Q-markers for promoting blood circulation and removing stasis of raw and wine-steamed Vaccaria segetalis based on pharmacological evaluation combined with chemometrics.,"Dried and mature seeds of Vaccaria segetalis (Neck.) Garcke ex Asch. (VS) are known for their therapeutic effects, as they stimulate blood circulation, promote menstruation and diuresis and eliminate gonorrhoea. However, due to its hard shell, the dissolution of its active ingredients is often improved by steaming and frying in clinical applications. Among the processed products, wine-steamed Vaccaria segetalis (WVS) is one of the commonly used ones. Numerous historical records have shown that wine steaming can enhance the efficacy of drugs to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. However, the differences in the efficacy of VS and WVS in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis have not been thoroughly studied, and the possible reasons for these differences have not been reported. The objective of this study was to identify quality markers (Q-markers) that could differentiate the efficacy of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis of VS and WVS, which could serve as a basis for the rational application of VS and WVS in clinical settings. A pharmacodynamic comparison between the water extracts of VS and WVS was carried out based on a mouse acute blood stasis model (ABS) and thrombus zebrafish model. The potential bioactive substances of WVS were screened by investigating the correlation between common peaks identified for 10 batches of WVS by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and their rate of thrombosis inhibition in zebrafish. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis of chemical components between VS and WVS was conducted to speculate the Q-markers combined with the results of the bioactive components. Based on the efficacy verification of Q-markers, the content of Q-markers in 10 batches of WVS was evaluated. The results of efficacy comparison assays demonstrated that the efficacy of WVS was more prominent than VS at the same dose. Five components were screened as effective components of WVS for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis by correlation analysis. Furthermore, a total of 24 common ingredients were identified in VS and WVS extracts, and 9 of them showed increased dissolution rate after wine steaming, including 4 active ingredients, Hypaphorine, Vaccarin, Saponarin, and Isovitexin-2″-O-arabinoside, which were screened out by correlation analysis. The monomer test suggested that these 4 components could activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, Hypaphorine, Vaccarin, Saponarin, and Isovitexin-2″-O-arabinoside were selected as Q-markers to distinguish between VS and WVS. The content determination showed that the total contents of 4 Q-markers of WVS from 10 batches with different origins ranged from 0.478% to 0.716%. This study compared the efficacy of VS and WVS in promoting blood circulation and resolving stasis and revealed Q-markers that reflected the difference in efficacy between them for the first time, which laid the foundation for establishing quality standards for WVS.",['Bing Y; Sun Z; Wu S; Zheng Y; Xi Y; Li W; Zou X; Qu Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37666377,a pharmacodynamic comparison was carried out based on a mouse acute blood stasis model. a pharmacodynamic comparison was carried out based on a mouse acute blood stasis model.
Perceived usefulness of digital self-tracking among people with multiple sclerosis.,"Self-care technologies may support patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in their everyday disease management by enabling self-monitoring of various health indicators, such as symptom levels and physical activity levels. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of tracking self-selected MS- and health-related measures via a digital self-tracking tool for people with MS (PwMS) over a period of six weeks. An initial development phase was followed by a six-week testing phase with 58 test participants. The evaluation phase followed a sequential, exploratory mixed-methods design, consisting of 14 interviews with test participants during the testing phase, followed by a survey of all participants after the testing phase to confirm and elaborate on the interview findings. The interview data were analyzed through a five-step thematic analysis, and the survey data were analyzed descriptively. The results of the mixed-methods study can be summarized in the following findings: (1) Use of the self-tracking tool assisted users in clarifying patterns regarding their symptoms, physical activity, sleep quality and emotional well-being. (2) Tracking physical activity and, to some extent, sleep had a motivational effect on participants in relation to increasing activity and/or changing habits.

Development of a generalized pseudo-probabilistic approach for characterizing ecological conditions in estuaries using secondary data.,"Under the best circumstances, achieving or sustaining optimum ecological conditions in estuaries is challenging. Persistent information gaps in estuarine data make it difficult to differentiate natural variability from potential regime shifts. Long-term monitoring is critical for tracking ecological change over time. In the United States (US), many resource management programs are working at maximum capacity to address existing state and federal water quality mandates (e.g., pollutant load limits, climate impact mitigation, and fisheries management) and have little room to expand routine sampling efforts to conduct periodic ecological baseline assessments, especially at state and local scales. Alternative design, monitoring, and assessment approaches are needed to help offset the burden of addressing additional data needs to increase understanding about estuarine system resilience when existing monitoring data are sparse or spatially limited. Research presented here offers a pseudo-probabilistic approach that allows for the use of found or secondary data, such as data on hand and other acquired data, to generate statistically robust characterizations of ecological conditions in estuaries. Our approach uses a generalized pseudo-probabilistic framework to synthesize data from different contributors to inform probabilistic-like baseline assessments. The methodology relies on simple geospatial techniques and existing tools (R package functions) developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency to support ecological monitoring and assessment programs like the National Coastal Condition Assessment. Using secondary estuarine water quality data collected in the Northwest Florida (US) estuaries, demonstrations suggest that the pseudo-probabilistic approach produces estuarine condition assessment results with reasonable statistical confidence, improved spatial representativeness, and value-added information. While the pseudo-probabilistic framework is not a substitute for fully evolved monitoring, it offers a scalable alternative to bridge the gap between limitations in resource management capability and optimal monitoring strategies to track ecological baselines in estuaries over time.",['Harwell LC; McMillion CA; Lamper AM; Summers JK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39030312,a generalized pseudo-probabilistic approach is used to characterize ecological conditions in estuaries using secondary data. the approach uses a pseudo-probabilistic framework to synthesize data from different contributors to generate statistically robust characterizations of ecological conditions in estuaries.
Can Google Help Your Nearsightedness? A Google Trend Analysis of Public Interest in Myopic Progression.,"To explore public interest in myopia progression and management and to correlate these trends to available treatments. Keywords were chosen for interest in myopia overall and those signifying interest in myopia treatments. Treatment options were separated into four main categories: atropine, glasses, contact lenses, and orthokeratology. Search terms were queried across ten years of Google Trends data and the relative search volume was analyzed to quantify the change in search volume over time. A positive linear trend over time was present for all myopia interest keywords except ""nearsighted"" (p = 0.074) and ""near work myopia"" (p = 0.086). Interest in the four myopia treatment categories included in this study also displayed a significant positive trend over time. There is also a statistically significant positive correlation between all four treatment options and four of the seven categories of population interest, ""myopia control"", ""myopia"", ""myopia progression"", and ""screen time myopia"". This study demonstrates the utility of GT to correlate public interest in myopia treatments over time. All treatment terms had statistically significant linear search volume growth over a ten-year period. The positive correlation between interest in myopia as a health problem and available treatments supports existing evidence that GT can track rising public health concerns and corresponding treatment-seeking behaviors.",['Panneerselvam S; Diklich N; Tijerina J; Falcone MM; Cavuoto KM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38933893,"search terms were queried across ten years of Google Trends data. a positive linear trend over time was present for all myopia interest keywords except ""nearsighted"" and ""near work myopia"""
Trait-related changes in brain network topology in premenstrual dysphoric disorder.,"The female predominance in the prevalence of depression is partially accounted by reactivity to hormonal fluctuations. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a reproductive subtype of depression characterized by cyclic emotional and somatic symptoms that recur before menstruation. Despite the growing understanding that most psychiatric disorders arise from dysfunctions in distributed brain circuits, the brain's functional connectome and its network properties of segregation and integration were not investigated in PMDD. To this end, we examined the brain's functional network organization in PMDD using graph theoretical analysis. 24 drug naïve women with PMDD and 27 controls without premenstrual symptoms underwent 2 resting-state fMRI scans, during the mid-follicular and late-luteal menstrual cycle phases. Functional connectivity MRI, graph theory metrics, and levels of sex hormones were computed during each menstrual phase. Altered network topology was found in PMDD across symptomatic and remitted stages in major graph metrics (characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, transitivity, local and global efficiency, centrality), indicating decreased functional network segregation and increased functional network integration. In addition, PMDD patients exhibited hypoconnectivity of the anterior temporal lobe and hyperconnectivity of the basal ganglia and thalamus, across menstrual phases. Furthermore, the relationship between difficulties in emotion regulation and PMDD was mediated by specific patterns of functional connectivity, including connections of the striatum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. The shifts in the functional connectome and its topology in PMDD may suggest trait vulnerability markers of the disorder.",['Dan R; Reuveni I; Canetti L; Weinstock M; Segman R; Goelman G; Bonne O'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470339,premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a reproductive subtype of depression. symptoms recur before menstruation. brain network topology was found in 24 women with PMDD.
Duet for menstrual protection: a feasibility study in Zimbabwe.,"Managing menses is a challenge for women in developing countries. Duet is a cervical barrier being developed for contraception and STI prevention. We explored the hypothetical acceptability of using Duet as a menstrual cup, among Zimbabwean women. A survey and focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with 43 women aged 18-45 years to gain information about their menstrual practices and attitudes regarding the use of Duet for menstrual protection. All 43 women reported that if Duet were available, they would ""definitely"" try it, and that it was ""very important"" that Duet is low cost and easy to clean; 86% reported that using it would make a difference in their lives. FGD findings highlighted unhygienic practices due to the lack of affordable options for menstrual management and a genuine interest in Duet, including its potential use for multiple purposes (contraception, disease prevention and menstrual protection). Accessing affordable and hygienic menstrual protection was a problem for these Zimbabwean women. Duet appeared acceptable and it would be feasible to conduct a user-acceptability study of Duet as a menstrual cup in Zimbabwe.",['Averbach S; Sahin-Hodoglugil N; Musara P; Chipato T; van der Straten A'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19442783,"duet is a cervical barrier being developed for contraception and STI prevention. 43 women aged 18-45 years said they would ""definitely"" try it. if Duet were available, they would ""definitely"" try it."
Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Review of Susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes.,"The polycystic ovarian syndrome affects many women today. Previous research has demonstrated a direct link between it and serious ailments such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and infertility. Originally thought to be a reproductive disorder, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is now understood to be a metabolic and psychological disorder. Women of reproductive age suffering from PCOS undergo hormonal imbalances in which progesterone, insulin, and testosterone are produced in excess. PCOS exhibits a variety of characteristics as well as a heterogeneity of symptoms, including acne, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, irregular menstruation, infertility, obesity, and mood disorders like despair and anxiety. Chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and an elevated threat of coronary artery disease are some of its defining characteristics. PCOS develops due to interacting genetic and environmental factors. From a gynaecological curiosity, it grew into a multisystem endocrinopathy. It is fascinating to learn how hormonal issues result in gynaecological problems. Insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinism, and an increase in ovarian androgenic hyperresponsiveness to circulating insulin are all directly related to hyperandrogenism and anovulation. Independent of weight, insulin resistance is more common with PCOS and plays a crucial role in the syndrome's metabolic and reproductive complications. Anovulation, polycystic ovaries, and elevated luteinizing hormones, which increase circulating androgen, are all caused by a reduction in follicle-stimulating hormone. High androgen levels cause hyperinsulinemia, which leads cells to become insulin resistant and makes PCOS patients more likely to develop diabetes mellitus. Later research established that women with polycystic ovarian shape and persistent anovulation are the only ones susceptible to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is thus a distinct characteristic of the condition. The purpose of this review paper is to investigate how PCOS ultimately results in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",['Layacha SY; Biswas DA'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36751233,polycystic ovarian syndrome affects many women today. it is thought to be a reproductive disorder. it is now understood to be a metabolic and psychological disorder.
Women's sexual experiences as a side effect of contraception in low- and middle-income countries: evidence from a systematic scoping review.,"Contraception is essential to preventing unintended pregnancy. While contraceptive use has increased significantly over the past decade, discontinuation and gaps in use remain common. Although women cite side effects as the reason for discontinuing or stopping methods, little is known about the specific ways in which contraception affects women's sexual experiences. This systematic scoping review aimed to understand how contraceptive-induced side effects relating to women's sexual experiences have been measured, classified, and explored in the literature, specifically in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were peer-reviewed, English-language articles published between 2003 and 2018 that examined women's sexual experiences related to their use of modern contraception, including sexual satisfaction, arousal, sexual dysfunction, discomfort, vaginal dryness, sexual frequency, and relationship or partner dynamics. Study populations were restricted to women of reproductive age in LMICs. Twenty-two studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, comprising a range of methods and geographies. Emergent sexual experience themes included: menstrual issues impacting sexual experience; libido; lubrication; sexual pleasure; dyspareunia; and female sexual function. Results highlight the variability in measures used, lack of a women-centred perspective, and void in research outside of high-income countries to study the influence of contraception on women's sexual experiences. Very few studies focused on women's sexual experiences as the primary outcome or predictor. Providers should adopt woman-centred contraceptive counselling that considers women's relationships. Further research is needed to disentangle the nuanced effects of contraception on women's sex lives, contraceptive decision-making, and method continuation.",['Wood SN; Karp C; Zimmerman L'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32530748,contraception is essential to preventing unintended pregnancy. discontinuation and gaps in use remain common. women cite side effects as the reason for discontinuing or stopping methods.
Determinants of Contraceptive Options among Postpartum Women Attending Selected Health Care Facilities in Nigeria: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Differences in availability and choices of contraceptive methods among postpartum women have been found to influence their quality of life as the fertility rate is very high, and the contraceptive usage rate persistently remains low in Nigeria. This study assessed the determinants of contraceptive options among postpartum women in Nigeria. Two Local Governments were randomly selected from the four Local Governments. Within these two local governments, five health facilities were selected. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the 240 respondents, while a structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Findings from the study indicated that 81.7% of the respondents have planned to have their current baby, and about 65.4% of the women have resumed sexual activities since delivery. Of those who have resumed sexual activities, the majority, 91.1% did so 6 weeks after delivery. Some form of contraceptive usage was prominent among 59.2% of the respondents, as the most common contraceptive method used was withdrawal (24.8%). Contraceptive prevalence was slightly lower for urban respondents than rural respondents, although the relationship was not significant. Also, there was a statistically significant relationship between the current use of contraceptives and resumption of sexual activities since delivery (<i>p</i> = .001), resumption of menstruation (<i>p</i> = .001), and information received about postpartum family planning (<i>p</i> = 0.013). Findings from this study emphasize the urgent need for enhanced accessibility and availability of contraceptive methods, with a parallel emphasis on targeted interventions and effective communication strategies to promote contraceptive uptake and family planning. Addressing these determinants is vital in improving postpartum women's overall quality of life in the study area.",['Adeoye YR; Esan DT; Onasoga OA; Afolayan JA; Bello CB; Olawade DB'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38268949,"study assessed determinants of contraceptive options among postpartum women. fertility rate is very high, and contraceptive usage rate persists low in Nigeria."
Primary care for women with intellectual disabilities.,"Women with intellectual disabilities (ID) need thoughtful, well-coordinated care from primary care physicians. They are particularly susceptible to experiencing disparities in care because of varied participation in shared decision making. This review of the current literature comments on the quantity and quality of existing studies regarding several key women's health issues: menstrual disorders, cervical and breast cancer screening, contraception, and osteoporosis. A review of the current thinking regarding ethical and legal issues in medical decision making for these women is also provided. We found that there are several high-quality studies recommending early and frequent screening for osteoporosis, which is more common in women with ID. Smaller and fewer studies comment specifically on techniques for accomplishing the gynecological examination in women with ID, although the cervical cancer screening recommendation should be individualized for these patients. Consensus data on the management of menstrual problems and contraception in women with ID is provided. There are some data on breast cancer incidence but few articles on methods to improve screening rates in women with ID.",['Wilkinson JE; Cerreto MC'],2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18467533,"primary care physicians need thoughtful, well-coordinated care. women with intellectual disabilities (ID) need thoughtful, well-coordinated care."
Intact Chorionic Vesicle in Very Early Products of Conception Specimens: Clinicopathologic Features of 26 Cases That May Mimic Complete Hydatidiform Mole.,"Among the morphologic mimics of hydatidiform moles, the chorionic vesicle of early first-trimester pregnancy has received scant attention. The chorionic vesicle is the stage of the implanted blastocyst in which the cytotrophoblastic shell is circumferentially lined by primary and secondary villi and envelops the notochord stage embryo, yolk sac, and amniotic sac, ∼5 to 6 weeks since the last menstrual period. Miscarriage specimens at this early gestational age that contain an intact chorionic vesicle may be misinterpreted as a complete hydatidiform mole because of its large size, cistern-like cavity, and circumferentially radiating villi and trophoblast, particularly so when embryonic tissue is absent. We present the clinicopathologic features of 26 products of conception specimens containing a chorionic vesicle, some of which were submitted for consultation as a possible complete mole. The median gestational age was 6 weeks. The majority were free-floating in the specimen, unattached to endometrium. The median diameter was 6.3 mm and ranged up to 11.3 mm. The embryo was absent in 81% of cases, leaving an empty cavity resembling the cistern of a complete mole in all but 2 cases. Most cases exhibited circumferential villi and variable degrees of proliferating polarized villous trophoblast and extravillous trophoblast but trophoblast atypia was absent. Villous stromal karyorrhexis and blue-gray myxoid extracellular stromal matrix were observed in the majority of cases. A minority exhibited focal abnormal villous morphology concerning for early molar pregnancy, including irregular projections (27%), invaginations (12%), or bulbous shapes (4%) of the villous contours and trophoblast pseudoinclusions (15%). In contrast, orderly hierarchical branching of the secondary villi occurred in 31%. p57 immunoexpression was intact in all 25 cases tested. Short tandem repeat genotype testing confirmed a biparental diploid genotype in both of 2 cases tested. Although uncommonly observed in early first-trimester products of conception specimens, the normal chorionic vesicle merits awareness as a potential diagnostic pitfall. While some morphologic features resemble those of a well-developed complete mole, at this early gestational age such features are not expected in a very early complete mole. Attention to the reported gestational age, if available, and presence of embryonic tissues will mitigate against misclassification as complete mole. As with the workup of any potential gestational trophoblastic disease, partnering the clinical and morphologic evaluation with molecular evaluation (intact p57 immunoexpression and lack of any of the characteristic molar genotypes) offers the most precise classification.",['Kayraklioglu N; Gasper C; Cho SJ; Lage J; Rabban JT'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36729386,chorionic vesicle is stage of implanted blastocyst in which cytotrophoblastic shell is circumferentially lined by primary and secondary villi. chorionic vesicle is stage of implanted blastocyst in which the cytotrophoblastic shell is circumferentially lined by primary and secondary villi. median gestational age was 6 weeks; majority were free-floating in the specimen.
Lifestyle and Prevalence of Menstrual Disorders among Undergraduate Medical and Nursing Students: Can We Bring a Change?,"Menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon, but sometimes the abnormalities and pain associated with it can severely affect the daily routine of women and may create a stressful environment for them. The objective of this study was to conduct a comparative evaluation of the pattern of menstruation, lifestyle and the outlook toward menstruation among undergraduate female medical and nursing students. It was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among the undergraduate medical and nursing students of a tertiary care Institute. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Of the 400 students approached, 188 completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 21.23 ± 1.47 years. The mean age of menarche was 12.65 ± 1.24 years among the medical students and 13.69 ± 1.38 years among the nursing students (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Overall, the common menstrual abnormalities observed were dysmenorrhea (71.2%) and premenstrual syndrome (70.2%) followed by menstrual irregularity (14.8%). On correlating lifestyle with menstrual abnormalities, no significant association was found. However, the most common reason for college absenteeism in both groups was dysmenorrhea and fear of unexpected heavy bleeding. Despite having a medical background and knowledge about the physiology of menstruation, medical and nursing students do carry certain myths regarding menstruation which are being carried forward in society. Small roleplays in the OPD (Outpatient Department) area and public awareness lectures should be planned. They will not only develop confidence and better understanding among the students but also create social awareness.",['Singh P; Sharma C; Krishna S; Mishra V; Yadav G; Patwa P; Gothwal M; Jhirwal M'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35928060,"menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon, but sometimes the abnormalities and pain associated with it can severely affect the daily routine of women. the study was conducted among undergraduate medical and nursing students of a tertiary care institute."
GOES ABI-derived hailstorm polygons and tracking dataset for Brazil.,"This paper describes a dataset of convective systems (CSs) associated with hailstorms over Brazil tracked using GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) measurements and the Tracking and Analysis of Thunderstorms (TATHU) tool. The dataset spans from June 5, 2018, to September 30, 2023, providing five-year period of storm activity. CSs were detected and tracked using the ABI's clean IR window brightness temperature at 10.3 µm, projected on a 2 km x 2 km Lat-Lon WGS84 grid. Systems were identified using a brightness temperature (BT) threshold of 235 K, conducive to detecting convective clusters with larger area and excluding smaller or non-convective cells such as groups of thin Cirrus clouds. Each detected CS was treated as an object, containing geographic boundaries and raster statistics such as BT's mean, minimum, standard deviation, and count of data points within the CS polygon, which serves as proxy for size estimates. The life cycle of each system was tracked based on a 10 % overlap area criterion, ensuring continuity, unless disrupted by dissociative or associative events. Then, the tracked CSs were filtered for intersections in space and time with verified ground reports of hail, from the Prevots group. The matches were then exported to a database with SpatiaLite enabled data format to facilitate spatial data queries and analyses. This database is structured to support advanced research in severe weather events, in particular hailfall. This setting allows for extensive temporal and spatial analyses of convective systems, making it useful for meteorologists, climate scientists, and researchers in related fields . The inclusion of detailed tracking information and raster statistics offers potential for diverse applications, including climate model validation, weather prediction enhancements, and studies on the climatological impact of severe weather phenomena in Brazil.",['Sena CAP; Negri RG; Gava MLLM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100784,"GOES ABI-derived hailstorm polygons and tracking dataset for brazil.

Effect of estrogen/progesterone ratio on the differentiation and the barrier function of epidermal keratinocyte and three-dimensional cultured human epidermis.,"Estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) are the major female hormones and are secreted with changing concentration ratios throughout the menstrual cycle. These hormones have been studied individually regarding their physiological function in the skin, but their concentration ratio (E/P) and its effect on the skin has not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of the E/P ratio on skin barrier function. The menstrual cycle was divided into the menstrual, follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases. The E/P concentration ratios corresponding with each phase were added to a three-dimensional epidermal model or normal human epidermal keratinocytes for 5 days. Gene and protein expression levels of several markers of cell differentiation, including loricrin (LOR) and transglutaminase (TGase), were quantified by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of the three-dimensional epidermal model was measured, and ceramide content was quantified by thin-layer chromatography. Gene expression of the epidermal differentiation markers, LOR and TGase, increased when applying the concentration ratio of E/P associated with the menstrual and luteal phases. The LOR protein level decreased from menstrual to luteal phases, and the TGase protein level increased from menstrual to luteal phases. During the same phases, ceramide NS increased and TEWL decreased. Skin barrier function was improved by culturing cells at specific E/P concentration ratios, which would, therefore, be considered beneficial for female skin. This suggests that dysregulated E/P concentration ratios may be the cause of certain skin problems.",['Murakami K; Sawada A; Mori T; Sakuyama S; Tokudome Y'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35081394,"estrogen/progesterone ratio is the major female hormones. hormones secreted with changing concentration ratios throughout the menstrual cycle. the menstrual cycle was divided into the menstrual, follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases."
Menstrual cycle patterns and their relationship with measures of well-being and perceived performance metrics in competitive and recreational resistance-trained athletes.,"There is mixed evidence on how the menstrual cycle (MC) affects sports performance, with many studies showing variations in performance during different phases of the MC, while other evidence shows that the MC's effects on performance may be trivial. Therefore, this exploratory longitudinal monitoring study was designed to investigate MC characteristics and symptoms in a resistance-trained (RT) population to look for associations between measures of well-being and perceived performance metrics across the MC. RT females reported their workout habits, perceived performance metrics, and measures of well-being while tracking their MC with detailed methods via daily check-ins in an app. Most MC characteristics and symptoms in the present RT population aligned with previous research on the general population. However, the frequency of irregular cycles was higher than in previous research on the general population. The amount of individual variation and within-subject cycle-to-cycle variation in MC characteristics and MC symptoms was also high. All measures of well-being were significantly associated with specific days of the MC, demonstrating a change in well-being based on the timing of the MC. Several perceived performance metrics were significantly associated with changes across the MC, while others were not. Overall, with the current evidence as it stands, a highly individualized approach should be taken for any training or performance considerations surrounding the MC due to the high levels of individual variation.",['Santabarbara KL; Helms ER; Stewart TI; Armour MJ; Harris NK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38916093,a study was designed to investigate MC characteristics and symptoms in a resistance-trained population. a study found that MC characteristics and symptoms were associated with different stages of the MC. a high level of individual variation and within-subject cycle-to-cycle variation in MC characteristics and MC symptoms was also high.
Concerns and expectations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome vary across age and ethnicity: findings from PCOS Pearls Study.,"To understand and explore the perceptions and opinions of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and further delineate the variations across age and ethnicity. Qualitative survey focussed on lived experiences of people with PCOS. Participants could share their views either as written text or as voice note audio recording(s) on WhatsApp. The data from the audio were transcribed verbatim. Responses were coded by two study members independently, using a thematic inductive method with NVivo 12. Two senior study members then reviewed these codes to identify common themes. Women with PCOS aged 18-60 years. 43 of 45 participants had a formal diagnosis of PCOS, the remaining two had suspected PCOS which was under investigation. Four participants opted to share their views as voice note recordings. Poor mental health was the most reported (83.3% of participants), followed by dermatological (81.0%) and menstrual issues (76.2%). Participants were generally dissatisfied with the care they received (88.1%). A lengthy diagnostic journey was reported in 35.7% of cases. 52.6% felt less feminine, particularly regarding weight gain and infertility. As part of the recommendations by participants, it was emphasised that others with the condition should educate themselves and be proactive in their management. 46.3% reported that being more enlightened regarding their condition improved their health outcomes and enabled them to advocate for their own care. Women in their 20s expressed distress due to poor mental health, needing a longer time to get the diagnosis, and having weight and eating concerns. While women with PCOS in their 30s discussed their menstrual irregularities and fertility issues, those in their 40s expressed their concerns about the societal expectations of women when diagnosed with PCOS. The concerns varied across ethnicities as well. PCOS has wide-ranging consequences for women living with the condition, with many dissatisfied with the clinical support they currently receive. The concerns and expectations vary across ages and ethnicities. Therefore, we propose involving women with PCOS to co-create clinical and educational resources informed by lived experiences to provide end-user-informed services.","[""Elghobashy M; Lau GM; Davitadze M; Gillett CDT; O'Reilly MW; Arlt W; Lindenmeyer A; Kempegowda P""]",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37621648,women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) share their views as written text or voice note audio recording(s) on WhatsApp. participants could share their views either as written text or as voice note audio recording(s) on social media.
"The impact of COVID-19 on menstrual cycle's alterations, in relation to depression and sleep disturbances: a prospective observational study in a population of medical students.","The sars-Cov-2 pandemic has determined psychological stress, particularly in the young population of medical students. We studied the impact of the pandemic on menstrual cycle alteration in relation to psychological stress, presence of depression, sleep disturbances and post-traumatic stress, on a population of medical students. 293 female students at the Faculty of Medicine and Psychology of the Sapienza University of Rome (23.08 years old ± 3.8) were enrolled. In March 2021, one year after quarantine, a personal data sheet on menstrual cycle, examining the quality of the menstrual cycle during the pandemic, compared to the previous period. Concomitantly, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Impact of Event Scale have been administered. A Pearson chi-square test was assessed to evaluate the difference between the characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the scores obtained with the questionnaires. A statistically significant association between menstrual alterations and stress during pandemic had been found. The onset of depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances was observed in 57.1% and in 58.1% of young women with cycle's alterations, respectively. Amenorrhea was three times more common in female students with depressive symptoms, premenstrual syndrome had a significant correlation with both depression and sleep disturbances. The pandemic has been related to menstrual alterations, with depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Amenorrhea is connected to depression, as observed on the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The pandemic affected the menstrual cycle as well as the depressive symptoms and sleep. Practical implications of the study lead to the development of strategies for psychological intervention during the pandemic experience, in order to help medical trainees, with specific attention to women's needs. Future studies should analyze the impact of other types of social stress events, on sleep, depression and the menstrual cycle beside the pandemic.",['Polese D; Costanzi F; Bianchi P; Frega A; Bellati F; De Marco MP; Parisi P; Bruni O; Caserta D; Cozza G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38373995,the sars-Cov-2 pandemic has determined psychological stress. the pandemic has been related to menstrual alterations.
Enhancing Emergency Department Pain Management for Older Adults with the Hip Fracture Fast-Track (HFFT) Protocol in a Middle-Income Country.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Hip Fracture Fast-Track (HFFT) protocol, designed specifically for older patients at our hospital, which commenced on January 1, 2022, on the management of emergency department (ED) pain in older adults with hip fractures. Retrospective pre- and post-study data from electronic health records (EHR) at our hospital, using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes S72.0, S72.1, S72.8, and S72.9, were utilized. The study included patients aged 65 years or older who presented to the ED with low-energy, non-pathologic isolated hip fractures or proximal femur fractures. The pre-HFFT period included patients from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, and the post-HFFT period included patients from January 1, 2022, to October 31, 2023. Data were compared for the proportion of patients undergoing pain evaluation in the ED, before discharge, time to first analgesia, number of patients receiving pain relief in the ED, and the use of fascia iliaca compartment blocks (FICBs) and pericapsular nerve group blocks (PENGBs). The final analysis involved 258 patients, with 116 in the pre-protocol group and 142 in the post-protocol group. The rate of analgesic use increased significantly in the post-HFFT group (78 [67.24%] vs 111 [78.17%], P = 0.049). The rate of pain score screening at triage increased from 51.72% before the HFFT protocol to 86.62% post-HFFT protocol (p < 0.001). Compared with the pre-HFFT protocol, the post-HFFT protocol exhibited a higher rate of FICB (0% vs 14.08%, p < 0.001) and PENGB (0% vs 5.63%, p = 0.009) administration. The HFFT protocol's implementation was associated with improved ED pain evaluation and analgesic administration in older adults with hip fractures. These findings indicate that tailored protocols, such as the HFFT, hold promise for enhancing emergency care for this vulnerable population.",['Sri-On J; Worawiwat T; Luksameearunothai K; Nirunsuk P; Vanichkulbodee A; Fusakul Y; Phisaiphun K; Kanokkarnjana P; Lerdruttanasoontorn D; Thong-On K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38974510,the study aimed to evaluate the impact of the hip fracture Fast-Track protocol on the management of emergency department pain in older adults with hip fractures. the protocol was designed specifically for older patients at our hospital.
"Having a toilet is not enough: the limitations in fulfilling the human rights to water and sanitation in a municipal school in Bahia, Brazil.","This article addresses the enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation (HRTWS), in particular access to toilets, in a public school in Bahia, Brazil. Participant observation of the school's routine, focus groups with students in grades 8 and 9 of primary school (13 to 17 years old) and individual, semi-structured, interviews with members of school staff were applied, exploring access to water and sanitation by adolescent girls and boys. Students and school staff reported that the amount of toilets was insufficient and that their conditions were often inadequate because they were plugged or dirty. The impact on girls is greater as toilets do not offer a clean and healthy environment for menstrual hygiene management. Several elements of the normative content of the HRTWS, especially accessibility, acceptability, quality, safety and dignity, were largely not fulfilled. The study identified that, to comply with the HRTWS, it is necessary to go beyond infrastructure, as the lack of maintenance; cultural elements and student participation hinder the usage of sanitary facilities. Since schools can be privileged spaces to train critical and reflective citizens and to foster autonomy and emancipation, education oriented by human rights and citizenship is an opportunity for a more equitable society. By increasing access to social, economic and cultural rights in all phases and aspects of life, including when children and adolescents are in a school environment, people are able to enjoy better living conditions and a higher standard of health. The study raised the importance of considering each community's sociocultural aspects in analyzing access to sanitary facilities in schools, which are spaces where citizens' rights should be exercised and fulfilled.",['Coswosk ÉD; Neves-Silva P; Modena CM; Heller L'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30704435,"the human rights to water and sanitation (HRTWS) is a requirement in a municipal school in Bahia, brazil. the study aims to improve access to water and sanitation in schools."
Differential changes in appetite hormones post-prandially based on menstrual cycle phase and oral contraceptive use: A preliminary study.,"This was a preliminary study that examined whether appetite regulation is altered during the menstrual cycle or with oral contraceptives. Ten naturally cycling females (NON-USERS) and nine tri-phasic oral contraceptive using females (USERS) completed experimental sessions during each menstrual phase (follicular phase: FP; ovulatory phase: OP; luteal phase: LP). Appetite perceptions and blood samples were obtained fasted, 30, 60, and 90 min post-prandial to measure acylated ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and total peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY). Changes were considered important if p < 0.100 and the effect size was ≥medium. There appeared to be a three-way (group x phase x time) interaction for acylated ghrelin where concentrations appeared to be greater in USERS versus NON-USERS during the OP 90-min post-prandial and during the LP fasted, and 90-min post-prandial. In USERS, ghrelin appeared to be greater 90-min post-prandial in the OP versus the FP with no other apparent differences between phases. There were no apparent differences between phases in NON-USERS. There appeared to be a three-way interaction for PYY where concentrations appeared to be greater in USERS during the FP 60-min post-prandial and during the OP 30-min post-prandial. In USERS PYY appeared to be greater 60-min post-prandial during the OP versus the LP with no other apparent differences. There were no apparent differences between phases in NON-USERS. There appeared to be no effect of group or phase on GLP-1, or appetite perceptions. These data demonstrate small effects of menstrual cycle phase and oral contraceptive use on the acylated ghrelin and total PYY response to a standardized meal, with no effects on active GLP-1 or perceived appetite, though more work with a large sample size is necessary.",['McCarthy SF; Townsend LK; McKie GL; Bornath DPD; Islam H; Gurd BJ; Medeiros PJ; Hazell TJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38636667,acylated ghrelin appeared to be greater 90-min post-prandial in the OP versus the FP. ghrelin appeared to be greater 90-min post-prandial in the OP versus the FP.
"Absenteeism and Health Behavior Trends Associated With Acute Respiratory Illness Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Community Household Cohort, King County, Washington.","Longitudinal data on how acute respiratory illness (ARI) affects behavior, namely school or work participation, and nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) usage before and during the COVID-19 pandemic is limited. The authors assessed how ARIs and specific symptoms affected school, work, and health-related behaviors over time. From November 2019 to June 2021, participating households with children in King County, Washington, were remotely monitored for ARI symptoms weekly. Following ARIs, participants reported illness-related effects on school, work, and NPI use. Using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, the authors examined associations between symptoms and behaviors. Of 1,861 participants, 581 (31%) from 293 households reported 884 ARIs and completed one-week follow-up surveys. Compared with the prepandemic period, during the period of the pandemic pre-COVID-19 vaccine, ARI-related school (56% vs 10%, <i>p</i><0.001) absenteeism decreased and masking increased (3% vs 28%, <i>p</i><0.001). After vaccine authorization in December 2020, more ARIs resulted in masking (3% vs 48%, <i>p</i><0.001), avoiding contact with non-household members (26% vs 58%, <i>p</i><0.001), and staying home (37% vs 69%, <i>p</i><0.001) compared with the prepandemic period. Constitutional symptoms such as fever were associated with work disruptions (OR=1.91; 95% CI=1.06, 3.43), staying home (OR=1.55; 95% CI=1.06, 2.27), and decreased contact with non-household members (OR=1.58; 95% CI=1.05, 2.36). This remote household study permitted uninterrupted tracking of behavioral changes in families with children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying increased use of some NPIs when ill but no additional illness-associated work or school disruptions.",['Chung E; Wang Y; Chow EJ; Emanuels A; Heimonen J; Ogokeh CE; Rolfes MA; Hughes JP; Uyeki TM; Starita LM; Hoag S; Boeckh M; Englund JA; Chu HY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39045125,"ARIs and specific symptoms affected school, work, and health-related behaviors. participants reported illness-related effects on school, work, and NPI use."
Efficacy of Tokishakuyakusan add-on therapy with low-dose oral contraceptive pills on endometriosis patients with dysmenorrhea.,"Tokishakuyakusan (TSS) is representative of popular Kampo medicines for Japanese women to treat dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation and menopause. Current hormonal treatments and low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) used as a first-choice drug for primary symptoms, however, have a high incidence of adverse events without improving patients' satisfaction. We evaluated the efficacy of TSS as additional treatment on the quality of life (QOL) of patients taking OCs with reduced therapeutic satisfaction. Twelve patients treated with OCs for endometriosis were enrolled. TSS (7.5 g/day) in combination with OCs were given for three menstrual cycles. The main outcome was the degree of QOL assessed using the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30). Secondary outcomes were the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ), patient's satisfaction using a Likert scale and cold feeling-visual analogue scale (VAS). In EHP-30, significant changes by TSS with OCs in each menstrual cycle were not found, although the scores for pain and emotional well-being tended to decrease. In MDQ, water retention in the premenstrual phase was improved. With regard to cold feeling-VAS, 61.6 mm at pretreatment decreased to 31.3 mm at the endpoint. Average Likert scale values after TSS treatment declined from 4.3 to 2.6. Cold feeling and patient's satisfaction have improved. Although the influence of TSS add-on therapy on QOL was moderate, possible improvement of cold feeling and menstruation-related symptoms was suggested.",['Taniguchi F; Tokita Y; Ota I; Yamane E; Komatsu H; Azuma Y; Sato E; Endo Y; Sunada H; Harada T'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32840017,"tokishakuyakusan (TSS) is representative of popular Kampo medicines for women to treat dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation and menopause. current hormonal treatments and low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) used as a first-choice drug for primary symptoms have a high incidence of adverse events without improving patients' satisfaction."
Comparison of luteal phase and follicular phase in-vitro maturation in women with oocyte maturation abnormalities.,"Are there differences in immature oocyte retrieval following luteal phase in-vitro maturation (IVM) compared with follicular phase IVM in women with oocyte maturation abnormalities (OMAs). From January 2019 to May 2023, a retrospective cohort study at a private IVF centre included 36 women with 53 IVM cycles in Group 1 (follicular phase) and 24 women with 32 IVM cycles in Group 2 (luteal phase). Additionally, nine women had both follicular and luteal phase IVM cycles for intracycle variability analysis. There were no differences in oocyte maturation stages between the groups at collection. Group 1 and Group 2 exhibited comparable median metaphase II oocyte rates per patient at 48 h after collection [40.0%, interquartile range (IQR) 0.0-66.7% versus 22.5%, IQR 0.0-52.9%] (P = 0.53). The median fertilization rate in Group 1 (66.7%, IQR 50.0-66.7%) was found to be comparable with that in Group 2 (66.7%, IQR 50.0-66.7%). There were no significant differences in the yielded embryo grades and pregnancy rates between the groups. Comparing follicular and luteal phase IVM within the same menstrual cycle in nine patients, no differences were observed in metaphase II oocyte maturation rates (P > 0.05). This study found no significant differences in oocyte maturation, fertilization rate, embryo quality or pregnancy outcomes between luteal phase and follicular phase IVM in women with OMAs. These findings suggest that luteal phase IVM can be used similarly to follicular phase IVM, offering a potential avenue to enhance embryo yield for women with OMAs.","[""Hatirnaz Ş; Hatirnaz E; Urkmez SS; Celik S; Urkmez' YC; Cao M; Tan SL; Dahan MH""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38364519,luteal phase in-vitro maturation (IVM) was compared with follicular phase in-vitro maturation. no differences were observed in metaphase II oocyte maturation rates.
Myocardial Strain Measured by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Predicts Cardiovascular Morbidity and Death.,"Myocardial strain using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a sensitive marker for predicting adverse outcomes in many cardiac disease states, but the prognostic value in the general population has not been studied conclusively. The goal of this study was to assess the independent prognostic value of CMR feature tracking (FT)-derived LV global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), and radial strain (GRS) metrics in predicting adverse outcomes (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death). Participants from the UK Biobank population imaging study were included. Univariable and multivariable Cox models were used for each outcome and each strain marker (GLS, GCS, GRS) separately. The multivariable models were tested with adjustment for prognostically important clinical features and conventional global LV imaging markers relevant for each outcome. Overall, 45,700 participants were included in the study (average age 65 ± 8 years), with a median follow-up period of 3 years. All univariable and multivariable models demonstrated that lower absolute GLS, GCS, and GRS were associated with increased incidence of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. All strain markers were independent predictors (incrementally above some respective conventional LV imaging markers) for the morbidity outcomes, but only GLS predicted death independently: (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.30). In the general population, LV strain metrics derived using CMR-FT in radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions are strongly and independently predictive of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke, but only GLS is independently predictive of death in an adult population cohort.",['Chadalavada S; Fung K; Rauseo E; Lee AM; Khanji MY; Amir-Khalili A; Paiva J; Naderi H; Banik S; Chirvasa M; Jensen MT; Aung N; Petersen SE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39111972,myocardial strain using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a sensitive marker for predicting adverse outcomes in many cardiac disease states. the prognostic value in the general population has not been studied conclusively.
Relationship between triglyceride-glucose index and endometriosis: a cross-sectional analysis.,"The link between insulin resistance and endometriosis is not well established. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index serves as a straightforward and economical indicator of insulin resistance. This study examines the link between the TyG index and the prevalence of endometriosis in a U.S. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the NHANES conducted between 1999 and 2006. Reproductive health was assessed through questionnaires, and the TyG index was derived from fasting triglyceride and glucose measurements. Weighted logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between the TyG index and endometriosis. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves explored the linear relationship, while stratified and sensitivity analyses assessed potential interactions and the robustness of the findings. The study included 2,346 women, with 176 diagnosed with endometriosis and 2,170 without. Women with endometriosis exhibited an elevated TyG index compared to those without the condition. The weighted logistic regression analysis revealed that the TyG index is an independent risk factor for endometriosis (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.17-2.14, p = 0.004). RCS analysis indicated a significant positive linear association between the TyG index and endometriosis, with a turning point at 8.51. Subgroup analysis indicated a stronger association in certain populations. The post-propensity score matching analysis confirmed the robustness of these findings. In the U.S. population, a higher TyG index is positively and linearly associated with endometriosis prevalence. Effective management of blood glucose and lipid levels may reduce the prevalence of endometriosis.",['Cao Y; Yang Q; Mai Q; Wuliu J; Deng K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39118074,cross-sectional analysis examines link between the TyG index and endometriosis. triglyceride-glucose index serves as a straightforward and economical indicator of insulin resistance.

The Impact of mHealth Education on Changing Menstrual Hygiene Management Knowledge and Practices Among School-Going Adolescent Girls in Rural Bangladesh: A Quasi-experimental Study Protocol.,"Menstruation is a normal physiological process for women during their reproductive cycle, typically beginning during adolescence. During this stage, lack of knowledge, social taboos, and shyness act as barriers to proper menstrual hygiene management, rendering adolescent girls more vulnerable. This issue is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. In rural areas of Bangladesh, there is a deficiency in menstrual hygiene management due to inadequate information and knowledge among adolescent girls. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of mHealth education on the knowledge and practices of menstrual hygiene management among school-going adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. This is a quasi-experimental study conducted from early June to December 2023 at a secondary high school in Chandpur, Bangladesh. Participants' data will be collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire covering socioeconomics, knowledge of menstrual hygiene management, and practices. Pre-test data will be collected at baseline, followed by a 6-month mHealth education intervention. Afterward, post-test data will be collected using the same questionnaire. The data will be analyzed as frequency and percentage for descriptive statistics, and a paired t-test will be used to compare the pre-and post-test data. In the study, 172 participants were enrolled at baseline. Among them, 69.8% were aged 10-14 years. The outcome of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings will provide evidence-based information for the government, researchers, and policymakers on menstrual hygiene management using mobile health technology. mHealth education can be posited as a significant tool for increasing knowledge and practices related to menstrual hygiene management in rural regions of Bangladesh.",['Rahman MJ; Rahman MM; Sarker MHR; Ahmed A; Ali M; Islam MZ; Bubly JA; Hawlader DH; Shimpuku Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38344509,"mHealth education is a quasi-experimental study conducted from early June to December 2023. participants' data will be collected through face-to-face interviews. pre-test data will be collected at baseline, followed by a 6-month mHealth education intervention."
A multi-faceted exploration of unmet needs in the continuing improvement and development of fertility care amidst a pandemic.,"The continuous improvement and development of fertility care, internationally, requires ongoing monitoring of current delivery processes and outcomes in clinical practice. This descriptive and exploratory mixed-methods study was conducted in eight countries (Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom) to assess the unmet needs of fertility patients (male and female), and existing challenges, barriers and educational gaps of physicians and laboratory specialists involved in human fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was deployed sequentially in two phases: 1) in-depth 45-minute semi-structured interviews (n=76), transcribed, coded and thematically analysed using an inductive reasoning approach, 2) an online survey (n=303) informed by the findings of the qualitative interviews, face validated by experts in reproductive medicine, and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The integrated results of both phases indicated numerous areas of challenges, including: 1) investigating male-related infertility; 2) deciding appropriate treatment for men and selective use of assisted reproductive technology; and 3) maintaining access to high-quality fertility care during a pandemic. The paper presents a reflective piece on knowledge and skills that warrant ongoing monitoring and improvement amongst reproductive medicine healthcare professionals amidst future pandemics and unanticipated health system disruptions. Moreover, these findings suggest that there is an additional need to better understand the required changes in policies and organizational processes that would facilitate access to andrology services for male infertility and specialized care, as needed.",['Augustyniak M; Coticchio G; Esteves SC; Kupka MS; Hong C; Fincham A; Lazure P; Péloquin S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39059016,descriptive mixed-methods study was conducted in eight countries. it was deployed sequentially in two phases. the results indicated numerous areas of challenges.
Heavy Menstrual Bleeding as a Common Presenting Symptom of Rare Platelet Disorders: Illustrative Case Examples.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common symptom in patients who present to the obstetrician-gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist and might result from an underlying inherited bleeding disorder. Whereas relatively common bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease are often included in standard laboratory assessments, rarer platelet function disorders can be challenging to diagnose. Additionally, HMB can be a particularly difficult symptom to manage in adolescents with platelet function disorders, and it is associated with decreased quality of life. We review the diagnostic and management issues of patients with platelet function disorders through the presentation of 2 patient case reports, with a focus on a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, an inherited qualitative disorder that affects platelet function. Whereas the first patient presented to the emergency department before the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and required a hematologic referral and extensive laboratory assessments, the second patient had been diagnosed with Glanzmann thrombasthenia as a child but experienced severe management challenges at the onset of menarche. In both patients, collaboration between the obstetrician-gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist and the hematologist was critical for achieving acute management of the bleeding symptoms and for ensuring optimal long-term disease management. Together, these cases highlight the importance of properly identifying females with HMB who might have an undiagnosed bleeding disorder and of consulting with a hematologist to determine an appropriate management plan throughout all life stages.","[""Rajpurkar M; O'Brien SH; Haamid FW; Cooper DL; Gunawardena S; Chitlur M""]",2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26876967,heavy menstrual bleeding is a common symptom in patients present to the obstetrician-gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist. the inherited qualitative disorder affects platelet function. the second patient had been diagnosed with Glanzmann thrombasthenia as a child.
Relationship between Hormonal Changes and Self-Perceived Halitosis in Females: A Cross-Sectional Study.,Halitosis is a growing concern for patients seeking dental treatment. Women experience hormonal changes throughout different phases of their life. These changes may affect volatile organic compound (VOC) production and can be linked to halitosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormonal changes on self-perceived halitosis in a sample of females using a self-administered questionnaire. This study used a cross-sectional observational design. The questionnaire was distributed electronically through Google forms. A total of 1089 participants completed the questionnaire. Almost 50% of participants were below the age of 25; and 12% were of menopausal age (defined as 45 years and older). Most participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (63.5%) while only 20% reported having hormonal disturbances. Almost 62% of the sample reported that they notice halitosis on themselves with 27.6% indicating their perception of halitosis occurred at different times of the month. Around 12% of the sample thought that a relationship between halitosis and their menstrual cycle existed with 4.6% reporting halitosis during menstruation. The present study found that regularity of menstrual cycle and hormonal disturbances can affect females' self-perceived halitosis and the prevalence of oral health symptoms.,['Alzoman H; Alssum L; Helmi M; Alsaleh L'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36611503,halitosis is a growing concern for patients seeking dental treatment. hormonal changes may affect volatile organic compound (VOC) production.
Reproductive aging and menopause-like transition in the menstruating spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus).,"Does the naturally menstruating spiny mouse go through menopause? Our study is the first to show a natural and gradual menopausal transition in a rodent. Age-related depletion of the human ovarian reserve (OvR) leads to menopause, the permanent cessation of menstruation and reproduction. Current rodent models of menopause are inappropriate for inferences of the human condition, as reproductive senescence is abrupt or induced through ovariectomy. The spiny mouse is the only confirmed rodent with a naturally occurring menstrual cycle. Histological assessment of virgin spiny mice occurred in females aged 6 months (n = 14), 1 year (n = 7), 2 years (n = 13), 3 years (n = 9) and 4 years (n = 9). Endocrinology was assessed in a further 9 females per age group. Five animals per group were used for ovarian stereology with additional ovaries collected at prenatal Day 35 (n = 3), day of birth (n = 5), postnatal Days 35 (n = 5) and 100 (n = 5) and 15 months (n = 5). Morphological changes in the reproductive system were examined using hematoxylin and eosin stains. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry assessed endometrial proliferation and sex steroids estradiol and testosterone were assayed using commercial ELISA kits. The proportion of females actively cycling was 86% at 6 months, 71% at 1 year, 69% at 2 years, 56% at 3 years and 44% at 4 years. Uterine and ovarian weights declined steadily from 1 year in all groups and corresponded with loss of uterine proliferation (P < 0.01). Estradiol was significantly decreased at 1 and 2 years compared to 6-month-old females, before becoming erratic at 3 and 4 years, with no changes in testosterone across any age. Fully formed primordial follicles were observed in prenatal ovaries. Aging impacted on both OvR and growing follicle numbers (P < 0.001-0.0001). After the age of 3 years, the follicle decline rate increased more than 5-fold. N/A. This is a descriptive study in a novel research rodent whereby reagents validated for use in the spiny mouse were limited. The gradual, rather than sudden, menopausal transition suggests that the spiny mouse is a more appropriate perimenopausal model than the current rodent models in which to examine the neuroendocrine pathways that encompass all hormonal interactions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The logistic, ethical and economic advantages of such a model may reduce our reliance on primates in menopause research and enable more thorough and invasive investigation than is possible in humans.

Knowledge about unintended pregnancy shortly after childbirth: An issue of ineffective counseling or adherence?,"Being aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant shortly after childbirth before the resumption of the menstrual period is often overlooked but remains a significant contributor to unintended pregnancies and may lead to maternal and neonatal comorbidities. Exploring the extent of awareness and associated factors could help tailor more interventions toward reducing the rates of short-interval unplanned pregnancies. This study explores the extent to which Ghanaian women are aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant shortly after childbirth before the resumption of the menstrual period and its associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey. The women participants were sampled using a two-stage cluster sampling design. We analyzed the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey data of 8815 women who had given birth and received both antenatal care and postnatal checks after delivery in health facilities (private and public) and responded to questions on being aware of short interpregnancy intervals. A multivariable survey logistic regression was used for the analysis. Of the 8815 women, approximately 62% of women who received both antenatal care and postnatal examinations before discharge reported being aware of short interpregnancy intervals. Postnatal examination before discharge but not antenatal care was associated with a higher awareness of short interpregnancy intervals. Women who received a postnatal examination were more aware of short interpregnancy intervals than their counterparts (adjusted odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.61). Also, awareness of short interpregnancy intervals increased with age, education, knowledge of the fertile period, contraceptive use, and delivery via cesarean section. Over a decade following the initiation of Ghana's free maternal health policy, there remains a significant gap in the awareness of short interpregnancy intervals, even among women who received both antenatal pregnancy care and postnatal examinations before discharge. The unawareness of the short interpregnancy interval observed in approximately 38% of women raises concerns about the effectiveness of counseling or education provided during antenatal care and immediate post-partum care regarding birth spacing, contraceptive use, the timing of resumption of sexual activity, and the extent to which women adhere to such guidance.",['Essien SK; Chireh B; Essien JK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38778791,study explores extent to which Ghanaian women are aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant shortly after childbirth. 8815 women who had given birth and received both antenatal care and postnatal checks after delivery in health facilities.
"""More natural but less normal"": reconsidering medicalisation and agency through women's accounts of menstrual suppression.","This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.",['Gunson JS'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20708833,a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate on menstrual suppression. a qualitative discourse analysis of the first extended cycle oral contraception. a qualitative interview with women about menstrual suppression is used to explore the productive nature of agency.
A Review on Initiatives for Promoting Better Menstrual Hygiene Practices and Management in India.,"Management of hygiene during menstruation is severely affected by the continued existence of several societal, cultural, and religious restrictions on menstruation and menstruation practices. Since they are frequently unprepared and unaware of their periods, especially in rural regions of the country, girls face a variety of hurdles and problems at home, in school, and at work. We observed from examining the studies that managing menstrual hygiene is affected by a lack of personal sanitation and inadequate, erroneous, or partial understanding of menstruation. Women either possess zero or minimal knowledge about genital infections, which are caused by poor personal hygiene during menstruation. Women in rural areas frequently lack access to sanitary items and have inadequate understanding of their sorts and applications, or cannot afford the high cost of such products. Females in rural areas must use washable cotton pads because of this, which they must use repeatedly. The requirements and desires of teenage girls and women continue to be disregarded, despite substantial developments in the water and sanitation industries. Menstrual products are disposed of in domestic garbage and public facilities when women are outside, while they are flushed down toilets at home without considering the risk of choking. Because of this, there should be a need to inform and educate individuals about the health risks and environmental problems connected to them. Reduced trash may be achieved by using modern techniques like incineration. Therefore, the importance of using natural or reusable sanitary products should be emphasized.",['Kumari S; Muneshwar KN'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38021741,"menstrual hygiene is severely affected by the continued existence of several societal, cultural, and religious restrictions on menstruation and menstruation practices. women in rural areas often lack access to sanitary items and have inadequate understanding of their sorts and applications. women in rural areas often lack access to sanitary items and cannot afford the high cost of such products."
Does the Value of FSH Predict Severity of Metabolic Complications in Females with POI?,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as a cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40. Such early deprivation of estrogens in women may be associated with several adverse cardiovascular and metabolic consequences. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether women with POI and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 25−40 I/U (Group A) have the same metabolic profile as women with POI and a serum FSH level of >40 I/U (Group B). One hundred twenty-three women were included in the study group (Group A; n = 41; Group B; n = 82). The control group comprised 77 healthy women with regular menstruation. In the age- and BMI-adjusted model, no differences were found between the groups with respect to total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, glucose, and insulin.

Comparing Pilates and Gym Ball Exercises for Primary Dysmenorrhea Management: An Empirical Study.,"Primary dysmenorrhea, commonly known as menstrual cramps, is a prevalent gynecological issue that impacts many women in their childbearing age. It manifests as reoccurring, cramp-like lower abdominal pain, usually commencing right prior to or during the menstrual period. These painful sensations can be severe, extending to the lower back and upper thighs can greatly disrupt a woman's daily life and overall well-being. The optimal exercise approach is needed for individuals seeking relief from primary dysmenorrhea, allowing healthcare providers and women themselves to make informed decisions regarding their treatment options. Though many forms of exercise interventions exist in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, this study aims to compare two forms of intervention namely pilates and gym ball exercises on pain and menstrual distress among women with Primary Dysmenorrhea. This experimental comparative study was carried out with 30 young female participants over a 12-week period. Participant recruitment was done through a simple random sampling method. The criteria of inclusion encompassed young females aged 17-25 years, those in good health, and those experiencing primary dysmenorrhea. Exclusion criteria included secondary dysmenorrhea, medication use, polycystic ovarian syndrome, bleeding disorders, positive pregnancy tests, breastfeeding, and other medical conditions. Group A received Pilates exercises, while Group B underwent Gym ball exercises. The assessment of both groups' menstrual distress levels was conducted using the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) and pain scores using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). In the statistical analysis, Group A (Pilates Exercises) showed a significantly lower mean value (2.60) on the VAS compared to Group B (Swiss Ball Exercises) (5.46), with both groups experiencing a notable reduction in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, on the MOOS MDQ score, Group A (Pilates Exercises) achieved a lower mean value (79.33) compared to Group B (Swiss Ball Exercises) (103.26), with both groups demonstrating a significant decrease in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of exercise therapy, particularly Pilates exercises, as a holistic approach to addressing primary dysmenorrhea, improving physical well-being, and enhancing the overall quality of life.",['Kirthika S V; S S; G MK; S R; Rnv D; P SS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38807793,"primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological issue that affects many women in their childbearing age. it manifests as reoccurring, cramp-like lower abdominal pain, usually commencing right prior to or during the menstrual period. the optimal exercise approach is needed for individuals seeking relief from primary dysmenorrhea."
An Assessment of the Mechanophysical and Hormonal Impact on Human Endometrial Epithelium Mechanics and Receptivity.,"The endometrial epithelium and underlying stroma undergo profound changes to support and limit embryo adhesion and invasion, which occur in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle during the window of implantation. This coincides with a peak in progesterone and estradiol production. We hypothesized that the interplay between hormone-induced changes in the mechanical properties of the endometrial epithelium and stroma supports this process. To study it, we used hormone-responsive endometrial adenocarcinoma-derived Ishikawa cells growing on substrates of different stiffness. We showed that Ishikawa monolayers on soft substrates are more tightly clustered and uniform than on stiff substrates. Probing for mechanical alterations, we found accelerated stress-relaxation after apical nanoindentation in hormone-stimulated monolayers on stiff substrates. Traction force microscopy furthermore revealed an increased number of foci with high traction in the presence of estradiol and progesterone on soft substrates. The detection of single cells and small cell clusters positive for the intermediate filament protein vimentin and the progesterone receptor further underscored monolayer heterogeneity. Finally, adhesion assays with trophoblast-derived AC-1M-88 spheroids were used to examine the effects of substrate stiffness and steroid hormones on endometrial receptivity. We conclude that the extracellular matrix and hormones act together to determine mechanical properties and, ultimately, embryo implantation.",['Sternberg AK; Izmaylova L; Buck VU; Classen-Linke I; Leube RE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38612536,endometrial epithelium and stroma undergo profound changes to support and limit embryo adhesion and invasion. this coincides with a peak in progesterone and estradiol production.
Shaping Microbiota During the First 1000 Days of Life.,"Given that the host-microbe interaction is shaped by the immune system response, it is important to understand the key immune system-microbiota relationship during the period from conception to the first years of life. The present work summarizes the available evidence concerning human reproductive microbiota, and also, the microbial colonization during early life, focusing on the potential impact on infant development and health outcomes. Furthermore, we conclude that some dietary strategies including specific probiotics and other-biotics could become potentially valuable tools to modulate the maternal-neonatal microbiota during this early critical window of opportunity for targeted health outcomes throughout the entire lifespan.",['Samarra A; Flores E; Bernabeu M; Cabrera-Rubio R; Bäuerl C; Selma-Royo M; Collado MC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39060728,the present work focuses on the potential impact on infant development and health outcomes. some dietary strategies including specific probiotics and other-biotics could become potentially valuable tools to modulate the maternal-neonatal microbiota during this early critical window of opportunity for targeted health outcomes throughout the entire lifespan.
Menstrual cup use and intrauterine device expulsion in a copper intrauterine device randomized trial.,"To evaluate menstrual cup use and intrauterine device (IUD) expulsion. We performed a secondary analysis of a 3-year contraceptive efficacy trial comparing two copper 380 mm<sup>2</sup> IUDs. Investigators randomized participants approximately 1:4 to the TCu380A or NTCu380-Mini IUD. Approximately 12 months after enrollment began, we advised participants against menstrual cup use due to observed IUD expulsions in cup users. We evaluated IUD expulsion (including spontaneous partial and complete expulsion and accidental self-removal) at 12 and 36 months. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate IUD expulsion by age, baseline menstrual volume, body mass index, IUD type, menstrual cup use, parity, and uterine length. This analysis included 1046 participants (203 TCu380A and 843 NTCu380-Mini), with 879 (84.0%) nulliparas. Through 12 and 36 months, expulsion occurred in 74 (7.1%, 95% CI 5.5-8.6%) and 133 (12.7%, 95% CI 10.7-14.7%) participants, respectively. Overall, 250 (23.9%) reported menstrual cup use. More menstrual cup users than non-users experienced expulsion through 12 months (32/203 [15.8%] vs. 42/843 [5.0%]) and 36 months (58/250 [23.2%] vs. 75/796 [9.4%]). Through 36 months, NTCu380-Mini menstrual cup users had higher expulsion odds, while TCu380A cup users did not. Menstrual cup users more frequently experienced accidental self-removal than non-users in participants using the TCu380A (3/53 [5.7%] vs. 0/150 [0.0%]) and the NTCu380-Mini (20/197 [10.2%] vs. 7/646 [1.1%]). In multivariable regression, we found increased odds of expulsion through 36 months in participants using menstrual cups with the NTCu380-Mini (aOR 3.13, 95% CI 1.16-8.46) and <25 years (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07-2.34). We found higher odds of IUD expulsion with menstrual cup and concurrent NTCu380-Mini IUD use over 36 months of use, but not with concurrent TCu380A IUD use. Menstrual cup users experienced higher likelihood of accidental self-removal regardless of IUD type. Menstrual cup and NTCu380-Mini use may increase IUD expulsion risk and may increase accidental self-removal risk with TCu380A and NTCu380-Mini use. Clinicians should advise patients of these risks and consider warning patients using an IUD shaped like the NTCu380-Mini (Nova-T frames) of expulsion risk with menstrual cup use.",['Brown JE; Creinin MD; Wu H; Hubacher D; Schreiber CA; Kaneshiro B; Nanda K; Blithe DL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38431257,menstrual cup use and intrauterine device expulsion were evaluated. a copper intrauterine device randomized trial was performed.
Spatial distribution of pregnancy and early motherhood among late adolescent girls in Ethiopia using data from the Ethiopia Demographics and Health Survey 2019: Spatial and multilevel analyses.,"Various governmental and non-governmental organizations in Ethiopia are striving to decrease adolescent pregnancy by enacting laws against early marriage, developing a national youth and adolescent reproductive health strategy, legalizing abortion, and developing an HIV/AIDS policy for youth; however, the issue of teenage pregnancy& early motherhood remains a major concern. Data were obtained from the Ethiopian Demographics and Health Survey (EDHS) in 2019. A total sample of 2210 adolescents was included in our study. Spatial autocorrelation, hotspot analysis, and spatial interpolation were used to observe significant spatial variation and clustering and to predict the prevalence of pregnancy in an unsampled area among adolescent girls in Ethiopia; a multilevel binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the outcome variable. The adjusted odds ratio was calculated with a 95% confidence interval, and the variables with a p-value 0.05 in the multivariable multilevel logistic regression were determined to be statistically significant. Global spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that the spatial distribution of late-adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood varied across Ethiopia (the Global Moran's Index I value showed GMI = 0.014, P 0.001). The spatial distribution revealed a high cluster (hot spot) of late-adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood in most parts of Gambella, Afar, Benishangul-Gumuz, the eastern part of Oromia, and Somalia. In the multivariable multilevel analysis, being 17 years old (AOR = 3.43; 95% CI: 1.54-7.59), 18 years old (AOR = 14.92; 95% CI: 6.78-32.8), and 19 years old (AOR = 8.44; 95% CI: 4.06, 17.56), married (AOR = 25.38; 95% CI: 15.33, 42.02), having completed primary, secondary, and higher education (AOR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21-0.95), and being at Gambela (AOR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.04, 12.75) were significant predictors of late adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood. Overall, the prevalence of late-adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood was found to be high. At the individual level, marital status, educational attainment, and age of adolescents were significant predictors of pregnancy and early motherhood, and regions were found at a community level associated with pregnancy and early motherhood among late adolescents. Therefore, late-adolescent girls should be educated about menstruation, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and contraceptives before they reach early adolescence.",['Assimamaw NT; Alemu TG; Techane MA; Wubneh CA; Belay GM; Tamir TT; Muhye AB; Kassie DG; Wondim A; Terefe B; Tarekegn BT; Ali MS; Fentie B; Gonete AT; Tekeba B; Kassa SF; Desta BK; Ayele AD; Dessie MT; Atalell KA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39088572,a total sample of 2210 adolescents was included in the study. a multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the outcome variable.
CLINICAL PROFILES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN AFTER SUFFERING FROM COVID-19 OR VACCINATION.,"The aim: To investigate changes in the characteristics of menstrual function in women after suffering from Covid-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods: After the retrospective analysis of 378 medical records patients were divided into: Group 1 (177 women) with menstrual function disorders (MFD) after COVID-19, Group 2 (121 women) with MFD after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, Group C (80 women) without MFD after COVID-19 or vaccination (controls). The study focused on the clinical and hormonal menstrual cycle characteristics and factors influencing MFD. Results: Dyshormonal thyroid disorders were observed in 63.0% of Group 1 and 45.7% of Group 2 patients; hyperprolactinemia - in 31.0% and 39.4%, hyper¬estrogenia - in 50% and 21%, and hyperandrogenism - in 39% and 20%. MFD was associated with hyperandrogenism with concurrent hyperprolactinemia, in the context of thyroid dysfunction; and with changes of gonadotropin production, along with normal and elevated estrogen concentrations and worsening of mental health that suggest disruption of central regulatory and feedback mechanisms in the pituitary-thyroid-ovarian system under the stressors influence. Conclusions: There are changes in the menstrual cycle associated with disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary system and thyroid function in women after suffering from Covid-19 or vaccination. To reestablish reproductive homeostasis, employing a personalized diagnostic strategy is recommended, encompassing the evaluation of thyroid gland status, hormonal profiling, and the consideration of psychosocial facets.",['Petruk AO; Lytvak OO'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37948722,a retrospective analysis of 378 medical records was conducted. the aim was to investigate changes in the characteristics of menstrual function in women after suffering from covid-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
Evidence of weight loss in junior female judo athletes affects their development.,"The facile manipulation of body weight in junior athletes has the potential to pose significant risks to their lifelong health. In judo, which is a weight class sport, pre-competition weight loss is widespread even among juniors, but information on the current situation is scarce, especially for female athletes, for whom it is important to provide adequate nutrition and enhance bone mass during the growth period, and the details of the current situation are not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the actual weight loss during the growth period in junior female judo athletes and its subsequent impact on their health. The survey was a cross-sectional survey of junior female judo athletes in Japan using a questionnaire. Participants were asked to respond via an online questionnaire about their weight, height, weight loss experience, menstruation, competition results, and other lifestyle. 51.8% of subjects experienced weight loss for competition during their junior high school years (ages 12-15). Those who experienced weight loss during secondary sexual characteristics were found to be significantly shorter in current height than those who did not (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Weight loss during secondary sexual characteristics did not affect current menstrual cycle. There was no significant difference in competition results due to the experience of weight loss during junior high school (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.485, df = 3, n.s.). These findings suggest that weight loss during the growth spurt phase may adversely impact normal development. It also suggested that weight loss during the junior high school years may not be a strategy to bring about better competition results. These observations indicate the need for education on appropriate class selection and weight control for junior athletes in weight class competitions.",['Yoshida E; Hayashida H; Sakurai T; Kawasaki K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38939754,"weight loss in junior female judo athletes can pose significant risks to their health. weight loss during the growth period in junior athletes is widespread even among juniors. but information on the current situation is scarce, especially for female athletes."
"Health issues in women and girls affected by haemophilia with a focus on nomenclature, heavy menstrual bleeding, and musculoskeletal issues.","Women and girls affected by haemophilia, including haemophilia carriers (WGH) are at risk of bleeding symptoms that may go unrecognized, including heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and musculoskeletal bleeding. Terminology continues to evolve. To describe the current recommendations for nomenclature surrounding WGH, and the current understanding of HMB, iron deficiency, and musculoskeletal complaints in these patients. Literature was reviewed and summarized. With regards to nomenclature, women with factor levels less than 50% should be classified as having haemophilia, while carriers with normal levels should be characterized accordingly to symptomatology. HMB and resultant iron deficiency are common among WGH, have a multitude of downstream effects, and maybe overlooked due to stigma around menstruation. Musculoskeletal bleeding and resultant joint changes are increasingly recognized in this population but do not necessarily correlate with factor levels. Although progress has been made in the care of WGH, much work remains to further improve their care.",['Weyand AC; Sidonio RF; Sholzberg M'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35521724,women and girls affected by haemophilia are at risk of bleeding symptoms that may go unrecognized. musculoskeletal bleeding and resultant joint changes are more recognized in this population.
"Quality of life of adolescents with menstrual problems in Klang Valley, Malaysia: a school population-based cross-sectional study.","To describe the prevalence of menstrual problems (heavy menses bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and oligomenorrhoea) and its impact towards quality of life among adolescents in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Cross-sectional study. Adolescent girls at secondary schools in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. 729 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years. A questionnaire survey using Menorrhagia Questionnaire and Paediatric Quality of Life-Teen Report Ages 13-18 (PedsQL). Self reports of menstrual bleeding patterns, morbidities and effect on quality of life. The prevalence of menstrual problems among adolescents was 63.9% in the Klang Valley. Adolescents with menstrual problems had significant lower mean total score of PedsQL (70.23±13.53 vs 76.36±14.93, p=0.001), physical health summary score (74.10±16.83 vs 79.00±15.86, p<0.001) and psychosocial health summary score (68.05±14.27 vs 73.21±13.09, p=0.001) compared with those without menstrual problem. Adolescents experiencing heavy menses bleeding had the lowest physical and emotional function. Those with oligomenorrhoea had the lowest social function, whereas those with dysmenorrhoea had the lowest school function. Cigarette smoking, alcohol and medical illness had lower health-related quality of life, whereas taking oral contraceptive pills for menstrual problems was associated with higher scores in these adolescents.

Examining temporal changes in model-optimized parameters using longitudinal hemodynamic measurements.,"We previously applied hemodynamic data to personalize a mathematical model of the circulation expressed as physically interpretable parameters. The aim of this study was to identify patterns in the data that could potentially explain the estimated parameter changes. This included investigating whether the parameters could be used to track the effect of physical activity on high blood pressure. Clinical trials have repeatedly detected beneficial changes in blood pressure after physical activity and uncovered changes in lower level phenotypes (such as stiffened or high-resistance blood vessels). These phenotypes can be characterized by parameters describing the mechanical properties of the circulatory system. These parameters can be incorporated in and contextualized by physics-based cardiovascular models of the circulation, which in combination can become tools for monitoring cardiovascular disease progression and management in the future. Closed-loop and open-loop models of the left ventricle and systemic circulation were previously optimized to data from a pilot study with a 12-week exercise intervention period. Basal characteristics and hemodynamic data such as blood pressure in the carotid, brachial and finger arteries, as well as left-ventricular outflow tract flow traces were collected in the trial. Model parameters estimated for measurements made on separate days during the trial were used to compute parameter changes for total peripheral resistance, systemic arterial compliance, and maximal left-ventricular elastance. We compared the changes in these cardiovascular model-based estimates to changes from more conventional estimates made without the use of physics-based models by correlation analysis. Additionally, ordinary linear regression and linear mixed-effects models were applied to determine the most informative measurements for the selected parameters. We applied maximal aerobic capacity (measured as <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mtext>VO2max</mtext></math> ) data to examine if exercise had any impact on parameters through regression analysis and case studies. Parameter changes in arterial parameters estimated using the cardiovascular models correlated moderately well with conventional estimates. Estimates based on carotid pressure waveforms gave higher correlations (0.59 and above when p <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo><</mo> <mn>0.05</mn></mrow> </math> ) than those for finger arterial pressure. Parameter changes over the 12-week study duration were of similar magnitude when compared to short-term changes after a bout of intensive exercise in the same parameters. The short-term changes were computed from measurements made immediately before and 24 h after a cardiopulmonary exercise test used to measure <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mtext>VO2max</mtext></math> . Regression analysis indicated that changes in <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mtext>VO2max</mtext></math> did not account for any substantial amount of variability in total peripheral resistance, systemic arterial compliance, or maximal left-ventricular elastance. On the contrary, changes in stroke volume contributed to far more explained variability. The results suggest that more research is required to be able to accurately track exercise-induced changes in the vasculature for people with pre-hypertension and hypertension using lumped-parameter models.",['Bjørdalsbakke NL; Sturdy J; Wisløff U; Hellevik LR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38982471,a longitudinal hemodynamic study used hemodynamic data to personalize a mathematical model of the circulation expressed as physically interpretable parameters. the aim of this study was to identify patterns in the data that could potentially explain the estimated parameter changes.
Menstrual bleeding: perspective of Brazilian women.,"Menstrual patterns, induced amenorrhea and the use of some contraceptive methods which induce non-bleeding are issues under debate among health professionals and women. The objective of the study was to describe perspectives and attitudes of Brazilian women regarding menstruation and its interference in daily activities. A semistructured questionnaire was applied to nonpregnant, nonlactating women between 18 and 45 years old, who were menstruating, consulting at public health services for other complaints than gynecological or reproductive health care, and staff members and teachers of public universities in one city of each geographic region of Brazil and the Federal District. Of the 885 women interviewed, 51.5% were aged 20-29 years, almost 60% reported normal frequency of bleeding, 22% and 43% reported interference of menstruation in their school activities and in the relationship with their partner, respectively. The value attributed to each interference (<5; ≥ 5; in a scale up to 10) was >5 for more than 60% of the women in all evaluated domains. The most common reason for disliking menstruation was inconvenient and/or discomfort, and for liking menstruation were feeling healthy and confirmation of not being pregnant. The variables associated to liking menstruation were attending <8 years of school and low economic class, having more than one child and no history of premenstrual tension. A great proportion of the interviewed women disliked having menstruation even when they did not present menstrual-related problems. However, some women still preferred monthly menstruation because they felt healthy and it was a free pregnancy test.",['Makuch MY; Osis MJ; Petta CA; de Pádua KS; Bahamondes L'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22078192,"menstrual patterns, induced amenorrhea and the use of contraceptive methods. the study was applied to nonpregnant women between 18 and 45 years old. the study was to describe perspectives and attitudes of women."
Factors associated with the place of death of persons with advanced dementia: A systematic review of international literature with meta-analysis.,"Many individuals with advanced dementia die in hospital, despite preferring home death. Existing evidence of factors affecting their place of death is inconsistent. To inform policies/practices for meeting needs/preferences, systematically establishing the evidence is pertinent, particularly given the exponential rise in advanced dementia prevalence. To identify factors influencing where people with advanced dementia die. This systematic review with meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022366722). Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SocINDEX and a grey literature database, Overton, were searched on 21/12/2022, supplemented by hand-searching/citation tracking. Papers reporting quantitative data on factors associated with place of death in advanced dementia were included and appraised using QualSyst. Data were analysed using random effects with the certainty of evidence determined using the GRADE criteria. Thirty-three papers involving >5 million individuals (mean age = 89.2 years) were included. Long-term care setting deaths were relatively common but hospice deaths were rarer. Marriage's association with home death underscores social networks' importance, while younger age's and male gender's associations with hospital death demonstrate patients' and families' interdependency. Pneumonia/COPD's opposing effects on hospital deaths with cancer/functional impairment highlight the challenges of advanced dementia care. Unlike hospital/nursing home bed availability's lack of effect, capitated funding (fixed-amount-per-patient-per-period) decreased hospital death likelihood. This comprehensive review of place of death determinants highlight the profound challenges of advanced dementia end-of-life care. Given that bed capacity did not affect place of death, a capitation-based, integrated palliative care model would appear more likely to meet patients' needs in a resource-constrained environment.",['Tay R; Tan JY; Lim B; Hum AY; Simpson J; Preston N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39092850,a systematic review of literature with meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO. researchers found evidence of factors affecting place of death in advanced dementia.
"Assessment of prevalence, knowledge and health-related practices of dysmenorrhea among Malaysian women in Kuala Lumpur: a cross-sectional survey.","Menstruation is a natural phenomenon considered an important indicator of women's health, reflecting their endocrine function. Women in low middle income countries face substantial menstrual hygiene management challenges. Data on the knowledge of dysmenorrhea and health-related practices among Malaysian women are scarce. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea among Malaysian women in Kuala Lumpur and its association with socio-demographic factors, knowledge level, and general practices. A cross-sectional study was carried out among Malaysian women in Kuala Lumpur. A total of 362 unmarried women, nulliparous and aged between 18 and 25 years old, were included in this study. Participants were conveniently recruited through online platforms as well as face to face using a self-administered questionnaire with five sections consisting of demographics, menstrual characteristics, Working ability, Location, Intensity, Days of pain, Dysmenorrhea (WaLIDD) score for diagnosing and assessing the severity of dysmenorrhea as well as an evaluation of respondents' general knowledge and practices towards dysmenorrhea. The collected data were analysed using the SPSS tool, a descriptive statistic was used to report demographic characteristics. Inferential statistics was used to report the differentiation, association, and correlations of the variables. The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea was 73.2%. It was found that the majority of the respondents had poor knowledge (60%) and poor practices (61.88%) of dysmenorrhea. The most common preventive practices among the respondents were using dietary supplements, and herbs, taking a rest and exercising.

"Conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes causes reduced litter size, ovarian reserve depletion and impaired oocyte in vitro maturation with advanced reproductive age in mice.","An estimated 1 in 350 women carry germline BRCA1/2 mutations, which confer an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and may also contribute to subfertility. All mature, sex steroid-producing ovarian follicles are drawn from the pool of non-renewable primordial follicles, termed the 'ovarian reserve'. The clinical implications of early ovarian reserve exhaustion extend beyond infertility, to include the long-term adverse health consequences of loss of endocrine function and premature menopause. We aimed to determine whether conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes impacts ovarian follicle numbers, oocyte quality and fertility in mice with advancing maternal age. We also aimed to determine the utility of AMH as a marker of ovarian function, by assessing circulating AMH levels in mice and women with BRCA1/2 mutations, and correlating this with ovarian follicle counts. In this study, we addressed a longstanding question in the field regarding the functional consequences of BRCA1 inactivation in oocytes. To recapitulate loss of BRCA1 protein function in oocytes, we generated mice with conditional gene deletion of Brca1 in oocytes using Gdf9-Cre recombinase (WT: Brca1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Gdf9<sup>+/+</sup>; cKO: Brca1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Gdf9<sup>cre/+</sup>). While the length of the fertile lifespan was not altered between groups after a comprehensive breeding trial, conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes led to reduced litter size in female mice. Brca1 cKO animals had a reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte maturation was impaired with advanced maternal age at postnatal day (PN)300, compared to WT animals. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations (the gold-standard indirect marker of the ovarian reserve used in clinical practice) were not predictive of reduced primordial follicle number in Brca1 cKO mice versus WT. Furthermore, we found no correlation between follicle number or density and serum AMH concentrations in matched samples from a small cohort of premenopausal women with BRCA1/2 mutations. Together, our data demonstrate that BRCA1 is a key regulator of oocyte number and quality in females and suggest that caution should be used in relying on AMH as a reliable marker of the ovarian reserve in this context.

The use of retrospective visual field databases is a novel undertaking, with no studies published utilising large scale population-level data. This study phase developed a method to extract HFA data into a large standardised population-based database including point sensitivity data with additional derived variables. Retrospective, longitudinal, population study of visual field data from people who attended an ophthalmology service and had a HFA field test, in Western Australia, between 1988 and 2022. Raw test data included patient demographic fields, sensitivity readings and test parameters. Calculated fields included reliability scores, and a novel combined reliability score. There were 606 230 tests for 92 215 study individuals, from 22 ophthalmology practices in metropolitan Perth and three public hospital eye clinics, representing around 85% of the field tests performed by ophthalmologists each year. Raw sensitivity values were available for all tests, and additional descriptors were available for most tests (97.5%-100% of tests) with the exception of data variables retired by the manufacturer. Visual field data from 606 230 tests were collated into a single dataset, which is highly representative over a long period of time, for a defined population. This dataset has been linked to other administrative datasets to allow for epidemiological investigation of field of vision disorders.",['Manners S; Morgan W; Morlet N; Meuleners L; Liu W; Morlet H; Ng JQ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39073299,retrospective visual field tests are a novel undertaking. no studies published using large scale population-level data. sensitivity data from 606 230 tests were collated into a single dataset.
Epilepsy and Issues Related to Reproductive Health.,"Sexual disorders are prevalent and vary in men and women with epilepsy (WWE). Infertility and reproductive abnormalities are twice as common in females with epilepsy. Antiepileptic medications and seizures can both have an impact on sexual health in people with epilepsy. Seizures can alter the release of pituitary and hypothalamic hormones, and some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can alter sex steroid hormones (gonadal steroids and gonad corticoids). Females with epilepsy are more susceptible to <i>menstrual cycle irregularity</i> and <i>polycystic ovary syndrome</i>. Females and males had lower reproductive rates, and the causes are likely psychological and physiological, with epilepsy and AEDs again playing a role. Sexual disorders are common in WWE and men with epilepsy and can be caused by psychological, physical, or social factors. Specialists must address the gender-based biology of epilepsy and the impact of AEDs on sexual well-being to offer the best treatment possible for patients with epilepsy, particularly women of sexual maturity.",['Khan M; Bankar NJ; Bandre GR; Dhobale AV; Bawaskar PA'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38050507,epilepsy and issues related to reproductive health vary in men and women with epilepsy. infertility and reproductive abnormalities are twice as common in females with epilepsy. some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can alter sex steroid hormones.
Update on polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in reproductive-age women. In 2018, an international evidence-based guideline announced recommendations spanning a wide range of issues on the assessment and management of PCOS. From the 166 recommendations, the present study reviews those that are of particular clinical relevance for daily practice and introduces other relevant studies that have been published since the global guideline. The 2018 guideline increased the antral follicle count cutoff for the diagnosis of PCOS from 12 to 20 when using a high-frequency probe. Hirsutism was defined as having a score of ≥4-6 based on a lower percentile of 85%-90% or cluster analysis, which was lower than the traditionally used 95th percentile-based cutoff. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is challenging, and irregular menstruation was defined carefully according to years from menarche. The use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of PCOS was restricted to those 8 years after menarche. As medication for non-fertility indications, combined oral contraceptives are the first-line drug. Metformin, in addition to lifestyle modifications, should be considered for adult patients with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 for the management of weight and metabolic outcomes. An aromatase inhibitor is the recommended first-line medication for ovulation induction, a subsequent individual patient data meta-analysis also reported the same conclusion. Whether the new global guideline will be fully adopted by many specialists and change clinical practice is open to question. Further studies are needed to better understand and manage PCOS patients well.",['Kim JJ'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34488284,"the 2018 guideline increased the antral follicle count cutoff for the diagnosis of PCOS from 12 to 20. the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is challenging, and irregular menstruation was defined carefully according to years from menarche."
"Mark-recapture validates the use of photo-identification for the widely distributed blue-spotted ribbontail ray, Taeniura lymma.","The ability to identify individual animals can provide valuable insights into the behaviour, life history, survivorship, and demographics of wild populations. Photo-identification (photo-ID) uses unique natural markings to identify individuals and can be effective for scalable and non-invasive research on marine fauna. The successful application of photo-ID requires that chosen distinguishing markings are unique to individuals and persist over time. In this study, we validate the use of dorsal spot patterns for identifying individual blue-spotted ribbontail rays (Taeniura lymma) in conjunction with traditional tagging methods. Spot patterns were unique among T. lymma with 90.3% of individuals correctly identified using I<sup>3</sup>S photo-matching software from images taken up to 496 days apart. In comparison, traditional physical tagging methods showed a tag loss rate of 27% and a maximum tag retention period of only 356 days. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of photo-ID as a tool to monitor populations and better understand the ecology of the blue-spotted ribbontail ray without the need for physical tagging. The validation of photo-ID for this widespread species is important as it enables behavioural and demographic changes to be easily tracked in relation to coastal threats such as human development and habitat degradation.",['McIvor AJ; Williams CT; Rich WA; Knochel AM; Burns NM; Berumen ML'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075077,photo-identification uses unique natural markings to identify individuals. the successful application of photo-ID requires that chosen distinguishing markings are unique to individuals and persist over time.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia disorder due to 17 α-hydroxylase deficiency: a case report.,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a related enzyme deficiency involved in the adrenal corticosteroid synthesis pathway due to genetic mutations. 17α-hydroxylase deficiency(17α-OHD) is a rare form of CAH. Herein, we reported clinical data on diagnosis and treatment regimens for a 17α-hydroxylase-deficient patient. A 24-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with limb numbness for 7 days and sudden limb weakness. Full laboratory and radio-imaging investigations showed hypokalemia and abdominal occupation. Abnormal rhythm of cortisol(Cor) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)was observed. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation detection, which showed a homozygous mutation of <i>c.987del</i> in the 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (17OHD) lease-related <i>CYP17A1</i> from both biological parents. The patient was treated with prednisone acetate and estradiol valerate. After one year of treatment with predisoone acetate and estradiol valerate, the patient had normal menstruation, increased blood potassium, estradiol and 24h-UFC, and decreased ACTH level. There is no significant change in large adrenal hyperplasia lesions although sexual characteristics and menstrual cycles have recovered. Through this case and literature review, it can be concluded that CAH with 17α-OHD can be diagnosed according to the genetic detection.",['Tian Y; Hou L; Xiang S; Tian X; Xu J'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37683689,a 24-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with limb numbness. the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation detection. the patient was treated with prednisone acetate and estradiol valerate.
Health seeking behaviour associated with obstetric fistula care in Guinea: An analysis of the 2018 Demographic and Health survey.,"This study aimed to analyze factors associated with obstetric fistula care-seeking behavior in Guinea, based on data from the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey. Women aged 15-49 years who reported having obstetric fistula constituted the study population, statistical analysis was using Stata 16.0 software. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with fistula care-seeking behavior. Among women with obstetric fistula, 78.9% sought care; 21.1% of those who sought care underwent repair. Factors associated with care-seeking behavior were being divorced (AOR =8.08; 95% CI:1.56-41.84), having a job (AOR =3.23; 95% CI: 1.11-9.44), being a member of a poor household (AOR =6.49; 95% CI:1.21-34.82) and whose fistula had appeared 6 days or more after the occurrence of the causal circumstance (AOR =3.63 95% CI: 1.28-10.28). This study suggests that the foundations on which fistula prevention and treatment programs are built should be reviewed, taking into account the factors highlighted by this study.",['Diallo R; Camara BS; Sidibé T; Kourouma K; Camara S; Keita KS; Barry F; Touré M; Baldé M; Balde MD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097972,study aimed to analyze factors associated with obstetric fistula care-seeking behavior in Guinea. women aged 15-49 years who reported having obstetric fistula constituted the study population.
P300 regulates histone crotonylation and preimplantation embryo development.,"Histone lysine crotonylation, an evolutionarily conserved modification differing from acetylation, exerts pivotal control over diverse biological processes. Among these are gene transcriptional regulation, spermatogenesis, and cell cycle processes. However, the dynamic changes and functions of histone crotonylation in preimplantation embryonic development in mammals remain unclear. Here, we show that the transcription coactivator P300 functions as a writer of histone crotonylation during embryonic development. Depletion of P300 results in significant developmental defects and dysregulation of the transcriptome of embryos. Importantly, we demonstrate that P300 catalyzes the crotonylation of histone, directly stimulating transcription and regulating gene expression, thereby ensuring successful progression of embryo development up to the blastocyst stage. Moreover, the modification of histone H3 lysine 18 crotonylation (H3K18cr) is primarily localized to active promoter regions. This modification serves as a distinctive epigenetic indicator of crucial transcriptional regulators, facilitating the activation of gene transcription. Together, our results propose a model wherein P300-mediated histone crotonylation plays a crucial role in regulating the fate of embryonic development.",['Gao D; Li C; Liu SY; Xu TT; Lin XT; Tan YP; Gao FM; Yi LT; Zhang JV; Ma JY; Meng TG; Yeung WSB; Liu K; Ou XH; Su RB; Sun QY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080296,"histone crotonylation exerts pivotal control over diverse biological processes. spermatogenesis, cell cycle processes, and gene transcriptional regulation remain unclear. crotonylation is a transcription coactivator."
"""See-and-Treat"" Hysteroscopy in the Management of Endometrial Polyps.","Endometrial polyps (EPs) are a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and are typically suggested by a screening transvaginal ultrasound. In addition, the increasing use of pelvic imaging often discloses asymptomatic EPs. In the past, saline infusion sonography (SIS) has been advocated in order to triage patients to undergo a blind curettage or a diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy. The introduction of small diameter hysteroscopes and resectoscopes-often no larger than a SIS catheter-now allows most women with abnormal ultrasound findings to undergo a single-stage ""see-and-treat"" hysteroscopy for the management of endometrial polyps. In order to provide optimal management of endometrial polyps, however, a variety of known and unknown factors must be considered prior to ""see-and-treat"" hysteroscopy. For a woman wishing to preserve or enhance her fertility, hysteroscopic polypectomy-with care to avoid collateral endometrial damage-remains the standard of care. However, the literature reveals three issues that are important to address. First, that many premalignant and malignant lesions are found at the polyp base. Second, that there is a significant recurrence risk following simple polypectomy; this is especially true in tamoxifen-treated women. Third, that polypectomy alone is often insufficient for the satisfactory management of AUB. By offering a variety of options to women undergoing hysteroscopic polypectomy-including partial or total endomyometrial resection-the author addresses many of the limitations of traditional polypectomy. Moreover, the use of small diameter hysteroscopes and resectoscopes allow these procedures to be performed as a single stage ""see-and-treat"" hysteroscopy in the comfort and safety of an office-based setting.",['Wortman M'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121409,saline infusion sonography has been advocated in order to triage patients. hysteroscopic polypectomy-with care to avoid collateral endometrial damage-remains standard of care. hysteroscopic polypectomy-with care to avoid collateral endometrial damage-remains standard of care.
Assessing the impact of inland navigation on the faecal pollution status of large rivers: A novel integrated field approach.,"The contribution of ships to the microbial faecal pollution status of water bodies is largely unknown but frequently of human health concern. No methodology for a comprehensive and target-orientated system analysis was available so far. We developed a novel approach for integrated and multistage impact evaluation. The approach includes, i) theoretical faecal pollution source profiling (PSP, i.e., size and pollution capacity estimation from municipal vs. ship sewage disposal) for impact scenario estimation and hypothesis generation, ii) high-resolution field assessment of faecal pollution levels and chemo-physical water quality at the selected river reaches, using standardized faecal indicators (cultivation-based) and genetic microbial source tracking markers (qPCR-based), and iii) integrated statistical analyses of the observed faecal pollution and the number of ships assessed by satellite-based automated ship tracking (i.e., automated identification system, AIS) at local and regional scales. The new approach was realised at a 230 km long Danube River reach in Austria, enabling detailed understanding of the complex pollution characteristics (i.e., longitudinal/cross-sectional river and upstream/downstream docking area analysis). Faecal impact of navigation was demonstrated to be remarkably low at regional and local scale (despite a high local contamination capacity), indicating predominantly correct disposal practices during the investigated period. Nonetheless, faecal emissions were sensitively traceable, attributable to the ship category (discriminated types: cruise, passenger and freight ships) and individual vessels (docking time analysis) at one docking area by the link with AIS data. The new innovative and sensitive approach is transferrable to any water body worldwide with available ship-tracking data, supporting target-orientated monitoring and evidence-based management practices.",['Steinbacher SD; Ameen A; Demeter K; Lun D; Derx J; Lindner G; Sommer R; Linke RB; Kolm C; Zuser K; Heckel M; Perschl A; Blöschl G; Blaschke AP; Kirschner AKT; Farnleitner AH'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38996728,a novel integrated field approach was developed to assess the impact of navigation on the faecal pollution status of large rivers. the approach includes theoretical faecal pollution source profiling (PSP) for impact scenario estimation and hypothesis generation.
Impact of an advanced hybrid closed-loop system on glycemic control throughout the menstrual cycle in women with type 1 diabetes prone to hypoglycemia.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) on glycemic control throughout the menstrual cycle (MC) in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We included 39 pairs of spontaneous MC from 13 participants, before and after switching from sensor-augmented pump to AHCL. Baseline time below range <70 mg/dL (TBR<70) was significantly higher during the mid-follicular phase than during late luteal phase (5.7±5.0% vs. 4.1±3.0%), but similar time in range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) was observed throughout the MC. After switching to AHCL, a reduction in TBR<70 and an increase in TIR were observed in all phases. Phase-dependent changes in insulin infusion were detected and pre-existing differences in TBR<70 were eradicated (3.5±3.2% vs. 3.0±3.0%). However, TIR became significantly higher during the early follicular than during the late luteal phase (79.1±9.3% vs. 74.5±10.0%). In conclusion, AHCL improved glycemic control throughout the MC, but performance differed according to phase.",['Mesa A; Solà C; Vinagre I; Roca D; Granados M; Pueyo I; Cabré C; Conget I; Giménez M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38441905,study aimed to evaluate the impact of advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) on glycemic control throughout the menstrual cycle (MC) in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
Knowledge on ethnogynaecology of Indian Tribes- a comprehensive review.,"Ethnogynaecology is an emerging branch of science dealing with the treatment of gynaecological ailments by tribals, local healers, and traditional practitioners. The ethnogynaecological importance of medicinal plants in India is a fertile area to conduct more scientific studies to evaluate their potentialities, to isolate bioactive compounds, and thereby to develop drugs for the common gynaecological health-related issues faced by women everywhere. The Indigenous medical knowledge systems of India have not been properly documented with special reference to ethnogynaecology. This review aims to document the knowledge of ethnogynaecology among tribals, villagers, and local people inhabiting different parts of India and the bioactive compounds responsible for the action. This review provides a vast record of medicinal plants and their parts used, types of formulations, dosage, and ethno-gynaecological usage. The detailed investigation of ethnobotanical and ethnogynaecological-related literature published between 1985 and 2021 by different scientific tools such as journals, books, and current electronic databases like Springer Link, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Wiley, ACS, Science Direct and Pubmed have been considered for the present study. The study included 300 articles published between 1985 and 2021 by scientific search using various standard databases. The tribals, vaidyas, traditional practitioners, indigenous medical healers, and local people of different regions in India have recognized the importance of ethnogynaecological uses of plants. The study on ethnogynaecology is limited to a few common but significant gynaecological issues including abortion, contraception, infertility, menstruation, leucorrhoea, and obstetrics. The phytocompound compounds isolated from various parts of the plants and responsibility for the gynaecological action were documented. The major ethnogynaecological disorders recorded by various studies are leucorrhoea, abortion, contraceptives, infertility and related issues, and obstetrics including the irregular physiological process of menstruation. The ethnogynaecological and ethnobotanical information has been recorded from almost all the states of India; the highest number of records on ethnogynaecology was reported from the state of Madhya Pradesh. The most explored tribal populations to record ethnogynaecological knowledge belong to the following tribes: Bhil, Munda, Irula, Kani, Malayali, Meena, Paliyar, Muthuvar, Oraon, Narikuravar, Mannan, Malayarayan, and Malapandaram. Moreover, limited or no study has been attempted to prove the knowledge of ethnogynaecology of these tribes and the efficiency of their crude drugs against pharmacological actions. The paste prepared from various parts of the plants has been used widely as primary health care materials for abortion, obstetrics, menstruation, female infertility and male infertility. Phenols, glucoside, steroids and fatty acids reported with cytotoxic activities are connected to several gynaecological disorders whereas flavonoid, coumarin, sitosterol disrupt pregnancy. The phenolic compounds induced spontaneous abortion due to the major composition aristolochic acid, ceryl alcohol, β-sitosterol. Coreopsin, butin, isobutrin, monospermoside, palastrin, butrin. Mucunine, lecithin, prurieninine, gluthione and luteolin, Indicine, kaempferol, apigenin and quercetin effected therapeutic activity against leucorrhoea. Lignin, friedelin and beta-sitosterol are reported with abortifacient properties and therapeutic ability for leucorrhoea and menorrhagia. Tannins, mimusopsic acids, taraxerol and spinaserol effected fertility problems in women and tannins, saponins, flavonoids, steroids, terpenoids and alkaloids which effected infertility. This review reported comprehensive data on ethnogynaecological knowledge published from available literature and evident that the indigenous medical system of Indian tribes has also contributed considerably to the healthcare system and drug development of India. The fresh plant parts were identified as effective materials against various gynaecological illnesses including infertility. The root is considered an excellent plant part against obstetrics followed by abortion, menstruation, and leucorrhoea. These studies need experimental proof as well as standardization to confirm their efficiency. Promoting the sustainable use and the equitable sharing of benefits to the knowledge provider is a pathway for harnessing the conservation of this knowledge.",['Surendran S; Prasannan P; Jeyaram Y; Palanivel V; Pandian A; Ramasubbu R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36368564,ethnogynaecology of Indian tribals is a comprehensive review. the ethnogynaecological importance of medicinal plants in india is a fertile area to conduct more scientific studies. the indigenous medical knowledge systems of India have not been properly documented with special reference to ethnogynaecology.
Menstrual Cycle Phase has no Influence on Performance-Determining Variables in Endurance-Trained Athletes: The FENDURA Project.,"To investigate the effect of the MC and endogenous sex hormone concentrations on performance-determining variables in three distinct MC phases in endurance-trained females. Twenty-one eumenorrheic trained/highly trained endurance athletes completed a standardized test battery during the early follicular phase (EFP), ovulatory phase (OP), and mid-luteal phase (MLP) for either one (n = 7) or two test cycles (n = 14). MC phases were determined using calendar-based counting, urinary ovulation testing, and verified with serum hormone analysis. MCs were retrospectively classified as eumenorrheic or disturbed. Disturbed MCs were excluded from analysis. The test battery consisted of 4-6 x 5-min submaximal stages with stepwise speed increases, a 30-s all-out double-poling ski ergometer test, and a maximal incremental treadmill running test. At a group level, there was no effect of MC phase or the serum concentrations of estrogen and progesterone on peak oxygen uptake ( O 2peak ), oxygen uptake at 4 mmol·L -1 blood lactate concentration, time-to-exhaustion, running economy, or mean 30-s power output (MPO 30s ). Serum testosterone concentration was positively associated with MPO 30s (p = 0.016). Changes in O 2peak from EFP to MLP were inconsistent between individuals and across cycles. None of the measured performance-determining variables were influenced by MC phase or serum estrogen or progesterone concentrations. While some individual patterns could be observed, there was no indication that any single MC phase is consistently associated with improved or impaired O 2peak on a group level.",['Taylor MY; Osborne JO; Topranin VM; Engseth TP; Solli GS; Valsdottir D; Andersson E; Øistuen GF; Flatby I; Welde B; Morseth B; Haugen T; Sandbakk Ø; Noordhof DA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38600646,"menstrual cycle phase has no influence on performance-determining variables.

Determination of the rat estrous cycle vased on EfficientNet.,"In the field of biomedical research, rats are widely used as experimental animals due to their short gestation period and strong reproductive ability. Accurate monitoring of the estrous cycle is crucial for the success of experiments. Traditional methods are time-consuming and rely on the subjective judgment of professionals, which limits the efficiency and accuracy of experiments. This study proposes an EfficientNet model to automate the recognition of the estrous cycle of female rats using deep learning techniques. The model optimizes performance through systematic scaling of the network depth, width, and image resolution. A large dataset of physiological data from female rats was used for training and validation. The improved EfficientNet model effectively recognized different stages of the estrous cycle. The model demonstrated high-precision feature capture and significantly improved recognition accuracy compared to conventional methods. The proposed technique enhances experimental efficiency and reduces human error in recognizing the estrous cycle. This study highlights the potential of deep learning to optimize data processing and achieve high-precision recognition in biomedical research. Future work should focus on further validation with larger datasets and integration into experimental workflows.",['Pu X; Liu L; Zhou Y; Xu Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39119352,rat is widely used as experimental animals due to their short gestation period. rat is widely used as experimental animals due to their strong reproductive ability.
Curcuminoid-Piperine Combination Improves Radical Scavenging Activity in Women with Premenstrual Syndrome and Dysmenorrhea: A Post-hoc Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Study.,"Oxidative stress maybe involved in the patho-etiology of menstrual-associated complications. Curcuminoids, are polyphenolic natural compounds that have potentially important functional activities. This triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to investigate the effects of a curcuminoids on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in girls with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and dysmenorrhea. Eighty young girls with both PMS and dysmenorrhea were randomly given either curcuminoids (500 mg+5 mg piperine) or a placebo daily, for a period from 7 days pre- until 3 days post- initiation of menstrual bleeding for 3 successive menstrual cycles. The total antioxidant capacity and free radical scavenging activity of serum and urine were quantified via ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods, respectively. There were no significant differences between the placebo and curcumin groups, with respect to the age, dietary intake and biochemical/anthropometric indices (p>0.05). The curcumin treatment significantly increased the free-radical scavenging activity of serum compared to the treatment with placebo (p=0.031). Although, no significant changes were found in serum and urinary levels of FRAP, DPPH and MDA between the groups (p>0.05). Curcumin treatment did increase free-radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential in girls with PMS and dysmenorrhea. Investigations with higher doses and duration of curcumin are required to verify our findings.",['Karbasi S; Seyedabadi S; Mozaffari S; Foroutan Z; Ferns GA; Zarban A; Bahrami A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38841613,curcuminoids are polyphenolic natural compounds that have potentially important functional activities. curcuminoids are polyphenolic natural compounds that have potentially important functional activities. curcuminoids are polyphenolic natural compounds that have potentially important functional activities.
Women's attitudes about combined hormonal contraception (CHC) - induced menstrual bleeding changes - influence of personality traits in an Italian clinical sample.,"We investigated the attitudes to change the frequency of menstrual bleeding by using combined hormonal contraception (CHC). Personality characteristics were also explored. We conducted a cross-sectional study in two university hospitals in northern Italy. Current, past and never CHC users (<i>n</i> = 545; age 18-44 years) completed a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). Forty-five percent of responders (<i>n</i> = 301) would prefer to change their bleeding frequency by using CHC. A flexible regimen was the preferred choice (<i>n</i> = 80; 33%) followed by extended regimens to bleed every 3 months (<i>n</i> = 54; 22%) or to never bleed (<i>n</i> = 43; 18%). The main positive reasons were to avoid dysmenorrhea (43%) and have more freedom in sexual (36%) and active (35%) life, whereas the main reason for a negative attitude was 'menstrual rhythm is natural' (59%). Age had a significant influence on women's willingness to change menstrual frequency by using CHC [>39 years (57%), 30-39 years (31%) and <30 years (46%)] (χ<sup>2</sup>: 9.1; <i>p</i> = 0.01). Never users significantly reported a more negative attitude (71%) in comparison with past (51%) and current users (49%) (χ<sup>2</sup>: 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Personality traits played a role, with higher scores of openness (<i>p</i> = 0.005) and extraversion (<i>p</i> = 0.001) in women with a positive attitude. Almost half of our study sample reported a preference for changing their menstrual pattern by using CHC. Flexibility was the preferred choice across age and use of CHC.

A machine learning based method for tracking of simultaneously imaged neural activity and body posture of freely moving maggot.,"To understand neural basis of animal behavior, it is necessary to monitor neural activity and behavior in freely moving animal before building relationship between them. Here we use light sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM) combined with microfluidic chip to simultaneously capture neural activity and body movement in small freely behaving Drosophila larva. We develop a transfer learning based method to simultaneously track the continuously changing body posture and activity of neurons that move together using a sub-region tracking network with a precise landmark estimation network for the inference of target landmark trajectory. Based on the tracking of each labelled neuron, the activity of the neuron indicated by fluorescent intensity is calculated. For each video, annotation of only 20 frames in a video is sufficient to yield human-level accuracy for all other frames. The validity of this method is further confirmed by reproducing the activity pattern of PMSIs (period-positive median segmental interneurons) and larval movement as previously reported. Using this method, we disclosed the correlation between larval movement and left-right asymmetry in activity of a group of unidentified neurons labelled by R52H01-Gal4 and further confirmed the roles of these neurons in bilateral balance of body contraction during larval crawling by genetic inhibition of these neurons. Our method provides a new tool for accurate extraction of neural activities and movement of freely behaving small-size transparent animals.",['Huang Z; Sun Y; Liu S; Chen X; Ping J; Fei P; Gong Z; Zheng N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941792,"LSFM and microfluidic chip simultaneously capture neural activity and body movement of freely behaving maggot. using light sheet fluorescence microscope, we develop a transfer learning based method to simultaneously capture neural activity and body movement in small freely behaving maggot."
The female athlete triad: review of current literature.,"Adolescence and young adulthood are a critical period in the life of women for optimizing long-term bone health. Young athletes lead a demanding lifestyle with increased dietary requirements to meet the robust demands of energy expenditure to maintain a state of energy balance. During a time of fast paced changes and unpredictable societal demands on young athletes, it is important to review the severe consequences of energy deficiency and options for adequate management. This review focuses on hormonal adaptations that occur in energy deficient female athletes that lead to menstrual irregularities and impaired bone health, increasing the risk for stress and other fractures. We also describe management strategies to mitigate the consequences of limited energy availability on bone and other outcomes. These strategies should help guide the management of young female athletes to prevent irreversible changes to their bone health.

The impact of estrous cycle on anxiety-like behaviour during unlearned fear tests in female rats and mice: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Anxiety fluctuates across the human menstrual cycle, with symptoms worsening during phases of declining or low ovarian hormones. Similar findings have been observed across the rodent estrous cycle, however, the magnitude and robustness of these effects have not been meta-analytically quantified. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of estrous cycle effects on anxiety-like behaviour (124 articles; k = 259 effect sizes). In both rats and mice, anxiety-like behaviour was higher during metestrus/diestrus (lower ovarian hormones) than proestrus (higher ovarian hormones) (g = 0.44 in rats, g = 0.43 in mice). There was large heterogeneity in the data, which was partially accounted for by strain, experimental task, and reproductive status. Nonetheless, the effect of estrous cycle on anxiety-like behaviour was highly robust, with the fail-safe N test revealing the effect would remain significant even if 21,388 additional studies yielded null results. These results suggest that estrous cycle should be accounted for in studies of anxiety in females. Doing so will facilitate knowledge about menstrual-cycle regulation of anxiety disorders in humans.",['Pestana JE; Graham BM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39002829,estrous cycle effects on anxiety-like behaviour in rats and mice. a systematic review and meta-analysis of effects on anxiety-like behaviour. the effect of estrous cycle on anxiety-like behaviour was highly robust.
Hysteroscopic myomectomy: a comprehensive review of surgical techniques.,"Hysteroscopic myomectomy currently represents the standard minimally invasive surgical procedure for treating submucous fibroids, with abnormal uterine bleeding and reproductive issues being the most common indications. While hysteroscopic myomectomy has been shown to be safe and effective in the control of menstrual disorders, its effects on infertility remain unclear. The review provides a comprehensive survey of all hysteroscopic techniques used to treat fibroids found completely within the uterine cavity (G0) and those with intramural development (G1 and G2). MEDLINE and EMBASE searches identified published papers from 1970. The choice of the technique mostly depends on the intramural extension of the fibroid, as well as on personal experience and available equipment. 'Resectoscopic slicing' still represents the 'gold standard' technique for treating fibroids G0, even if several other effective techniques including ablation by neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, morcellation and office myomectomy have been proposed. On the other hand, the present review clearly indicates that there is still no single technique proven to be unequivocally superior for treating fibroids G1 and G2. Most techniques aim at the transformation of an intramural fibroid into a totally intracavitary lesion, thus avoiding a deep cut into the myometrium. At present, the 'cold loop' technique seems to represent the best option as it allows a safe and complete removal of such fibroids in just one surgical procedure, while respecting the surrounding healthy myometrium.",['Di Spiezio Sardo A; Mazzon I; Bramante S; Bettocchi S; Bifulco G; Guida M; Nappi C'],2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18063608,hysteroscopic myomectomy is the standard minimally invasive surgical procedure for treating submucous fibroids. hysteroscopic myomectomy is safe and effective in the control of menstrual disorders. but its effects on infertility remain unclear.
Nonclassic Adrenal Hyperplasia (NCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: A cohort of 78 patients.,"Diagnosis of nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) may be challenging due to its occult manifestations. To characterize clinical and molecular features of NCAH patients due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, we retrospectively included 78 NCAH patients. Their phenotype and genotype were presented and compared. The transcription activities of novel CYP21A2 promoter variants were investigated using a dual-reporter luciferase assay system. This cohort included 53 females (68 %) and 25 males (32 %). The median of onset age was 13 years old (female: 13 range from 7 to 38; male: 11 range from 6 to 71). Menstrual cycle disorder was the most common complaint in females (62 %, n = 33) and for males, it was adrenal incidentalomas (52 %, n = 13). A total of 17 (22 %) patients complained of infertility. The most frequently variant was p.Ile173Asn (20 %, n = 31). Importantly, five variants in the promoter region including - 103/- 126 and - 196/- 296 were found in 21 (27 %) patients. Patients with promoter variants showed older onset age and less impaired hormone levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, ACTH, progesterone, and androstenedione. Compared with the wild-type promoter, the basic transcription activity of - 103/- 126 and - 196/- 296 promoter variants were reduced by 57% and 25%, respectively. Therefore, females with menstrual cycle disorders or infertility and males with adrenal incidentaloma should be considered of NCAH due to 21-OHD. When genotyping patients with NCAH, the promoter region of the CYP21A2 gene should be also investigated.",['Wan Z; Wang W; Zheng S; Han R; Xie X; Zhao Y; Wang W; Sun S; Ye L'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36167262,nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) may be challenging due to its occult manifestations. phenotype and genotype were presented and compared. median of onset age was 13 years old.
An Emergency Department Quality Improvement Project to Decrease Lumbar Puncture Rates in Febrile Infants 22 to 28 Days Old.,"Most providers have routinely performed universal lumbar puncture (LP) on well-appearing, febrile infants 22 to 28 days old. In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended clinicians should perform an LP in this age group if inflammatory markers are abnormal. This quality improvement project aimed to decrease LP rates in febrile infants 22 to 28 days old in the emergency department (ED) within 1 year, regardless of race/ethnicity, from a baseline of 87%. We used our institution's quality improvement framework to perform multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. A multidisciplinary team reviewed the febrile infant literature, local epidemiology, and identified key drivers. We provided departmental education, updated our clinical pathway, and used clinical decision support. We analyzed baseline (January 2017-March 2022) and intervention data (April 2022-March 2024) and tracked data using statistical process control charts. Our primary outcome measure was rates of LP in the ED for this cohort. Process measures included rates of infants with procalcitonin results. ED length of stay, rates of first LP attempt after hospitalization, and missed bacterial meningitis were balancing measures. The baseline LP rate of 87% decreased to 44% during the intervention period, resulting in a downward centerline shift. There were no significant differences when LP rates were analyzed by race/ethnicity. There was an upward centerline shift in the process measure of infants with procalcitonin results. There was no observed special cause variation in our balancing measures. Quality improvement efforts, including education, clinical pathway updates, and clinical decision support, safely reduced rates of LPs in febrile infants 22 to 28 days old.",['Kelly JM; Ku BC; Gala P; Hawkins B; Lee B; Corso S; Green R; Scarfone R; Lavelle JM; Kane ER; Sartori LF'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39035453,a quality improvement project aimed to decrease LP rates in febrile infants 22 to 28 days old. the project aimed to decrease LP rates in febrile infants 22 to 28 days old. the baseline LP rate of 87% decreased to 44% during the intervention period.
Doctors and patients: gender interaction in the consultation.,"Much research on gender differences in medicine has centered on women as better communicators, more egalitarian, more patient-centered, and more involved with psychosocial problems, preventive care, and female-specific problems. Hardly any research has examined the interaction between the doctor's gender and the patient's gender. The authors examined students' perceptions and comfort levels regarding patients' gender during consultation. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to survey final-year medical students at one school in 1999. It tested students' patient-centeredness, ""patient-care"" values, and degree of comfort in performing certain intimate physical examinations. Women students were more patient-centered than were men students. Both genders were more attuned to the concerns of patients of their own gender, were more comfortable with personal rather than sexual issues, and were more uncomfortable with performing more intimate examinations upon the opposite gender. Using comparable case studies, it was also shown that the female student-female patient dyad had significantly greater ""patient-care"" values than did the male student-male patient dyad. Medical students did not behave in a gender-neutral way in the consultation. There is a powerful interaction between a student's gender and a patient's gender. This warrants further investigation in the real clinical situation because it has implications on the outcomes of the consultation.",['Zaharias G; Piterman L; Liddell M'],2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14744716,research on gender differences in medicine has centered on women as better communicators. women students were more patient-centered than men students. both genders were more patient-centered than men students.
Comparing local perspectives on women's health with statistics on maternal mortality: an ethnobotanical study in Bénin and Gabon.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), reproductive health problems are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for women in Africa. In spite of this scenario and the importance of plants in African health care, limited research has been conducted linking maternal health and plant-based medicine. The objective of our research was to examine how closely Beninese and Gabonese women's health perspectives, medicinal plant knowledge, and plant use practices reflect the statistical causes of maternal mortality. In Bénin (2011) and Gabon (2012), we conducted 87 ethnobotanical questionnaires with the corresponding collection of 800 botanical specimens. We used free-listing analysis, citation frequency and species counts to determine women's top health concerns. We also interviewed 18 biomedical healthcare providers in national hospitals and local clinics. Informants' perceptions of the main causes of maternal suffering included malaria, infertility, and menstruation and pregnancy concerns. Women were knowledgeable on plants to treat the top causes of maternal morbidity, but knew more plants for conditions such as anemia, infertility, breast milk production, and the maintenance of menstruation and pregnancy. The biomedical staff recognized the role of traditional medicine in their patients' lives and expressed concern for herbal remedies to facilitate birth, but were restricted by national policies on advising on medicinal plant use. Plants serve as an entry point to understanding Beninese and Gabonese women's perceptions of common health concerns and local health management strategies. Plant use practices in both countries did not closely parallel the top statistical causes of maternal mortality, but highlighted key issues such as menstruation and infertility as salient health concerns for women. More research is needed on the role of plants in women's gynecological healthcare.",['Towns AM; van Andel T'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24679004,87 ethnobotanical questionnaires were conducted in Bénin and gabon. the study examined the health of women in the u.s. and britain.
Managing epilepsy in women of childbearing age.,"Epilepsy affects the menstrual cycle, aspects of contraception, fertility, pregnancy and bone health in women. It is common for seizure frequency to vary throughout the menstrual cycle. In ovulatory cycles, two peaks can be seen around the time of ovulation and in the few days before menstruation. In anovulatory cycles, there is an increase in seizures during the second half of the menstrual cycle. There is also an increase in polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism associated with valproate therapy. There are no contraindications to the use of non-hormonal methods of contraception in women with epilepsy. Non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [valproate, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, tiagabine and zonisamide] do not show any interactions with the combined oral contraceptive (OC). There are interactions between the combined OC and hepatic microsomal-inducing AEDs (phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, topiramate [dosages>200 mg/day], oxcarbazepine) and lamotrigine. Pre-conception counselling should be available to all women with epilepsy who are considering pregnancy. Women with epilepsy should be informed about issues relating to the future pregnancy, including methods and consequences of prenatal screening, fertility, genetics of their seizure disorder, teratogenicity of AEDs, folic acid and vitamin K supplements, labour, breast feeding and care of a child. During pregnancy, the lowest effective dose of the most appropriate AED should be used, aiming for monotherapy where possible. Recent pregnancy databases have suggested that valproate is significantly more teratogenic than carbamazepine, and the combination of valproate and lamotrigine is particularly teratogenic. Most pregnancies in women with epilepsy are without complications, and the majority of infants are delivered healthy with no increased risk of obstetric complications in women. There is no medical reason why a woman with epilepsy cannot breastfeed her child. The AED concentration profiled in breast milk follows the plasma concentration curve. The total amount of drug transferred to infants via breast milk is usually much smaller than the amount transferred via the placenta during pregnancy. However, as drug elimination mechanisms are not fully developed in early infancy, repeated administration of a drug such as lamotrigine via breast milk may lead to accumulation in the infant. Studies have suggested that women with epilepsy are at increased risk of fractures, osteoporosis and osteomalacia. No studies have been undertaken looking at preventative therapies for these co-morbidities.",['Crawford PM'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19388721,"epilepsy affects the menstrual cycle, aspects of contraception, fertility, pregnancy and bone health in women. it is common for seizure frequency to vary throughout the menstrual cycle. there is also an increase in polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism associated with valproate therapy."
"[Preoperative treatment of uterine fibroids with low-dose mifepristone: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study].","<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of oral mifepristone (10 mg/day) versus placebo in the preoperative treatment of uterine fibroids. <b>Methods:</b> This study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo, parallel controlled trial. A total of 132 patients with uterine fibroids were randomly divided into study group and control group, with 66 cases in each group. The patients in the study group orally took 1 tablet/day of mifepristone (dose of 10 mg/tablet), the patients in the control group orally took 1 tablet/day of placebo, and both groups were treated for 3 months. The primary efficacy evaluation indicators were the change rate of maximum fibroid volume; the secondary efficacy evaluation indicators included amenorrhea rate, improvement of subjective symptoms and anemia; the safety evaluation indicators included the analysis of adverse events and changes in laboratory biochemical indicators. <b>Results:</b> At the end of treatment, the maximum leiomyoma volume was reduced by 25.97% (95%<i>CI</i>: -34.79%--15.95%) in the study group and reduced by 1.51% (95%<i>CI</i>: -13.03%-11.54%) in the control group. The change rate of the maximum leiomyoma volume before and after treatment in the study group was significantly greater than that in the control group, and the difference in the change rate of the maximum leiomyoma volume between the two groups was -24.84% (95%<i>CI</i>: -36.56%--10.94%), which was much higher than the 10% superiority threshold goal set by this study within the 95%<i>CI</i> interval. At the end of treatment, the complete amenorrhea rate [84% (52/62)], dysmenorrhea elimination rate [98% (61/62)], and menstrual blood loss disappearance rate [87% (54/62)] in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all <i>P</i><0.05). At the end of treatment, the mean hemoglobin [(131±13) g/L], red blood cell count [(4.5±0.4)×10<sup>12</sup>/L] and hematocrit (0.39±0.03) in the study group were significantly increased compared with the baseline, and the differences had statistical significance (all <i>P</i><0.05); after treatment, the differences in the above three indicators between the two groups had statistical significance (all <i>P</i><0.01). The serum estradiol level in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group at the end of treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.01). There were no significant differences in follicle-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels before and after treatment between the two groups (<i>P</i>>0.05). The overall incidences of any adverse event were not significantly different between the two groups (all <i>P</i>>0.05). Abdominal pain was the most common adverse event in the study group [9% (6/65)], but the incidence was not significantly increased compared with the control group [3% (2/64); <i>P</i>>0.05]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with placebo, oral mifepristone 10 mg/day is significantly superior to placebo in reducing the size of uterine fibroids and improving anemia, without significant adverse reactions, and could be used as a drug treatment for patients with of uterine fibroids before surgery.",['Bian ML; Huang ML; Zhang ZY; Liu SM; Sun J; Fang F; Gu YP; Liu CD; Yao C'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34034418,"132 patients with uterine fibroids were randomly divided into study group and control group. mifepristone (10 mg/day) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel controlled trial."
The differences between adults and adolescents using a mobile health application for menstrual complaints: A usability and qualitative study.,"A ""Menstruatie Educatie Kalender"" application (Menstruation Education Calendar, (MEK-APP)) was developed for adults to evaluate menstrual complaints. The future aim of this app is to use it as a self-diagnostic instrument for menstrual abnormalities for both adults and adolescents. Early identification of the potential of an application for future use by both user groups would increase implementation success and adoption of the application. To compare differences in experienced usability by adults versus adolescents and to identify factors influencing future use for both age groups in one mHealth application (in this study the MEK-APP). This study consisted of three phases: (1) usability testing of the MEK-APP for iOS and Android by think-aloud method, (2) two-month daily use and (3) in-depth individual interview. During the think-aloud sessions, twelve tasks were performed in the application while they were thinking aloud. Usability problems were rated for their severity with Nielsen' Severity Scale. Both the think-aloud sessions and in-depth interviews were verbatim transcribed and thematically analyzed to determine the factors influencing future use for both groups. In addition, the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaires were filled out during the interviews. Seven adults (>18 years) and seven adolescents (14-18 years) evaluated the MEK-APP. There were 14 usability issues and 16 bugs in both groups. There were no differences between adults and adolescents. In the thematic qualitative analysis, the following future use factors were identified: user-expectation, motivation, privacy, understandability, and user-experience. The user-expectation, motivation and privacy differed between both groups but did not influence usage. No differences were observed in SUS and IMI scores between both groups. There are five factors influencing the future use of a menstrual-related mHealth application for both adults and adolescents.

Human mobility patterns in Brazil to inform sampling sites for early pathogen detection and routes of spread: a network modelling and validation study.,"Detecting and foreseeing pathogen dispersion is crucial in preventing widespread disease transmission. Human mobility is a fundamental issue in human transmission of infectious agents. Through a mobility data-driven approach, we aimed to identify municipalities in Brazil that could comprise an advanced sentinel network, allowing for early detection of circulating pathogens and their associated transmission routes. In this modelling and validation study, we compiled a comprehensive dataset on intercity mobility spanning air, road, and waterway transport from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (2016 data), National Transport Confederation (2022), and National Civil Aviation Agency (2017-23). We constructed a graph-based representation of Brazil's mobility network. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm was used to rank the 5570 Brazilian cities according to their suitability as sentinel locations, allowing us to predict the most suitable locations for early detection and to track the most likely trajectory of a newly emerged pathogen. We also obtained SARS-CoV-2 genetic data from Brazilian municipalities during the early stage (Feb 25-April 30, 2020) of the virus's introduction and the gamma (P.1) variant emergence in Manaus (Jan 6-March 1, 2021), for the purposes of model validation. We found that flights alone transported 79·9 million (95% CI 58·3-101·4 million) passengers annually within Brazil during 2017-22, with seasonal peaks occurring in late spring and summer, and road and river networks had a maximum capacity of 78·3 million passengers weekly in 2016. By analysing the 7 746 479 most probable paths originating from source nodes, we found that 3857 cities fully cover the mobility pattern of all 5570 cities in Brazil, 557 (10·0%) of which cover 6 313 380 (81·5%) of the mobility patterns in our study. By strategically incorporating mobility patterns into Brazil's existing influenza-like illness surveillance network (ie, by switching the location of 111 of 199 sentinel sites to different municipalities), our model predicted that mobility coverage would have a 33·6% improvement from 4 059 155 (52·4%) mobility patterns to 5 422 535 (70·0%) without expanding the number of sentinel sites. Our findings are validated with genomic data collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period. Our model accurately mapped 22 (51%) of 43 clade 1-affected cities and 28 (60%) of 47 clade 2-affected cities spread from São Paulo city, and 20 (49%) of 41 clade 1-affected cities and 28 (58%) of 48 clade 2-affected cities spread from Rio de Janeiro city, Feb 25-April 30, 2020. Additionally, 224 (73%) of the 307 suggested early-detection locations for pathogens emerging in Manaus corresponded with the first cities affected by the transmission of the gamma variant, Jan 6-16, 2021. By providing essential clues for effective pathogen surveillance, our results have the potential to inform public health policy and improve future pandemic response efforts. Our results unlock the potential of designing country-wide clinical sample collection networks with mobility data-informed approaches, an innovative practice that can improve current surveillance systems.

Emerging cancer disease burden in a rural sub-Saharan African population: northeast Nigeria in focus.,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is plagued by myriads of diseases, mostly infectious; but cancer disease burden is rising among non-communicable diseases. Nigeria has a high burden of cancer, however its remote underserved culturally-conserved populations have been understudied, a gap this study sought to fill. This was a cross-sectional multi-institutional descriptive study of histologically diagnosed cancers over a four-year period (January 2019-December 2022) archived in the Departments of Pathology and Cancer Registries of six tertiary hospitals in the northeast of Nigeria. Data obtained included age at diagnosis, gender, tumor site and available cancer care infrastructure. Population data of the study region and its demographics was obtained from the National Population Commission and used to calculate incident rates for the population studied. A total of 4,681 incident cancer cases from 2,770 females and 1,911 males were identified. The median age at diagnosis for females was 45 years (range 1-95yrs), and 56 years (range 1-99yrs) for males. Observed age-specific incidence rates (ASR) increased steadily for both genders reaching peaks in the age group 80 years and above with the highest ASR seen among males (321/100,000 persons) compared to females (215.5/100,000 persons). Breast, cervical, prostatic, colorectal and skin cancers were the five most common incident cancers. In females, breast, cervical, skin, ovarian and colorectal cancers were the top five malignancies; while prostate, haematolymphoid, skin, colorectal and urinary bladder cancers predominated in men.

Reproductive cancer risk factors among Alaska Native women: the Alaska Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH) Study.,"The purpose of this study was to provide estimates for the prevalence of reproductive cancer risk factors among Alaska Native (AN) women who enrolled in the Alaska Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH) Study from 2004 to 2006. A total of 2,315 AN women 18 years or older completed reproductive health questions as part of a comprehensive health history questionnaire. The reproductive health section included menstrual status (age at menarche and menopause), pregnancy and live birth history, use of hormonal contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and history of hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. A total of 463 (20%) of women experienced menarche before age 12 with a decline in mean age at menarche by age cohort. More than 86% had been pregnant (mean number of pregnancies, 3.8; mean number of live births, 2.9). More than one half of women (58%) had their first live birth between the ages of 18 and 24. Almost 28% of participants had completed menopause, of whom 24% completed menopause after age 52. Fewer than half (43%) reported ever using hormone replacement therapy. Almost two thirds (62%) reported ever using oral contraceptives, and fewer reported ever using birth control shots (30%) or implants (10%). This study is unique in reporting reproductive health factors among a large group of AN women. These data show that AN women have selective protective factors for reproductive cancers, including low nulliparity rates, low use of menopausal estrogens, and common use of contraceptive hormones. However, analysis by age cohorts indicates decreasing age at menarche that might increase the risk for reproductive cancers among AN women in the future.",['Redwood DG; Lanier AP; Johnston JM; Murphy N; Murtaugh MA'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22609255,"a total of 2,315 AN women 18 years or older completed reproductive health questions. the reproductive health section included menstrual status, pregnancy and live birth history, hormonal contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and history of hysterectomy. more than one half of women (58%) had their first live birth between the ages of 18 and 24."

"Protective effect of rutin on acrylamide induced ovarian inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and hormonal changes: Based on in silico and in vivo study.","Acrylamide (AA) is a carcinogenic compound that affects people due to its frequent use in laboratories and industry as well as the high-temperature cooking of foods with high hydrocarbon content. AA is known to cause severe reproductive abnormalities. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of rutin (RU), a phytoactive compound, against AA-induced reproductive toxicity in female rats. Initially, rats were exposed to AA (40 mg/kg for 10 days). Therapy of RU was given after AA intoxication consecutively for 3 days. After 24 h of the last treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. The study evaluated reproductive hormones, oxidative stress markers, membrane-bound enzymes, DNA damage, histological findings, and an in silico approach to determine the protective efficacy of RU. The results indicated that RU significantly protected against inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage induced by AA, likely due to its antioxidant properties.",['Gupta D; Shrivastava S; Kumar S; Bhardwaj G; Jain C; Kumar S; Tonk R; Shukla S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39095945,rutin (RU) is a phytoactive compound that affects people due to its frequent use in laboratories and industry. a study evaluated the protective effect of a phytoactive compound against AA-induced reproductive toxicity in female rats.
Prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding and associations with physical health and wellbeing in low-income and middle-income countries: a multinational cross-sectional study.,"Data on the prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are scarce. We aimed to assess the validity of a scale to measure heavy menstrual bleeding and calculate its prevalence in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and to examine associations between heavy menstrual bleeding and health outcomes. Between Aug 2, 2021 and June 14, 2022, we surveyed 6626 women across ten cities (Meherpur and Saidpur, Bangladesh; Warangal, Narsapur, and Tiruchirappalli, India; Kathmandu, Nepal; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Kampala, Uganda; and Lusaka, Zambia), including questions on demographics, health, and the SAMANTA scale, a six-item measure of heavy menstrual bleeding. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis to assess construct validity of the SAMANTA scale, calculated the prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding, and used regression analyses to examine associations of heavy menstrual bleeding with health outcomes. 4828 women were included in the final analytic sample. Factor analysis indicated a one-factor model representing heavy menstrual bleeding. In the pooled analytic sample, 2344 (48·6%) of 4828 women were classified as experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding, and the prevalence was lowest in Dakar (126 [38·3%] of 329 women) and Kampala (158 [38·4%] of 411 women) and highest in Kathmandu (326 [77·6%] of 420 women). Experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding was significantly associated with feeling tired or short of breath during the menstrual period (risk ratio 4·12 (95% CI 3·45 to 4·94) and reporting worse self-rated physical health (adjusted odds ratio 1·27, 95% CI 1·08 to 1·51), but was not associated with subjective wellbeing (β -3·34, 95% CI -7·04 to 0·37).

[Challenges of menstruation in girls and adolescents from rural communities of the Colombian Pacific].,"To understand the challenges and experiences related to menstruation in girls and adolescents from rural communities of the Colombian Pacific. Mixed research, mainly qualitative and quantitative to a lesser extent, which combined ecological, differential and intercultural approaches, as well as gender perspective. The participants were girls and adolescents, young people, teachers/principals of educational institutions, mothers and parents in general, as well as institutional officers from the Municipal Health and Education Secretariats, the Ministries of Health and Education, and the Vice-ministry of Water and Sanitation. Focus groups, in-depth interviews, surveys and the educational institutions were carried out in schools. The research was conducted in the municipalities of Bagadó (Chocó), Ipiales (Nariño) and Santander de Quilichao (Cauca). This study showed that insufficient information at the time of menarche, pain, poor access to restrooms, water and absorbent materials, as well as existing prejudices, cause menstruation to be experienced with pain and concealment. All these aspects are correlated with absenteeism in school and the strengthening of prejudices around ""being a woman"". Inequality in girls and adolescents, derived from constructs around menstruation, goes unnoticed by schools, families, entities and officers in charge of public policy management. Social and cultural constructs around menstruation in the municipalities studied lead to its configuration as a negative experience, which generates and reinforces taboos that materialize in inequity, stigma and discrimination against girls. In this context, community work and the design of public policies and actions are fundamental to promote gender equity.",['Ariza-Ruiz LK; Espinosa-Menéndez MJ; Rodríguez-Hernández JM'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30183839,"women and adolescents from rural communities of the Colombian Pacific are facing challenges. mixed research combined ecological, differential and intercultural approaches. insufficient information at the time of menarche, pain, poor access to restrooms, water and absorbent materials cause menstruation to be experienced with pain and concealment."
Genetic predictors of blood pressure traits are associated with preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension after 20 gestational weeks, is a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Mechanisms leading to preeclampsia are unclear; however, there is evidence of high heritability. We evaluated the association of polygenic scores (PGS) for blood pressure traits and preeclampsia to assess whether there is shared genetic architecture. Non-Hispanic Black and White reproductive age females with pregnancy indications and genotypes were obtained from Vanderbilt University's BioVU, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network, and Penn Medicine Biobank. Preeclampsia was defined by ICD codes. Summary statistics for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and pulse pressure (PP) PGS were acquired from Giri et al. Associations between preeclampsia and each PGS were evaluated separately by race and data source before subsequent meta-analysis. Ten-fold cross validation was used for prediction modeling. In 3504 Black and 5009 White included individuals, the rate of preeclampsia was 15.49%. In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, all PGSs were associated with preeclampsia (OR<sub>DBP</sub> = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, p = 7.68 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; OR<sub>SBP</sub> = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.23, p = 2.23 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; OR<sub>PP</sub> = 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.27, p = 9.86 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Addition of PGSs to clinical prediction models did not improve predictive performance. Genetic factors contributing to blood pressure regulation in the general population also predispose to preeclampsia.",['Jasper EA; Hellwege JN; Breeyear JH; Xiao B; Jarvik GP; Stanaway IB; Leppig KA; Chittoor G; Hayes MG; Dikilitas O; Kullo IJ; Holm IA; Verma SS; Edwards TL; Velez Edwards DR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080328,"preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension after 20 gestational weeks. it is a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. mechanisms leading to preeclampsia are unclear; however, there is evidence of high heritability."
Effects of SARS-COVID-19 lockdown on menstrual patterns: A transversal large sample survey.,"To elucidate the presence, importance, and characteristics of menstrual changes related to stressful circumstances during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. An online survey was administered in Spain to menstruating women aged 15-55 who had not contracted COVID-19. It collected information on activities during the lockdown, sexual activity, perceptions of emotional status, any changes in menstrual characteristics, and impact on quality of life. The analysis of menstrual changes was limited to responders who did not use hormonal contraception. A total of 6449 women answered the survey, and 4989 surveys were valid for the final analysis. 92.3% of women had at least one menstruation period during the lockdown, while 7.7% had amenorrhea. Quality of life (QoL) associated with menstruation worsened in 19% of women, did not change in 71.7%, and improved in 1.6%. For 50.1% of the women, global QoL worsened during the lockdown; 41.3% remained about the same and 8.7% reported improvement. Sexual activity during the lockdown decreased in 49.8% of the respondents, remained unchanged in 40.7%, and increased in 9.5%. As far the menstrual changes are concerned, there were no statistically significant differences in amenorrhea incidence, regularity of the menstrual cycle, or the amount or duration of menstrual bleeding in non-hormonal contraceptive users when evaluated by the length and characteristics of isolation, the perception of exposure to COVID-19 and the economic or employment situation. Conversely, we found statistically significant differences according to the intensity of changes in emotional status due to lockdown stressors and changes in regularity, duration, and heaviness of menstruation. Changes in emotional status, but not the length and intensity of the isolation or exposure to the disease, significantly influenced menstrual disturbances during the COVID-19 lockdown.",['Calaf J; Perelló-Capó J; Gich-Saladich I; Lete I; Novalbos J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38614906,"online survey was administered in spanish to menstruating women aged 15-55. it collected information on activities during the lockdown, sexual activity, perception of emotional status, and impact on quality of life. 92.3% of women had at least one menstruation period during the lockdown."
Kidney outcomes are altered by preconception weight modulation in rodent mothers with obesity.,"Obesity increases the risk of chronic kidney disease. We have previously demonstrated the benefits of preconception maternal weight loss on fertility and pregnancy outcomes in a mouse model of maternal obesity. Here, we elucidate if preconception weight loss, either by diet modification or the glucose-like peptide 1 agonist liraglutide, used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity, improves maternal kidney outcomes in late gestation. C57BL/6 female mice were fed either a high-fat-diet (HFD) or a chow (control) diet for 8 weeks. To induce pre-pregnancy weight loss, HFD-fed dams were switched to chow diet (HFD-C) or administered liraglutide (0.3 mg/kg subcutaneous) whilst continuing on HFD (HFD-L). Liraglutide was discontinued one week prior to mating. HFD-V mice continued on HFD, with saline injections. A group of HFD-fed dams were 'diet switched' to chow after conception (post-conception, HFD-PC). Maternal body weight and glucose tolerance were measured: (1) preconception and (2) during late gestation followed by blood, urine and kidney collection. Serum creatinine, urinary creatinine and albumin, kidney tissue gene expression and protein were measured. In the preconception period, HFD-L and HFD-C mothers have lower urine albumin:creatinine ratios (UACR) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein expression (P < 0.005 vs. HFD-V). At late gestation, kidneys of HFD-V and HFD-PC dams have increased gene expression of insulin receptor and FAS (P < 0.05) and higher UACR compared to controls (P < 0.01). In the HFD-PC group, kidneys show increased mRNA and protein expression of metabolic and oxidative stress markers (FAS, 8-OHdG vs. control, P < 0.05, P < 0.0001 respectively). The preconception intervention groups with liraglutide, or diet change show reduced oxidative stress (protein expression of 8-OHdG, P < 0.05 vs. HFD), mRNA and protein expression of FAS (P < 0.05 vs. HFD), protein expression of fibrosis markers (collagen IV, fibronectin vs. HFD, P < 0.05), and UACR (P < 0.05 vs. HFD).

[Comparative Study of the Embryo Development and Clinical Outcomes of 3 Ovarian Stimulation Protocols in Different Age Groups].,"The main purpose of this study is to compare the embryo development and clinical outcomes of women in different age groups undergoing <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) processes using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol, GnRH agonist long protocol, and early follicular phase protocol. We aim to provide reliable reference for future clinical treatments. We conducted a detailed analysis of patients who underwent treatment between January 2021 and February 2023. 1) In the overall patient population, we comprehensively compared the basic characteristics, the embryo development, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated with three different ovarian stimulation protocols, including the GnRH antagonist protocol group (<i>n</i>=4173), the agonist long protocol group (<i>n</i>=2410), and the early follicular phase long protocol group (<i>n</i>=341). 2) We divided the overall population into three age groups, one group for patients under 30 years old (<i>n</i>=2576), one for patients aged 30-35 (<i>n</i>=3249), and one for patients older than 35 years old (<i>n</i>=1099). Then, we compared the three stimulation protocols based on the group division. We separately compared the embryo development and clinical outcomes of patients using the three stimulation protocols in the under 30 years old, the 30-35 years old, and the over 35 years old age groups. With this analysis, we aimed to explore the response of different age groups to different stimulation protocols and their impact on the success rate of IVF. 1) In the overall population, we found that the average number of oocytes retrieved in the GnRH agonist long protocol group was significantly higher than that in the GnRH antagonist protocol group ([13.85±7.162] vs. [13.36±7.862], <i>P</i>=0.0224), as well as the early follicular phase long protocol group ([13.85±7.162] vs. [11.86±6.802], <i>P</i><0.0001). Patients in the GnRH antagonist protocol group not only had a significantly lower starting dose of gonadotrophin (Gn) compared to the other two groups (<i>P</i><0.05) but also had a significantly lower number of days of Gn use (<i>P</i><0.05). The blastocyst formation rate in the GnRH antagonist protocol group was the highest among the three groups, significantly higher compared to the GnRH agonist long protocol group (64.91% vs. 62.35%, <i>P</i><0.0001) and the early follicular phase long protocol group (64.91% vs. 61.18%, <i>P</i>=0.0001). However, there were no significant differences in the clinical pregnancy rates or the live birth rates among the three groups treated with different ovarian stimulation protocols (<i>P</i>>0.05). 2) In the <30 age group, the blastocyst formation rate in the GnRH antagonist protocol group was the highest among the three groups, significantly higher compared to the GnRH agonist long protocol group (66.12% vs. 63.33%, <i>P</i><0.0001) and the early follicular phase long protocol group (66.12% vs. 62.13%, <i>P</i>=0.0094). In the 30-35 age group, the blastocyst formation rate in the GnRH antagonist protocol group was the highest among the three groups, significantly higher compared to the GnRH agonist long protocol group (64.88% vs. 62.93%, <i>P</i>=0.000 9) and the early follicular phase long protocol group (64.88% vs. 60.39%, <i>P</i>=0.0011). In the >35 age group, the blastocyst formation rate in the GnRH antagonist protocol group was significantly higher than that in the GnRH agonist long protocol group (59.83% vs. 56.51%, <i>P</i>=0.0093), while there was no significant difference compared to that of the early follicular phase long protocol group (<i>P</i>>0.05). In the three age groups, we found that there were no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and neonatal outcome indicators (fetal weight and Apgar score) among the three stimulation protocols (antagonist protocol, GnRH agonist long protocol, and early follicular phase long protocol) (<i>P</i>>0.05). The findings showed no significant differences between clinical and neonatal outcomes in patients of all ages, regardless of the ovarian stimulation protocol, suggesting that the three ovarian stimulation protocols have similar therapeutic effects in patients of different ages. The results of this study have important implications for the selection of an appropriate ovarian stimulation protocol and the prediction of treatment outcomes. In the younger than 30 and 30-35 age groups, the GnRH antagonist protocol showed a more significant advantage over the GnRH agonist long protocol and the early follicular phase long protocol. This suggests that for younger and middle-aged patients, the antagonist protocol may lead to better outcomes during ovarian stimulation. In the older than 35 age group, while the antagonist protocol still outperformed the GnRH agonist long protocol, there was no significant difference compared to the early follicular phase long protocol. This may imply that with increasing age, the early follicular phase long protocol may have effects similar to the antagonist protocol to some extent. The advantages of the antagonist protocol lie in its ability to reduce stimulation duration and the dosage of GnRH, while enhancing patient compliance with treatment. This means that patients may find it easier to accept and adhere to this treatment protocol, thereby improving treatment success rates. Particularly for older patients, the use of the antagonist protocol may significantly increase the blastocyst formation rate, which is crucial for improving the success rates. Although there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes of patients treated with the three protocols in each age group, further research is still needed to validate these findings. Future multicenter studies and increased sample sizes may help comprehensively assess the efficacy of different stimulation protocols. Additionally, prospective studies are needed to further validate these findings and determine the optimal treatment strategies.",['Fan Y; Zhang W; Zhang Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38948300,study compared embryo development and clinical outcomes of women in different age groups using three different ovarian stimulation protocols. compared the three stimulation protocols based on the group division.
Proteomics of appetite-regulating system influenced by menstrual cycle and intensive exercise in female athletes: a pilot study.,"Female athletes who endure intense training are at risk of developing the 'female athlete triad,' making energy intake management crucial. However, the fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone levels throughout the menstrual cycle present a challenge in maintaining consistent energy intake. This study aimed to uncover the underlying factors associated with appetite regulation linked to menstrual phases and exercise using proteomic approach. Five female athletes engaged in 60 min of bicycle exercise, followed by 90 min of rest, during both the follicular and luteal phases. Serum samples were collected before, during, and after exercise, and the serum proteome was analyzed using 2D-gel electrophoresis. A total of 511 spots were detected in the subjects' serum profiles, with significant decreases observed in haptoglobin during the luteal phase and complement component 3 during bicycle training. Unsupervised learning with a generalized estimating equation analysis showed that serum peptide YY (PYY), an appetite suppressor, significantly influenced the fluctuations of serum proteins induced by exercise (p < 0.05). Regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between PYY and serum IgM (R = 0.87), implying that the intestinal environment and the immune response in female athletes may contribute to appetite regulation.",['Tanabe K; Kamemoto K; Kawaguchi Y; Fushimi K; Wong SY; Ikegami N; Sakamaki-Sunaga M; Hayashi N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38378702,female athletes are at risk of developing the 'female athlete triad'. the fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone levels throughout the menstrual cycle present a challenge in maintaining consistent energy intake.
Adolescents with Special Needs: Clinical Challenges in Reproductive Health Care.,"Adolescents with special needs have unique reproductive health care needs related to their physical and cognitive issues. This review discusses some of the most common concerns that are encountered in clinical practice, as the clinician will partner with the adolescent and her family to guide her through the pubertal transition and to help navigate the risks and rights of reproduction. Families often seek anticipatory guidance before menarche on menstrual hygiene, abuse risk and sexuality and can be reassured that most teens with special needs do very well with menstruation. The clinician needs to evaluate the teenager's reproductive knowledge as well her risk for abuse and coercion and her ability to consent to sexual activity, if she requests contraception. Menstrual management is mostly based on the impact of the menstrual cycles on the teenager's life and activities. The adolescents may have a decreased ability to tolerate menses or pain, or experience changes in seizure pattern or altered mood. Hormonal treatment is often used to assist with menstrual hygiene, cyclical mood changes or dysmenorrhea. The goal of treatment can be complete amenorrhea, alleviate pain or regulate and decrease menstrual flow. The unique risks and benefits of hormonal treatment for this special population are highlighted.",['Quint EH'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26542013,clinician will partner with adolescent and her family to guide her through the pubertal transition. menstrual management is mostly based on the impact of the menstrual cycles on the teenager's life and activities.
The impact of pre-menarcheal training on menstrual practices and hygiene of Nigerian school girls.,"The menstrual practices of adolescents derive largely from health issues associated with their adjustment to reproductive life. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of pre-menarcheal training on the menstrual and hygiene practices of Nigerian school girls. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of randomly selected post-menarcheal school girls using a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire was done. The mean age of the school girls was 14.9 ± 1.7 years. Pre-menarcheal training was given to 273 (55.2%) of them. Mothers (74.7%) were the more common source of information. Inappropriate experience of menarche, adverse effect of menstruation on schooling and social life and the use of unhygienic menstrual absorbents were common in girls who had no pre-menarcheal training than those who did. Lack of timely information results in inappropriate menstrual experiences and poor menstrual hygiene practices. Ways to promote menstrual education and hygiene practices are suggested.",['Aniebue UU; Aniebue PN; Nwankwo TO'],2009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532905,"pre-menarcheal training was given to 273 (55.2%) of girls. mothers (74.7%) were the more common source of information. inappropriate experience of menarche, adverse effect of menstruation on schooling and social life were common in girls who had no pre-menarcheal training than those who did."
Subgroups of pelvic pain are differentially associated with endometriosis and inflammatory comorbidities: a latent class analysis.,"Chronic pelvic pain is heterogeneous with potentially clinically informative subgroups. We aimed to identify subgroups of pelvic pain based on symptom patterns and investigate their associations with inflammatory and chronic pain-related comorbidities. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified subgroups of participants (n = 1255) from the Adolescence to Adulthood (A2A) cohort. Six participant characteristics were included in the LCA: severity, frequency, and impact on daily activities of both menstruation-associated (cyclic) and non-menstruation-associated (acyclic) pelvic pain. Three-step LCA quantified associations between LC subgroups, demographic and clinical variables, and 18 comorbidities (10 with prevalence ≥10%). Five subgroups were identified: none or minimal (23%), moderate cyclic only (28%), severe cyclic only (20%), moderate or severe acyclic plus moderate cyclic (9%), and severe acyclic plus severe cyclic (21%). Endometriosis prevalence within these 5 LCA-pelvic pain-defined subgroups ranged in size from 4% in ""none or minimal pelvic pain"" to 24%, 72%, 70%, and 94%, respectively, in the 4 pain subgroups, with statistically significant odds of membership only for the latter 3 subgroups. Migraines were associated with significant odds of membership in all 4 pelvic pain subgroups relative to those with no pelvic pain (adjusted odds ratios = 2.92-7.78), whereas back, joint, or leg pain each had significantly greater odds of membership in the latter 3 subgroups. Asthma or allergies had three times the odds of membership in the most severe pain group. Subgroups with elevated levels of cyclic or acyclic pain are associated with greater frequency of chronic overlapping pain conditions, suggesting an important role for central inflammatory and immunological mechanisms.",['Ghiasi M; Chang C; Shafrir AL; Vitonis AF; Sasamoto N; Vazquez AI; DiVasta AD; Upson K; Sieberg CB; Terry KL; Holzman CB; Missmer SA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38563996,subgroups of pelvic pain differentially associated with endometriosis. latent class analysis identified subgroups of participants. six participants characteristics included in the LCA.
Chronic endometritis - a constantly discussed issue in infertile women.,"A review of current knowledge on the pathophysiology, diagnostic and treatment options for chronic endometritis in infertile women. One of the major causes of failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) is undiagnosed intrauterine pathologies, including chronic inflammation of the uterine mucosa - chronic endometritis. However, some authors relativize the negative impact of chronic endometritis on reproductive outcomes. The etiopathogenesis of chronic endometritis is due to qualitative and quantitative changes in the endometrial microbiome with abnormal multiplication of microorganisms naturally occurring in the uterine cavity or vagina. There is no uniform consensus on the most common pathogen causing chronic endometritis. It is characterized by infiltration of plasma cells into the endometrial stroma outside the menstrual cycle, accompanied by hyperaemia and endometrial oedema. Clinical symptoms are very mild or absent. The diagnosis of chronic endometritis is often difficult because there is no specific clinical or laboratory diagnostic method. The following investigative options are commonly used for the diagnosis of chronic endometritis: diagnostic hysteroscopy, histopathological examination of the endometrium including CD 138 immunohistochemistry and culture from the uterine cavity. However, standardised international hysteroscopic and histopathological criteria for accurate diagnosis of chronic endometritis are still lacking. Empirically administered antibiotic therapy improves the success rate of pregnancy and delivery of a viable foetus in infertile patients with proven chronic endometritis. In addition to reviewing the current knowledge of chronic endometritis, this article discusses the importance of hysteroscopy in the diagnostic process. Chronic endometritis is often a clinically silent disease with negative impact on reproduction in infertile women. Although there are still many unresolved issues, the introduction of hysteroscopy into the diagnostic process is important for clinical practice; however, hysteroscopy even in combination with histological examination of the endometrium, often does not allow an unequivocal diagnosis of chronic endometritis. Further prospective randomised studies in a selected group of women with proven chronic endometritis and repeated failure to implant proven euploid embryos should refine this knowledge.",['Břečka K; Sehnal B; Maxová K; Halaška MJ; Keprtová K; Hruda M; Rob L; Mardešič T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38969519,chronic endometritis is a constantly discussed issue in infertile women. undiagnosed intrauterine pathologies include chronic inflammation of the uterine mucosa.
The Effect of the Menstrual Cycle on Energy Intake: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Energy intake may differ across the menstrual cycle, with some studies identifying greater energy intake in the luteal phase (LP) compared with the follicular phase (FP) and others finding no clear differences. To date, no study has systematically synthesized the available data to draw more definite conclusions while considering any methodological inconsistencies between studies. The aim was to conduct a systematic review/meta-analysis in an effort to determine if there are differences in energy intake between the FP and LP. A systematic search strategy was developed and the search was conducted in 5 databases for studies that investigated any changes in energy intake across menstrual phases. Using Covidence, studies were identified and included if they contained individuals between the ages of 18 and 45 years, maintained an average body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-25 kg/m2, had no history of disordered eating, and included energy intake and menstrual cycle measurements in the FP and LP. Effect sizes were calculated for each study and a random-effects model was used to pool the results of each study. Fifteen datasets were included consisting of 330 female participants with a mean age of 26 ± 4 years and mean BMI of 22.4 ± 2.3 kg/m2. Overall, there was a statistically significant difference (standardized mean difference = 0.69; P = .039) with increased energy intake in the LP compared with the FP (crude 168 kcal⋅d-1 average difference between phases). Energy intake was found to be greater in the LP compared with the FP, providing insight into the effect of the menstrual cycle on energy intake. However, there were repeated methodological inconsistencies and future work should strive to utilize best practices for both energy intake measurement and menstrual phase specification.",['Tucker JAL; McCarthy SF; Bornath DPD; Khoja JS; Hazell TJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39008822,study aims to determine if there are differences in energy intake between menstrual phases. a systematic review/meta-analysis was conducted in 5 databases. a systematic search strategy was developed and the search was conducted.
Exploring factors influencing health-related quality of life in adult females with injuries: a cross-sectional nationwide study.,"This study aimed to identify the types of injury experiences affecting adult females and the associations between injury experiences and health-related quality of life. This study used a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which employed a stratified multistage probability sampling design to obtain nationally representative data. Health-related quality of life was measured with the EuroQol Five-Dimension and consisted of mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Among women aged 19-64, the prevalence of injury experience was 5.9%. Women's injury experience varied by age, subjective health perception, menstruation details, osteoporosis status, and osteoarthritis status. The following injury experience-related factors were significantly associated with health-related quality of life: self-care (odds ratio [OR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.60), usual activity (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.27-0.70), and pain/discomfort (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44-0.72). Health-related quality of life among adult women was significantly associated with injury experience. The results of this study highlight risk factors for injury that are associated with aging, such as menopause, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. Accurate assessments of pain and discomfort, as well as daily activities, are essential for designing effective interventions for injured women. Tailored training and education can promote self-management and improve outcomes for recovery.",['Kwak Y; Jang I'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37860800,cross-sectional nationwide study aimed to identify types of injury experiences affecting adult females. study used a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Korea national health and nutrition examination survey. health-related quality of life was measured with the EuroQol Five-Dimension.
Uterine peristalsis in women affected by adenomyosis: A step towards functional assessment.,"The non-pregnant uterus shows an intrinsic contractility pattern, actively involved in early reproductive processes. Uterine contractility is characterized by endometrial waves that originate from the junctional zone and varies throughout the menstrual cycle due to fluctuations in the concentrations of hormones. The aim of this study was to compare the uterine contractility patterns in the periovulatory phase in a group of patients with isolated adenomyosis and a group of healthy women using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). From March 2019 to March 2021, we enrolled consecutive nulliparous patients in the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, divided in patients with isolated adenomyosis (group A, n = 18) and healthy patients in the control group (group B, n = 18). Patients who met the inclusion criteria underwent TVUS for the study of uterine contractility: the uterus was scanned on sagittal plane for 3 min and all the movies were recorded. Then, static images and video were evaluated offline and the uterine contractility patterns were defined. The patients belonging to the study group had a higher incidence of painful symptoms (dysmenorrhea, 6.11 ± 2.81 vs 1.39 ± 2.17; chronic pelvic pain, 2.56 ± 3.01 vs 0.39 ± 1.04) and a larger uterine volume (137.48 ± 117.69 vs 74.50 ± 27.58 cm<sup>3</sup>; P = 0.04). Regarding the uterine contractility, a statistically significant difference was observed about the retrograde patterns (group A, 27.8% vs group B, 72.2%, P < 0.01) and opposing (group A, 38.9% vs, group B, 5.6%, P = 0.02). The study confirms the presence of altered uterine peristalsis in the periovulatory phase in patients with adenomyosis. The abnormal uterine peristalsis could lead to both structural and functional changes, which are the basis of the clinical manifestations of adenomyosis and the perpetuation of the anatomical damage.",['Arena A; Zanello M; Orsini B; Degli Esposti E; Iodice R; Altieri M; Borgia A; Moro E; Seracchioli R; Casadio P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38205860,"non-pregnant uterus shows intrinsic contractility pattern, actively involved in early reproductive processes. uterine contractility is characterized by endometrial waves that originate from the junctional zone."
Application of strain elastography ultrasound to the endometrium of normal women.,"While there is a scarcity of studies utilizing strain elastography (SE) for the endometrium, commonly used gynecologic ultrasound instruments are equipped with built-in elastography modalities, primarily SE. With the objective of facilitating comprehensive examinations for gynecologic patients on a single ultrasound instrument, we undertook this study. Therefore, our aim was to study the value of SE ultrasonography in the assessment of endometrial elasticity in normal women. Three hundred and twenty normal women were recruited at our hospitals from November 2021 to December 2022. Each volunteer underwent a transvaginal two-dimensional (2D) and SE ultrasound during either the endometrial proliferative or secretory phase. The 2D ultrasound indices obtained included endometrial thickness, echo type (type A, B, and C), and blood flow grading (grades 0, 1, 2, and 3). SE indices obtained included endometrial strain values, myometrial strain values, and endometrial strain ratios. Differences in endometrial ultrasound indices between different menstrual cycles and different age groups were compared. Comparison of 2D ultrasound parameters revealed that endometrial thickness in the proliferative phase endometrium group was smaller than that in the secretory phase endometrium group, with a statistically significant difference. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in endometrial echo types between the two groups, while the disparity in endometrial blood flow grading was not significant. Regarding SE parameters, the median and mean values of endometrial strain ratio in the proliferative phase endometrium group were smaller than those in the secretory phase endometrium group, showing a statistically significant difference. However, there were no significant differences observed between the two groups in endometrial strain and myometrial strain in the fundus. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in any of the endometrial ultrasound indices among the different age groups. SE can reflect changes in endometrial stiffness in different menstrual cycles and is an important tool for assessing endometrial softness.",['Shen G; Zhang X; Qin L; Wu Y; Li H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38902645,strain elastography ultrasound is used to assess endometrial elasticity in normal women. the results were compared to the secretory phase endometrium group. the difference in endometrial thickness was smaller than that in the secretory phase endometrium group.

An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out in the family planning unit of the study institution from April 2021 to October 2022 among 200 women of reproductive age. Each of the mothers was administered a researcher-administered questionnaire containing questions pertaining to their sociodemographic characteristics and Antara use experience. The mean age of the study participants was 26.4 ± 5.9 years. Most of the participants were Hindus (55.0%), homemakers by their occupation (86.0%), and from lower socio-economic status. A significant proportion of the women had no formal education (14.0%) or had below primary education (14.5%). The most common reason provided by the participants for the discontinuation of Antara was the incidence of various side effects such as irregular menstruation, amenorrhea and apprehension. Lower educational status (<i>p</i> value < 0.001), poorer socio-economic status (<i>p</i> value < 0.001), and interval period starting of Antara (<i>p</i> value < 0.001) were statistically significantly associated with the discontinuation of the contraceptive. Most women who started taking DMPA (Antara) discontinued due to the fear of side effects. Therefore, the focus should be to educate women regarding the benefits and side effects of DMPA through proper counselling.",['Ray S; Sing K; Biswas T; Manepalli ST; Chaturvedi A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38974744,DMPA is an injectable contraceptive with well-proven effectiveness and excellent safety profile. it is marketed as Antara in India as part of the government's family planning programme.
Gynecological issues after organ transplantation.,"Organ transplantation has become universally accepted treatment of end-stage organ failure. The main problem focuses on preventing the graft from rejection with the use of immunosuppressive agents. High incidence of infection is the most frequent adverse effect of immunosuppressive therapy. Symptoms of inflammation are often reduced in immunosuppressed patients. All invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures should be associated with the increase in dose of steroids and prophylactic antibiotics. Ovarian and menstrual function is usually restored in transplanted women. Function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis in transplanted women is believed to be normal. Most common abnormal uterine bleeding in graft recipient are: prolonged and profuse menstruation and inter-menstrual bleeding or spotting. Among the underlying diseases are lesions of the uterus (fibroids, endometrial or cervical polyps), infections of sex organs or hormonal disturbances. Higher rate of endometrial hyperplasia (without atypia) is reported in renal graft recipients. Organ transplantation results in the restored fertility thus effective family planning method is necessary in women of reproductive age who do not want to conceive. Vaginal diaphragms are not advised and intrauterine device are contradicted. Observational studies indicate for safety and high rate of acceptance of oral and transdermal hormonal contraception in transplanted women. Over ten-year experiences of HRT administration in graft recipient have proved the benefits of the therapy. Patients after organ transplantation have three to four-fold increased incidence of malignancy compared with general population. All transplant women must undergo regular gynecological screening for premalignant and malignant lesions of sex organs and breast.",['Kaminski P; Bobrowska K; Pietrzak B; Bablok L; Wielgos M'],2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19112398,high incidence of infection is the most frequent adverse effect of immunosuppressive therapy. ovarian and menstrual function is usually restored in transplanted women.
Diagnostic tests for progestogen hypersensitivity.,"Progesterone is an endogenous hormone, produced by the adrenal cortex, the gonads and in women, its source is the corpus luteum. Progesterone is produced in the late phase of the menstrual cycle, when implantation of the zygote does not occur, the corpus luteum involutes and the release of progesterone is suppressed, thus initiating menstruation. Progestogen Hypersensitivity were initially identified as hormone allergy and were related to endogenous reactions to hormones and alteration of ovarian function. Skin manifestations such as dermatitis or urticaria were initially reported and described as progesterone autoimmune dermatitis, although the immune-mediated mechanism was not clear. Currently there is no standardization for <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i> tests for Progestogen Hypersensitivity diagnosis. In this review, we will address the different diagnostic methods of this disease.",['Alonso Bello CD; González Guzmán OP; Moncayo Coello CV; Rojo Gutiérrez MI; Castrejón Vázquez MI'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38720769,"progesterone is an endogenous hormone, produced by the adrenal cortex, the gonads and in women. progesterone is produced in the late phase of the menstrual cycle. the corpus luteum involutes and the release of progesterone is suppressed."
Treatment strategies for infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder that can be diagnosed when two of the following three criteria are present: menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Factors such as the individual's body weight influence the severity of the phenotype and risk of metabolic comorbidities. While anovulatory infertility is a common issue among lean and obese reproductive-aged women with PCOS, obesity is associated with resistance to oral ovulation induction agents, lower pregnancy rates and a higher risk of pregnancy complications. Lifestyle modification is recommended as first line therapy among obese women with PCOS in order to optimize their outcomes. Among lean and obese women with PCOS, ovulation induction can be achieved with aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, insulin sensitizing agents, gonadotropins and ovarian drilling with varying rates of ovulation, live birth and multiple gestations. Assisted reproductive technologies are reserved for women who do not conceive despite restoration of ovulation or couples with additional factors contributing to their infertility. This review will outline treatment strategies for achieving a healthy pregnancy among lean and obese women with PCOS and infertility.",['Vitek W; Hoeger K; Legro RS'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26765152,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder that can be diagnosed when two criteria are present. factors such as the individual's body weight influence the severity of the phenotype and risk of metabolic comorbidities. lifestyle modification is recommended as first line therapy among obese women with PCOS in order to optimize their outcomes.
Menstrual health intervention and school attendance in Uganda (MENISCUS-2): a pilot intervention study.,"Achieving good menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a public health challenge and there is little evidence to inform interventions. The aim of this study was to pilot test an intervention to improve MHH and school attendance in Uganda, in preparation for a future cluster-randomised trial. Longitudinal study with pre-post evaluation of a pilot intervention. Two secondary schools in Entebbe, Uganda. Of the 473 eligible students in secondary 2 (S2) at baseline, 450 (95.1%; 232 girls and 218 boys) consented/assented. 369 students (188 girls; 81.0%; and 181 boys; 83.0%) participated in the endline survey. The intervention comprised training teachers to improve delivery of government guidelines for puberty education, training in use of a menstrual kit and pain management, a drama skit, provision of analgesics and improvements to school water and sanitation hygiene facilities. Feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention. Baseline and endline quantitative surveys were conducted, with qualitative interviews conducted at endline. School attendance was assessed using self-completed daily diaries among a nested cohort of 100 female students. There were high levels of uptake of the individual and behavioural intervention components (puberty education, drama skit, menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kit and pain management). The proportion of girls reporting anxiety about next period decreased from 58.6% to 34.4%, and reported use of effective pain management increased from 76.4% to 91.4%. Most girls (81.4%) reported improved school toilet facilities, which improved their comfort managing menstruation. The diary data and qualitative data indicated a potential intervention impact on improving menstrual-related school absenteeism. The pilot study showed that the multicomponent MHM intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver, and potentially effective in improving menstruation knowledge and management. A cluster-randomised trial is needed to evaluate rigorously the intervention effects on MHM and school attendance.

An investigation of endometrial vascularity in normally menstruating women and those in other physiological states using 3D ultrasound imaging.,"This study aimed to determine the normal vasculature indices of the endometrium and to correlate them with those in various physiological states. Women undergoing ultrasound at the Feto-Maternal Center, Qatar in 2020-2021 as part of their gynecologic evaluation were enrolled into the study. They were divided into those with normal menses and no additional pathology, those following spontaneous miscarriage, postpartum and menopausal. Three-dimensional (3D) evaluation of the endometrial vasculature was done and the parameters quantified included vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), vascularization flow index (VFI), endometrial thickness, endometrial volume and uterine volume. JASP, an open-source statistical analysis software, was used for analysis and an independent t-test to compare the vascularity indices. A multivariate regression analysis was also done to look at the factors affecting the endometrial vascular indices within the luteal phase. A total of 461 women were studied: 122 in the follicular phase, 199 in the luteal phase, 90 after a spontaneous miscarriage, 29 postpartum, and 16 menopausal. The vascularity indices were highest after miscarriage and lowest postnatally. There were no significant effects of age, gravida, para, or abortions on VI and VFI. However, there was a significant positive effect of age on FI (P = 0.019) There was a significant increase in endometrial volume and thickness in the luteal phase as compared to follicular phase (P < 0.01), but there was no difference in the vascularity indices. The uterine and endometrial volume in the postnatal group were nearly double that of the luteal group (P value <0.01 and 0.014, respectively). There was a significant decrease in flow index in the postnatal group compared to the luteal group (P < 0.01), suggesting low flow intensity in the postnatal group. Endometrial vascular indices measured using 3D Doppler can be used to determine normal vascular indices and vary with physiological states such as after miscarriages, postnatally and in the menopausal states.",['Khan AA; Al-Motawa A; Halabi N; Ahmed B; Rafii JA; Konje JC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38217113,"women undergoing ultrasound at the Feto-Maternal Center, Qatar, were enrolled in the study. they were divided into those with normal menses and no additional pathology, those following spontaneous miscarriage, postpartum and menopausal."
Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Epidemiology in Iranian Elderly Population; an Analysis of the Iranian National Registry for Cancer (2009-2014 Years).,"We aimed to investigate the patterns of incidence and prevalence of bone sarcoma (BS) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS), morphology as well as geographical distribution in the elderly in Iran. By the primary site of the tumor and the morphological types, whole cases of cancer were classified. Then, the WHO classification (2018) and the third revision of the standard International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) were used to assign a code to them. The estimated incidence rates were obtained as the frequency of the newly-diagnosed cases within one year divided by the calculated population of the mid-year Iranian residents as estimated by the Iranian Bureau of Statistics. The age-standardized incidence rates were also estimated for both bone and soft tissue sarcoma. The annual crude incidence rates of sarcomas in males (0.80 per 100,000) were more than in females (0.55 per 100,000) in all years. The total combined crude incidence in 2014 years was obtained at 0.67 per 100,000 people. In terms of disease grade majority of the patients were of grade 3 (11.5 %). In terms of tumor location, the Lower extremity was 16.8%, the Visceral (including gastrointestinal & uterus) 15.8%, the Thoracic 12.8%, and the Pelvic & abdominal wall 9.7%. Even though such sarcoma is more prevalent in elderly men, its incidence was also observed in lower-aged female groups. In addition, the incidence rate of BS was lower in comparison with that of STS, and the patients often exhibited an unknown degree of sarcoma.",['Akbari ME; Fararouei M; Kabiri LA; Karami M; Gheibi Z; Nikeghbalian Z; Maki A; Bashirpour MA; Moradian F; Ghelichi-Ghojogh M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39086408,"the average average incidence rate was 0.67 per 100,000 people. the average average sarcoma was 0.67 per 100,000 people."
Recommendations and Nutritional Considerations for Female Athletes: Health and Performance.,"Optimal nutrition is an important aspect of an athlete's preparation to achieve optimal health and performance. While general concepts about micro- and macronutrients and timing of food and fluids are addressed in sports science, rarely are the specific effects of women's physiology on energy and fluid needs highly considered in research or clinical practice. Women differ from men not only in size, but in body composition and hormonal milieu, and also differ from one another. Their monthly hormonal cycles, with fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, have varying effects on metabolism and fluid retention. Such cycles can change from month to month, can be suppressed with exogenous hormones, and may even be manipulated to capitalize on ideal timing for performance. But before such physiology can be manipulated, its relationship with nutrition and performance must be understood. This review will address general concepts regarding substrate metabolism in women versus men, common menstrual patterns of female athletes, nutrient and hydration needs during different phases of the menstrual cycle, and health and performance issues related to menstrual cycle disruption. We will discuss up-to-date recommendations for fueling female athletes, describe areas that require further exploration, and address methodological considerations to inform future work in this important area.",['Holtzman B; Ackerman KE'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515972,"women's physiology is an important aspect of an athlete's preparation for optimal health and performance. women differ from men in size, but in body composition and hormonal milieu. hormonal cycles, with fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, have varying effects on metabolism and fluid retention."
Long-distance communication can enable collective migration in a dynamic seascape.,"Social information is predicted to enhance the quality of animals' migratory decisions in dynamic ecosystems, but the relative benefits of social information in the long-range movements of marine megafauna are unknown. In particular, whether and how migrants use nonlocal information gained through social communication at the large spatial scale of oceanic ecosystems remains unclear. Here we test hypotheses about the cues underlying timing of blue whales' breeding migration in the Northeast Pacific via individual-based models parameterized by empirical behavioral data. Comparing emergent patterns from individual-based models to individual and population-level empirical metrics of migration timing, we find that individual whales likely rely on both personal and social sources of information about forage availability in deciding when to depart from their vast and dynamic foraging habitat and initiate breeding migration. Empirical patterns of migratory phenology can only be reproduced by models in which individuals use long-distance social information about conspecifics' behavioral state, which is known to be encoded in the patterning of their widely propagating songs. Further, social communication improves pre-migration seasonal foraging performance by over 60% relative to asocial movement mechanisms. Our results suggest that long-range communication enhances the perceptual ranges of migrating whales beyond that of any individual, resulting in increased foraging performance and more collective migration timing. These findings indicate the value of nonlocal social information in an oceanic migrant and suggest the importance of long-distance acoustic communication in the collective migration of wide-ranging marine megafauna.",['Dodson S; Oestreich WK; Savoca MS; Hazen EL; Bograd SJ; Ryan JP; Fiechter J; Abrahms B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937635,social information is predicted to enhance the quality of animals' migratory decisions. but the relative benefits of nonlocal information in the long-range movements of marine megafauna remain unknown.
A real-world disproportionality analysis of cyclosporine from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.,"Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants. This study aimed to assess the safety of cyclosporine through the analysis of adverse events (AEs) related to cyclosporine in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). To detect AEs associated with cyclosporine, a pharmacovigilance analysis was conducted using four algorithms on the FAERS database: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). A statistical analysis was performed on data extracted from the FAERS database, covering 19,582 case reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. Among these cases, 3,911 AEs were identified, with 476 linked to cyclosporine as the primary suspected drug. Cyclosporin-induced AEs targeted 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). Notably, the highest case at the SOC level included eye disorders, injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, as well as immune system disorders, all of which are listed on the cyclosporine label. Furthermore, we discovered novel potential AEs associated with hepatobiliary disorders, among others. Moreover, unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as biliary anastomosis complication and spermatozoa progressive motility decrease, were identified. Importantly, these newly identified ADRs were not mentioned on the cyclosporine label, which were involved in injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, and investigations at the SOC level. The study used pharmacovigilance analysis of FAERS database to identify new and unexpected potential ADRs relating to cyclosporine, which can provide safety tips for the safe use of cyclosporine.",['Cui S; Li L; Liu W; Zhao B; Zhong X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082578,"cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants. a real-world disproportionality analysis of cyclosporine was conducted using four algorithms on the FAERS database. a statistical analysis was performed on data extracted from the FAERS database covering 19,582 case reports spanning from 2013 to 2022."
Female Military Officers Report a Desire for Menstrual Suppression During Military Training.,"Service women face female-specific challenges that present physiological and logistical burdens and may impact readiness. The stress of training can change menstrual patterns and symptoms, and limited access to hygienic, private facilities can hinder menstrual management. Therefore, suppressing menses with continuous hormonal contraception may be of interest. The 9-item ""Military Women's Attitudes Toward Menstrual Suppression."" questionnaire was administered to female officers upon entry (baseline) and graduation (post) from a 6-month secondary training course. Respondents rated their attitudes about menstruation and the stress of training, the desire for menstrual suppression, and the logistical burden of menstruation on a 1 (strongly agree) through 5 (strongly disagree) scale. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests determined changes in the distribution of responses from baseline to post. Female officers (n = 108) completed baseline and post questionnaires (age 25.2 ± 0.3 years). At baseline, the majority disagreed/strongly disagreed that the stress of training ""makes periods worse than usual"" (n = 77, 71%), ""increases menstrual symptoms and bleeding"" (n = 77, 71%), or ""magnifies premenstrual syndrome"" (PMS; n = 69, 64%). Although 50% (n = 54) agreed/strongly agreed that ""stopping periods while women are training is a good idea,"" 37% (n = 40) disagreed/strongly disagreed. The majority agreed/strongly agreed that menstrual suppression would prevent ""the worry about menstrual supplies"" (n = 75, 70%) and ""the inconvenience of having a period during training"" (n = 69, 64%). Many agreed/strongly agreed that it is difficult to deal with periods during training because ""there is no privacy"" (n = 52, 48%), ""the inability to find adequate facilities"" (n = 70, 65%), and ""the lack of opportunity to use adequate facilities"" (n = 52, 48%). Opinions remained largely consistent from baseline to post. The desire for menstrual suppression among service women during training is high. Military health care providers should be prepared to counsel service women about strategies to manage menstruation, including the efficacy of continuous hormonal contraception for menstrual suppression. Future studies investigating benefits or risks of continuous hormonal contraception for menstrual suppression in service women should inform the clinical recommendations.",['Ricker EA; Goforth CW; Barrett AS; Deuster PA; de la Motte SJ'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33499478,"female officers report a desire for menstrual suppression during military training. stress of training can change menstrual patterns and symptoms. limited access to hygienic, private facilities can hinder menstrual management."
Effects of elevated serum estrogen on dry eye in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation.,"Sex hormones impact inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. During IVF (in vitro fertilisation) treatment, circulating estrogen levels increase dramatically (10-50x) alongside changes in other hormones. This study examined changes in dry eye with IVF and its relationship with sex hormones. A two visit study was conducted on first day of menstruation when estrogen levels are lowest (baseline visit), and on day 9-11 (peak estrogen visit (PO)) of IVF. Symptoms of dry eye and ocular pain and signs of dry eye were examined. Serum hormone levels were assessed using mass spectrometry and immunoassay. Changes in signs and symptoms and associations were explored. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis assessed factors contributing to signs and symptoms. 40 women (36.2 ± 4.0 years) completed the study. Baseline and PO oestradiol (E2) levels were 28.9 pg/ml (20) (median (IQR)); 1360 pg/ml (1276) respectively. Ocular pain and dry eye symptoms worsened (p = 0.02 and p < 0.01) and tear break up and tear secretion values decreased (p = 0.005 and 0.01) at PO. Higher E2 and lower luteinizing hormone (LH) were associated with worsening of dry eye symptoms (ρ = 0.34 p = 0.03, ρ = -0.49 p = 0.001). Reduction in LH and increase in progesterone (P4) were associated with increased ocular pain (ρ = 0.45, p = 0.004 and ρ = 0.39, p = 0.01). Dry eye symptoms were predicted by LH and tear break up (p = 0.02; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18). IVF treatment resulted in significantly increased ocular symptoms and tear film alterations although these changes were not clinically significant. Dry eye signs and symptoms were poorly predicted by hormone levels.",['Boga A; Stapleton F; Chapman M; Golebiowski B'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37422153,serum estrogen levels increase dramatically (10-50x) during in vitro fertilisation. circulating estrogen levels increase dramatically (10-50x). circulating estrogen levels increase (10-50x) alongside changes in other hormones.
Behavioural interventions for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea.,"Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynaecological condition with considerable morbidity. The behavioural approach assumes that psychological and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physiological processes. Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures and focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for dysmenorrhoeic symptoms rather than modification of any underlying organic pathology. To determine the effectiveness of any behavioural interventions for the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatments for example non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), Social Sciences Index (1980 to April 2005), PsycINFO (1972 to April 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005) and reference lists of articles. Randomised controlled trials comparing behavioural interventions with placebo or other interventions in women with dysmenorrhoea. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Five trials involving 213 women were included. Behavioural intervention vs control: One trial of pain management training reported reduction in pain and symptoms compared to a control. Three trials of relaxation compared to control reported varied results, two trials showed no difference in symptom severity scores however one trial reported relaxation was effective for reducing symptoms in menstrual sufferers with spasmodic symptoms. Two trials reported less restriction in daily activities following treatment with either relaxation of pain management training compared to a control. One trial also reported less time absent from school following treatment wit pain management training compared to a control. Behavioural intervention vs other behavioural interventions: Three trials showed no difference between behavioural interventions for the outcome of improvement in symptoms. One trial showed that relaxation resulted in a decrease in the need for resting time compared to the relaxation and imagery. There is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea however results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials.",['Proctor ML; Murphy PA; Pattison HM; Suckling J; Farquhar CM'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17636702,dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin. the behavioural approach assumes psychological and environmental factors interact with physiological processes. behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures.

"Prevalence of dysmenorrhea and associated factors and its effect on daily academic activities among female undergraduate students of Hawassa University College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Hawassa, Ethiopia.","Dysmenorrhea is pain during menstrual flow and is the most common gynecologic complaint in reproductive-age girls. The severity of dysmenorrhea ranges from mild to severe pain during menstruation, which affects their academic activities. To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of dysmenorrhea and its effects on academic activities among Hawassa University students from April 1-30/2021. A cross-sectional study was conducted and a systematic random sampling technique was used to select 348 study participants. Standardized self-administered questionnaires were used to obtain relevant data. The severity of pain was assessed using a verbal multidimensional scoring system and Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) methods. The collected data was entered into Epi info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis and then descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 80% (277). Of those affected by dysmenorrhea, using the verbal multidimensional scoring system, 47.6% (132) were found to have mild pain, 39.7% (110) had moderate pain, and 12.6% (35) had severe pain. However, using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), 21.7% (60) were found to have mild pain, 33.2% (92) had moderate pain, 37.5% (104) had severe pain, and 7.6% (21) had very severe pain. It was found to have a negative effect on academic activity, such as loss of concentration in class (<i>p</i> = 0.00), disruption of study time (<i>p</i> = 0.00), sleep disturbances (<i>p</i> = 0.00), issues in personal relationships (<i>p</i> = 0.00), and absenteeism (<i>p</i> = 0.00). Associated factors included being sexually active, having a family history of dysmenorrhea, and the presence of depression. Dysmenorrhea is prevalent in this study and has a significant impact on academic activities.

Does mode of follow-up influence contraceptive use after medical abortion in a low-resource setting? Secondary outcome analysis of a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.,"Post-abortion contraceptive use in India is low and the use of modern methods of contraception is rare, especially in rural areas. This study primarily compares contraceptive use among women whose abortion outcome was assessed in-clinic with women who assessed their abortion outcome at home, in a low-resource, primary health care setting. Moreover, it investigates how background characteristics and abortion service provision influences contraceptive use post-abortion. A randomized controlled, non-inferiority, trial (RCT) compared clinic follow-up with home-assessment of abortion outcome at 2 weeks post-abortion. Additionally, contraceptive-use at 3 months post-abortion was investigated through a cross-sectional follow-up interview with a largely urban sub-sample of women from the RCT. Women seeking abortion with a gestational age of up to 9 weeks and who agreed to a 2-week follow-up were included (n = 731). Women with known contraindications to medical abortions, Hb < 85 mg/l and aged below 18 were excluded. Data were collected between April 2013 and August 2014 in six primary health-care clinics in Rajasthan. A computerised random number generator created the randomisation sequence (1:1) in blocks of six. Contraceptive use was measured at 2 weeks among women successfully followed-up (n = 623) and 3 months in the sub-set of women who were included if they were recruited at one of the urban study sites, owned a phone and agreed to a 3-month follow-up (n = 114). There were no differences between contraceptive use and continuation between study groups at 3 months (76 % clinic follow-up, 77 % home-assessment), however women in the clinic follow-up group were most likely to adopt a contraceptive method at 2 weeks (62 ± 12 %), while women in the home-assessment group were most likely to adopt a method after next menstruation (60 ± 13 %). Fifty-two per cent of women who initiated a method at 2 weeks chose the 3-month injection or the copper intrauterine device. Only 4 % of women preferred sterilization. Caste, educational attainment, or type of residence did not influence contraceptive use. Simplified follow-up after early medical abortion will not change women's opportunities to access contraception in a low-resource setting, if contraceptive services are provided as intra-abortion services as early as on day one. Women's postabortion contraceptive use at 3 months is unlikely to be affected by mode of followup after medical abortion, also in a low-resource setting. Clinical guidelines need to encourage intra-abortion contraception, offering the full spectrum of evidence-based methods, especially long-acting reversible methods.

Comparison of luteal support protocols in fresh IVF/ICSI cycles: a network meta-analysis.,"Despite the proven superiority of various luteal phase support protocols (LPS) over placebo in view of improved pregnancy rates in fresh cycles of IVF (in vitro fertilization) and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) cycles, there is ongoing controversy over specific LPS protocol selection, dosage, and duration. The aim of the present study was to identify the optimal LPS under six core aspects of ART success, clinical pregnancy, live birth as primary outcomes and biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) events as secondary outcomes. Twelve databases, namely Embase (OVID), MEDLINE (R) (OVID), GlobalHealth (Archive), GlobalHealth, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Maternity & Infant Care Database (MIDIRS), APA PsycTests, ClinicalTrials.gov, HMIC Health Management Information Consortium, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus and two prospective registers, MedRxiv, Research Square were searched from inception to Aug.1st, 2023, (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42022358986). Only Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included. Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) model was employed for outcome analysis, presenting fixed effects, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). Vaginal Progesterone (VP) was considered the reference LPS given its' clinical relevance. Seventy-six RCTs, comparing 22 interventions, and including 26,536 participants were included in the present NMA. Overall CiNeMa risk of bias was deemed moderate, and network inconsistency per outcome was deemed low (Multiple pregnancy χ<sup>2</sup>: 0.11, OHSS χ<sup>2</sup>: 0.26), moderate (Clinical Pregnancy: χ<sup>2</sup>: 7.02, Live birth χ<sup>2</sup>: 10.95, Biochemical pregnancy: χ<sup>2</sup>: 6.60, Miscarriage: χ<sup>2</sup>: 11.305). Combinatorial regimens, with subcutaneous GnRH-a (SCGnRH-a) on a vaginal progesterone base and oral oestrogen (OE) appeared to overall improve clinical pregnancy events; VP + OE + SCGnRH-a [OR 1.57 (95% CrI 1.11 to 2.22)], VP + SCGnRH-a [OR 1.28 (95% CrI 1.05 to 1.55)] as well as live pregnancy events, VP + OE + SCGnRH-a [OR 8.81 (95% CrI 2.35 to 39.1)], VP + SCGnRH-a [OR 1.76 (95% CrI 1.45 to 2.15)]. Equally, the progesterone free LPS, intramuscular human chorionic gonadotrophin, [OR 9.67 (95% CrI 2.34, 73.2)] was also found to increase live birth events, however was also associated with an increased probability of ovarian hyperstimulation, [OR 1.64 (95% CrI 0.75, 3.71)]. The combination of intramuscular and vaginal progesterone was associated with higher multiple pregnancy events, [OR 7.09 (95% CrI 2.49, 31.)]. Of all LPS protocols, VP + SC GnRH-a was found to significantly reduce miscarriage events, OR 0.54 (95% CrI 0.37 to 0.80). Subgroup analysis according to ovarian stimulation (OS) protocol revealed that the optimal LPS across both long and short OS, taking into account increase in live birth and reduction in miscarriage as well as OHSS events, was VP + SCGnRH-a, with an OR 2.89 [95% CrI 1.08, 2.96] and OR 2.84 [95% CrI 1.35, 6.26] respectively. Overall, NMA data suggest that combinatorial treatments, with the addition of SCGnRH-a on a VP base result in improved clinical pregnancy and live birth events in both GnRH-agonist and antagonist ovarian stimulation protocols.",['Kastora SL; Gkova G; Stavridis K; Balachandren N; Kastoras A; Karakatsanis A; Mavrelos D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914570,"luteal phase support protocols (LPS) were superior to placebo. there is ongoing controversy over specific LPS protocol selection, dosage, and duration. a network meta-analysis was employed for outcome analysis."
Effect of circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on physical performance in women: a systematic review.,"The literature has extensively investigated potential factors influencing women's performance, including the menstrual cycle and the circadian rhythm. However, review articles exploring the combined influence of both factors remain lacking in the literature. The study aimed to systematically review the literature on the relationship between the circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on physical performance in women. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The search was performed on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar databases. Of the 1205 records identified, four articles met the inclusion criteria. From four articles, two studies found a significant interaction between the time of day and phase of the menstrual cycle with physical performance. The isometric strength increased in the afternoon in the mid-luteal phase (<i>versus</i> the morning in the mid-luteal phase, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and the maximum cycling power was higher in the afternoon in the mid-follicular phase (<i>versus</i> the morning in the mid-follicular phase, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Our findings suggest that the time of day and the menstrual cycle phase affect physical performance, with the daytime potentially having a more significant influence. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited studies and diverse methodologies used to monitor the menstrual cycle phase. This review reinforces the need for further investigation to understand better the combined effects of the circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on women's physical performance. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=380965, identifier CRD42022380965.",['Beníčková M; Gimunová M; Paludo AC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38720785,review articles exploring the combined influence of both factors remain lacking in the literature. review articles exploring the relationship between circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on physical performance in women.
"Effects of increasing the availability of vegetarian options on main meal choices, meal offer satisfaction and liking: a pre-post analysis in a French university cafeteria.","Changing the food environment is an important public health lever for encouraging sustainable food choices. Targeting the availability of vegetarian main meals served in cafeterias substantially affects food choice, but acceptability has never been assessed. We examined the effects of an availability intervention at a French university cafeteria on students' main meal choices, meal offer satisfaction and liking. A four-week controlled trial was conducted in a university cafeteria in Dijon, France. During the two-week control period, vegetarian main meals constituted 24% of the offer. In the subsequent two-week intervention period, this proportion increased to 48%, while all the other menu items remained unchanged. Students were not informed of the change. Student choices were tracked using production data, and daily paper ballots were used to assess student satisfaction with the meal offer and liking of the main meal they chose (score range [1;5]). Nutritional quality, environmental impact, and cost of production of meal choices were calculated for each lunchtime. Food waste was measured over 4 lunchtimes during control and intervention periods. An online questionnaire collected student feedback at the end of the study. Doubling availability of vegetarian main meals significantly increased the likelihood of choosing vegetarian options (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = [2.41; 2.74]). Responses of the paper ballots (n = 18,342) indicated slight improvements in meal offer satisfaction from 4.05 ± 0.92 to 4.07 ± 0.93 (p = 0.028) and in liking from 4.09 ± 0.90 to 4.13 ± 0.92 (p < 0.001) during control and intervention periods, respectively. The end-of-study questionnaire (n = 510) revealed that only 6% of students noticed a change the availability of vegetarian main meals. The intervention led to a decrease in the environmental impact of the main meals chosen, a slight decrease in nutritional quality, a slight increase in meal costs and no change in food waste. Doubling availability of vegetarian main meals in a university cafeteria resulted in a twofold increase in their selection, with students reporting being more satisfied and liking the main meals more during the intervention period. These results suggest that serving an equal proportion of vegetarian and nonvegetarian main meals could be considered in French university cafeterias to tackle environmental issues. Study protocol and analysis plan were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/pf3x7/ ).",['Arrazat L; Cambriels C; Noan CL; Nicklaus S; Marty L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39010118,"a four-week controlled trial was conducted in a university cafeteria in Dijon, france. vegetarian main meals constituted 24% of the offer. a proportion of vegetarian main meals increased to 48%."
Pursuit and escape drive fine-scale movement variation during migration in a temperate alpine ungulate.,"Climate change reduces snowpack, advances snowmelt phenology, drives summer warming, alters growing season precipitation regimes, and consequently modifies vegetation phenology in mountain systems. Elevational migrants track spatial variation in seasonal plant growth by moving between ranges at different elevations during spring, so climate-driven vegetation change may disrupt historic benefits of migration. Elevational migrants can furthermore cope with short-term environmental variability by undertaking brief vertical movements to refugia when sudden adverse conditions arise. We uncover drivers of fine-scale vertical movement variation during upland migration in an endangered alpine specialist, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) using a 20-year study of GPS collar data collected from 311 unique individuals. We used integrated step-selection analysis to determine factors that promote vertical movements and drive selection of destinations following vertical movements. Our results reveal that relatively high temperatures consistently drive uphill movements, while precipitation likely drives downhill movements. Furthermore, bighorn select destinations at their peak annual biomass and maximal time since snowmelt. These results indicate that although Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep seek out foraging opportunities related to landscape phenology, they compensate for short-term environmental stressors by undertaking brief up- and downslope vertical movements. Migrants may therefore be impacted by future warming and increased storm frequency or intensity, with shifts in annual migration timing, and fine-scale vertical movement responses to environmental variability.",['John C; Avgar T; Rittger K; Smith JA; Stephenson LW; Stephenson TR; Post E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38956435,"climate change reduces snowpack, advances snowmelt phenology, alters growing season precipitation regimes. emigration can disrupt historic benefits of migration by undertaking brief vertical movements to refugia when sudden adverse conditions arise."
New Insights in Pathogenesis of Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a gynecological disease characterized by the growth of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. The incidence of the disease is very high, there are currently no reliable early diagnostic tests, the therapies are only symptomatic and, consequently, the social impact of endometriosis is very important, also considering the related fertility problems. Despite this, the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still not fully defined. Retrograde menstruation and coelomic metaplasia are currently the most recognized pathogenetic hypotheses. Recent experimental evidences generated by our research group and by others have indicated an alteration of the fine-tuning of the female genital system developmental program during a critical window of time in the fetal life as the pathogenetic event prompting to the development of endometriosis later in life. Goal of this article is to present a revision of the recent literature about the different pathogenetic mechanisms proposed for endometriosis with particular emphasis on the embryologic theory. The possible clinical and pathological implications of these findings will be discussed.",['Signorile PG; Viceconte R; Baldi A'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35572957,"endometriosis is a gynecological disease characterized by the growth of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. the incidence of the disease is very high, there are currently no reliable early diagnostic tests, the therapies are only symptomatic and the social impact of endometriosis is very important. retrograde menstruation and coelomic metaplasia are currently the most recognized pathogenetic hypotheses."
Emotional Fertility Intention and its correlates in Ethiopia among married contraceptive user women: using linked community and health facility data from performance monitoring for action; a generalized ordered logistics regression modeling.,"Emotional fertility intention and couples communication are key during pregnancy and childbirth with simultaneous minimization of reproductive coercion. Intention to conceive is an integral part of the reproductive health (RH) right and can be considered as decision making on fertility, family wellbeing and the country's population demographic dividend and composition. However, in low and middle income countries including Ethiopia where males dominance is culturally constructed and socially accepted, males took the lead in every decision making process. In the aforementioned context, women are less likely for their voices to be heard, hence, this study aimed at determining the level of womens´ emotional fertility readiness and its correlates. The finding provided actionable evidence for the ministry and developmental partners working on reproductive and womens´ health so as to be used as an action point to empower women in terms of their reproductive health right to have control over their fertility. Linked community and facility data with nationally representation from Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA Ethiopia) 2020 Survey Ethiopia except Tigray Region were used for this study. A total of 2,069 current and/or recent contraceptive user women of child bearing age who are currently married/living together as a partner were included in this analysis. Frequency was computed to describe the study participant's characteristics. Generalized Ordered logistics regression modeling was employed to identify correlates of the hierarchical variation in women fertility intention if they became pregnant. Results were presented in the form of percentages and odds ratio with 95% Confidence Intervals. Candidate variables were selected using p-value of 0.25. Statistical significance was declared at p-value of 0.05. The proportion of womens´ emotional fertility intention of feeling unhappiness was 48.73% (95%CI: 46.21%, 51.23%). On the contrary, 22.88%, 11.36% and 17.03% of them reported that they felt sort of happy, very happy and mixed feeling. An increase in age,10 and above years marriage duration, the type of decision maker for contraceptive use were found to increase the odds of women emotional fertility intention across the higher level categories by (AOR: 95% CI: 6.75 (3.11, 14.62) times higher among elder women aged 35 to 49 years, (AOR: 95% CI: 3.79 (1.72, 8.31) times higher for women with a 10 or more years of marriage duration; and 1.83 (1.03,3.24) times higher for women whose contraceptive use was decided by the health care provide alone. A higher birth order lowered the cumulative odds of womens´ emotional fertility intention symmetrically across the higher level categories by 86% (AOR: 95% CI: 0.14 (0.07, 0.29). Women who wanted to have additional child and whose nearest facility provided 5 or more methods had an increased odds of being in the higher level categories of women emotional fertility intention with disproportional association across the cumulative logit. Accordingly, women whose nearest health facility provided 5 or more methods had an 49% (AOR: 95%CI:1.49 (1.01, 2.19) increased likelihood of being in the mixed or happy category than being very/sort of unhappy category of the emotional fertility intention while the number of methods had no significant association with emotional fertility intention at higher cumulative logit: 1.34 (0.87,2.10). Those who wanted to have an additional child had a 3.16 (2.28, 4.36) higher odds to be in the mixed or happy category than being in unhappy category. Further, this tendency was even stronger at higher categories of emotional fertility intention: 4.83 (3.23, 7.23). Nearly one in two women reported being unhappy while 17.03% felt mixed emotion calling up on intended and spaced pregnancies by ensuring women reproductive and economic empowerment to empower women to have control over their fertility. Activities and efforts that promote intended and spaced pregnancies; and diversifying access to contraceptive methods in the nearest health facilities are likely to improve women emotional fertility intention; and activities that enable women to decide their contraceptive as well. The finding that health care provider decides on women current/recent contraceptive use calls for activities to improve quality of contraceptive use counseling to enable women to decide their contraceptive use by the themselves while the access of diversified methods in the nearby health facility create an opportunity for women to obtain the method they preferred to use and make them emotionally well. These activities are hoped to enable women to plan their fertility thereby increasing their emotional well-being. These activities and interventions need to be tailored across regions and need to be age sensitive.",['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080566,"a generalized ordered logistic regression modeling was employed to identify correlates of the hierarchical variation in women fertility intention. in low and middle income countries including Ethiopia where males dominance is culturally constructed and socially accepted, males took the lead in every decision making process."
Minimal influence of the menstrual cycle or hormonal contraceptives on performance in female rugby league athletes.,"We examined performance across one menstrual cycle (MC) and 3 weeks of hormonal contraceptives (HC) use to identify whether known fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone/progestin are associated with functional performance changes. National Rugby League Indigenous Women's Academy athletes [n = 11 naturally menstruating (NM), n = 13 using HC] completed performance tests [countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), isometric mid-thigh pull, 20 m sprint, power pass and Stroop test] during three phases of a MC or three weeks of HC usage, confirmed through ovulation tests alongside serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations. MC phase or HC use did not influence jump height, peak force, sprint time, distance thrown or Stroop effect. However, there were small variations in kinetic and kinematic CMJ/SJ outputs. NM athletes produced greater mean concentric power in MC phase four than one [+0.41 W·kg<sup>-1</sup> (+16.8%), p = 0.021] during the CMJ, alongside greater impulse at 50 ms at phase one than four [+1.7 N·s (+4.7%), p = 0.031] during the SJ, without differences between tests for HC users. Among NM athletes, estradiol negatively correlated with mean velocity and power (r = -0.44 to -0.50, p < 0.047), progesterone positively correlated with contraction time (r = 0.45, p = 0.045), and both negatively correlated with the rate of force development and impulse (r = -0.45 to -0.64, p < 0.043) during the SJ. During the CMJ, estradiol positively correlated to 200 ms impulse (r = 0.45, p = 0.049) and progesterone to mean power (r = 0.51, p = 0.021). Evidence of changes in testing performance across a MC, or during active HC use, is insufficient to justify ""phase-based testing""; however, kinetic or kinematic outputs may be altered in NM athletes.",['Smith ES; Weakley J; McKay AKA; McCormick R; Tee N; Kuikman MA; Harris R; Minahan C; Buxton S; Skinner J; Ackerman KE; Elliott-Sale KJ; Stellingwerff T; Burke LM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38877892,"MC and 3 weeks of hormonal contraceptives (HC) use were examined.

Introducing comprehensive sexuality education in Italian schools: from the co-construction to the evaluation of a pilot intervention.,"School-based comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is a powerful tool that provides young people with information on all aspects of sexuality and is aimed at protecting their sexual and reproductive health and well-being throughout their lives. Currently, CSE is not integrated within the schools' curriculum in Italy. This study describes the co-construction, implementation, and evaluation of a CSE project piloted among students attending lower secondary schools, in four regions of Italy. Evidence-based evaluation will be helpful in promote the inclusion of CSE programs in the Italian schools' curriculum. The pilot scheme was co-constructed by a multidisciplinary curriculum development group through a Delphi process, including educators who conducted the activities. The evaluation followed three directions: the program (based on a literature review of CSE principles and recommended characteristics), implementation (assessing the execution of the program through the analysis of the reflection tools used by the educators), and short-term outcomes (assessing critical thinking and conscious behavioural choices through pre-post and satisfaction surveys). The main goal, learning modules and content were defined and structured in five interventions with the students, and two with families and teachers. A total of 638 students were involved in the activity, across 11 schools. Data analysis of pre/post surveys reported a significant increase in knowledge in 12 of the 15 items investigated (p < 0.05), and a high level of satisfaction with the topics addressed. Qualitative analysis added information on the pivotal role of educators in CSE. The national piloting of this educational activity provided positive insights regarding the co-construction, implementation and short-outcome evaluation, suggesting potential for scalability and future inclusion of CSE in the curricula of Italian schools.",['Chinelli A; Ubbiali M; Paparatto G; Torri E; Musco A; Galipò R; Meli P; Bellini S; Catucci N; Colaprico L; Camposeragna A; Farinella M; Rancilio L; Landi N; Stettini P; Salfa MC; Cellini A; Suligoi B; Palamara AT; Mortari L; Caraglia A; Martinelli D; Tavoschi L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39095763,a pilot scheme was co-constructed by a multidisciplinary curriculum development group. the pilot scheme was co-constructed by a multidisciplinary curriculum development group. the pilot scheme was co-constructed by a multidisciplinary curriculum development group.
Ectopic pregnancy as contraceptive failure in patient with epilepsy.,"Epilepsy is a common neurologic condition which includes many women's health issues. Menstrual disorders, reproductive endocrinological disturbances, ovulatory dysfunction and infertility appear to be relatively frequent in women with epilepsy. Clinical decision making which contraceptive regimen is optimal for an individual woman with epilepsy is one of the most challenging tasks when taking care of women with epilepsy. A higher incidence of breakthrough bleeding and contraceptive failure was determined among women using antiepileptic drugs. There is the increased risk for contraceptive failure with the use of P450 3A4 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, felbamate, topiramate and oxcarbazepine. Therefore, it is recommended to use noninducing AEDs, or for those who use inducing AEDs, the use of oral hormonal contraceptive pills which contained equal or more than 50 microg of estrogen, or intrauterine devices. The aim of the article is to present woman with epilepsy who was used combined low dose oral contraceptive pills containing 20 microg of ethinyl estradiol which in interaction with carbamazepine resulted with ectopic tubar pregnancy.",['Radaković B; Goldstajn MS'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23390854,"epilepsy is a common neurologic condition which includes many women's health issues. menstrual disorders, reproductive endocrinological disturbances, ovulatory dysfunction and infertility appear to be relatively frequent in women with epilepsy."
"Piloting a low-cost hardware intervention to reduce improper disposal of solid waste in communal toilets in low-income settlements in Dhaka, Bangladesh.","Bangladesh faces daunting challenges in addressing the sanitation needs of its urban poor. Maintaining the cleanliness and functionality of communal toilets is dependent upon periodic emptying of fecal sludge, and cooperation between users of communal toilets. Trash disposal into latrines can block the outflow pipes, rendering the toilets non-functional. Pre-intervention: We conducted in-depth interviews with five operators of fecal sludge emptying equipment and five adult residents who were also caregivers of children. We identified factors contributing to improper disposal of trash into communal toilets, a barrier to operation of the equipment, in low-income communities of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Intervention design: We developed behavior change communication materials to discourage waste disposal in toilets, and promote use of waste bins. We conducted six focus group discussions with adult male, female, landlord and children to select the preferred design for waste bins to be placed inside toilets, and finalize communication materials. Post-intervention: We then pilot-tested an intervention package to promote appropriate trash disposal practices and thus facilitate periodic removal of fecal sludge when the latrine pits become full. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions with community residents, landlords and cleaners of communal toilets. Barriers to appropriate waste disposal included lack of private location for disposal of menstrual hygiene products, limited options for formal trash collection and disposal, and the use of plastic bags for disposing children's feces. A pilot intervention including behavior change communication and trash bins was implemented in two urban slum communities. Spot checks confirmed that the bins were in place and used. Respondents described positive improvements in the appearance of the toilet and surrounding environment. The current practice on the part of local residents of disposing of waste into toilets impedes the safe removal of fecal sludge and impairs toilet functionality. Residents reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and usability resulting from this intervention, and this both improves the user experience with toilets, and also promotes the sustainability of the entrepreneurial model of Vacutug operators supported by WSUP.",['Yeasmin F; Luby SP; Saxton RE; Nizame FA; Alam MU; Dutta NC; Masud AA; Yeasmin D; Layden A; Rahman H; Abbott R; Unicomb L; Winch PJ'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28851334,"piloting low-cost hardware intervention to reduce improper disposal of solid waste in communal toilets in low-income communities in dhaka, Bangladesh. fecal sludge disposal into latrines can block outflow pipes, rendering toilets non-functional."
Influence of Menstrual Cycle and Oral Contraceptive Phases on Bone (re)modelling Markers in Response to Interval Running.,"To explore how sex hormone fluctuations may affect bone metabolism, this study aimed to examine P1NP and β-CTX-1 concentrations across the menstrual and oral contraceptive (OC) cycle phases in response to running. 17β-oestradiol, progesterone, P1NP and β-CTX-1 were analysed pre- and post-exercise in eight eumenorrheic females in the early-follicular, late-follicular, and mid-luteal phases, while 8 OC users were evaluated during the withdrawal and active pill-taking phases. The running protocol consisted of 8 × 3min treadmill runs at 85% of maximal aerobic speed. 17β-oestradiol concentrations (pg·ml<sup>-1</sup>) were lower in early-follicular (47.22 ± 39.75) compared to late-follicular (304.95 ± 235.85;p =  < 0.001) and mid-luteal phase (165.56 ± 80.6;p = 0.003) and higher in withdrawal (46.51 ± 44.09) compared to active pill-taking phase (10.88 ± 11.24;p < 0.001). Progesterone (ng·ml<sup>-1</sup>) was higher in mid-luteal (13.214 ± 4.926) compared to early-follicular (0.521 ± 0.365; p < 0.001) and late-follicular phase (1.677 ± 2.586;p < 0.001). In eumenorrheic females, P1NP concentrations (ng·ml<sup>-1</sup>) were higher in late-follicular (69.97 ± 17.84) compared to early-follicular (60.96 ± 16.64;p = 0.006;) and mid-luteal phase (59.122 ± 11.77;p = 0.002). β-CTX-1 concentrations (ng·ml<sup>-1</sup>) were lower in mid-luteal (0.376 ± 0.098) compared to late-follicular (0.496 ± 0.166; p = 0.001) and early-follicular phase (0.452 ± 0.148; p = 0.039). OC users showed higher post-exercise P1NP concentrations in withdrawal phase (61.75 ± 8.32) compared to post-exercise in active pill-taking phase (45.45 ± 6;p < 0.001). Comparing hormonal profiles, post-exercise P1NP concentrations were higher in early-follicular (66.91 ± 16.26;p < 0.001), late-follicular (80.66 ± 16.35;p < 0.001) and mid-luteal phases (64.57 ± 9.68;p = 0.002) to active pill-taking phase. These findings underscore the importance of studying exercising females with different ovarian hormone profiles, as changes in sex hormone concentrations affect bone metabolism in response to running, showing a higher post-exercise P1NP concentrations in all menstrual cycle phases compared with active pill-taking phase of the OC cycle.",['Guisado-Cuadrado I; Romero-Parra N; Elliott-Sale KJ; Sale C; Díaz ÁE; Peinado AB'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066926,"17-oestradiol, progesterone, P1NP and -CTX-1 were analysed in eight eumenorrheic females in the early-follicular, late-follicular, and mid-luteal phases. 8 OC users were evaluated during the withdrawal and active pill-taking phases."
The potential role of the orexin system in premenstrual syndrome.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) occurs recurrently during the luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle and disappears after menstruation ends. It is characterized by abnormal changes in both the body and mood, and in certain cases, severe disruptions in daily life and even suicidal tendencies. Current drugs for treating PMS, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, do not yield satisfactory results. Orexin, a neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus, is garnering attention in the treatment of neurological disorders and is believed to modulate the symptoms of PMS. This paper reviews the advancements in research on sleep disturbances, mood changes, and cognitive impairment caused by PMS, and suggests potential pathways for orexin to address these symptoms. Furthermore, it delves into the role of orexin in the molecular mechanisms underlying PMS. Orexin regulates steroid hormones, and the cyclic fluctuations of estrogen and progesterone play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PMS. Additionally, orexin also modulates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and the inflammatory response involved in coordinating the mechanism of PMS. Unraveling the role of orexin in the pathogenesis of PMS will not only aid in understanding the etiology of PMS but also hold implications for orexin as a novel target for treating PMS.",['Dong P; Dai W; Su M; Wang S; Ma Y; Zhao T; Zheng F; Sun P'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38292774,"premenstrual syndrome (PMS) occurs recurrently during the luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle. it disappears after menstruation ends and is characterized by abnormal changes in both the body and mood. current drugs for treating PMS, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, do not yield satisfactory results."
Prospective non-randomized comparison of transurethral laser en bloc resection vs. conventional resection of bladder tumors larger than 3 cm.,"En bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) is an established surgical treatment method for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in tumors less than 3 cm. Data regarding the efficacy and safety of ERBT on larger than 3 cm tumors are sparse and its efficacy compared to conventional transurethral resection (TURBT) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the feasibility, safety and oncological outcomes of laser (Tm-fiber) ERBT and TURBT in patients with primary bladder lesions ≥3 cm. A cohort of 45 patients who underwent surgery for primary NMIBC between February 2018 and March 2022 was collected prospectively. There was no randomization. All procedures were performed by two experienced surgeons. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age >18 years, primary Ta or T1 bladder tumor with a diameter of ≥3 cm, no more than 3 tumors and no history of upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Exclusion criteria were carcinoma in situ or invasion into muscle layer (≥T2). ERBT was performed with thulium fiber laser (IPG, Russia). Primary endpoints included efficacy with recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 3, 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints were safety parameters, perioperative data and specimen quality (the presence of muscle layer in specimens). Twenty-eight patients underwent laser ERBT and 17 conventional TURBT. The location and size of the tumors were comparable in both groups. The success rate was 93.3% in the ERBT group with two cases of conversion from ERBT to TURBT. Detrusor muscle was present in 92.8% patients in the ERBT group versus 70.5% in the TURBT group (P=0.04). Obturator nerve reflex was observed only in the TURBT group: 17.6% vs. 0.0% (P=0.02). The frequency of other complications was comparable between the two groups. RFS was not statistically different between the two methods at 3 (93.9% vs. 94.1%, P=0.87), 6 (89.3% vs. 82.3%, P=0.5) and 12 months (89.3% vs. 70.6%, P=0.11). Laser ERBT is a feasible and safe procedure to manage bladder tumors larger than 3 cm. While it seems safer than TURBT, its effect on efficacy remains to be assessed in larger trials.",['Petov V; Timofeeva E; Sukhanov R; Baniel J; Mustafin M; Fajkovic H; Morozov A; Teoh JY; Singla N; Laukhtina E; Herrmann TR; Shariat SF; Enikeev D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39051891,ERBT is an established surgical treatment method for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in tumors less than 3 cm. results are sparse and its efficacy compared to conventional resection remains unclear.

The Impact of Irregular Menstruation on Health: A Review of the Literature.,"Women are considered to have an irregular menstrual cycle if their cycle length is less than 21 days or more than 35 days, accompanied by less or very severe blood flow. The prevalence of menstrual cycle irregularities varies across countries. Irregular periods can occur due to changes in the body's levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones, which disrupt the normal pattern of the period. Menstrual irregularity has been found to be associated with various diseases and medical conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Anemia, osteoporosis, psychological problems, impaired quality of life, and infertility have also been recorded. Moreover, a significant correlation between irregular periods and the risk of developing pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, as well as an increased risk of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, has been proven. Therefore, irregular menstruation is considered an important health indicator among women. Physical, mental, social, psychological, and reproductive problems are often associated with menstrual irregularities. Thus, evaluating the factors associated with irregular menstruation is necessary to determine appropriate preventive and treatment strategies and to decrease the associated health problems. The aim of this review was to define normal and irregular menstruation, their types, and prevalence, to recognize the risk factors and causes of irregular menstruation, and to understand their impact on women's health.",['Attia GM; Alharbi OA; Aljohani RM'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38130524,women are considered to have an irregular menstrual cycle if their cycle length is less than 21 days or more than 35 days. the prevalence of irregular menstrual cycles varies across countries. irregular periods can occur due to changes in the body's levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones.
Prolactin Biology and Laboratory Measurement: An Update on Physiology and Current Analytical Issues.,"Prolactin is a 23 kDa single chain protein of 199 amino acids synthesised and released principally by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland. The secretion is mainly under inhibitory control by hypothalamic dopamine and regulated in a negative feedback manner, with prolactin itself providing the afferent signal: short-loop feedback. The main function of prolactin is during pregnancy and lactation in the development of mammary glands, milk synthesis and maintenance of milk secretion. Serum prolactin levels rise rapidly during pregnancy with increase in the size and number of lactotrophs. During lactation suckling induces rapid secretion of prolactin via a neuroendocrine reflex pathway. In the absence of pregnancy, hyperprolactinaemia may present with symptoms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism including menstrual disturbance and infertility or visual symptoms from a pituitary mass effect by a prolactinoma, the most common pituitary tumour. Hyperprolactinaemia is diagnosed by laboratory measurement of serum prolactin. There is considerable variability in routinely available prolactin immunoassays as a result of differing reactivity towards monomeric prolactin and macroprolactin and lack of commutability of the WHO 3<sup>rd</sup> International Standard between routine methods. Macroprolactinaemia is a relatively common cause of interference in the prolactin assay that may lead to incorrect diagnosis and unnecessary investigations. Measurement of prolactin post polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) when prolactin levels are above the reference interval is routinely used to identify macroprolactin, however harmonisation of PEG precipitation process and reporting may improve clinical care.",['Saleem M; Martin H; Coates P'],2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30072818,prolactin is a 23 kDa single chain protein of 199 amino acids. secretion is mainly under inhibitory control by hypothalamic dopamine. prolactin itself provides the afferent signal: short-loop feedback.
"Are you ready for a challenge? Personality traits influence dairy calves' responses to disease, pain, and nutritional challenges.","Dairy calves routinely experience disease, pain, and nutritional stressors such as diarrhea, dehorning, and weaning early in life. These stressors lead to changes in behavioral expression that varies in magnitude between individuals, where a greater magnitude change would suggest lower resilience in individuals to a stressor. Thus, this study first aimed to quantify the individual variation in magnitude change in feeding behaviors and activity in response to a bout of diarrhea, dehorning, and weaning. The next objective was to then investigate if personality traits were related to this magnitude of behavioral response in dairy calves, and thus their resilience toward these stressors. Calves were followed with 2 precision livestock technologies (e.g.: an automatic feeding system (AFS), and leg accelerometer) to track behavioral changes in response during the time when the stressors were present. The AFS provided daily measures of milk intake, drinking speed, rewarded and unrewarded visits to the milk feeding station, and calf starter intake. The leg accelerometer provided daily measures of steps, activity index, lying time, and lying bouts. At 23 ± 3 d of age, Holstein dairy calves (n = 49) were subjected to a series of standardized personality tests that exposed calf to novelty and fear stimuli. Factors extracted from a principal component analysis on the behaviors from the personality test were utilized to represent personality traits: Factor 1 ('Fearful'), Factor 2 ('Active') and Factor 3 ('Explorative'). The magnitude change in behaviors from the precision livestock technologies were calculated relative to the behavior performed on the day the stressor occurred (i.e., day of diagnosis; day of dehorning; day weaned). Linear regression models were utilized to determine if calf scores on each factor were associated with magnitude change in behavior for each of the stressor periods with day relative to the stressor included as a repeated measure. Models were run independently for the period leading up to and following each stressor. We found that calves varied in their behavioral responses to diarrhea, dehorning, and weaning stressors, despite being reared in the same environment and experiencing consistent management procedures. Additionally, personality traits measured from standardized tests were associated to both the direction and magnitude of change in behaviors around each stressor. For instance, with diarrhea, calves that were highly 'Fearful' had a greater magnitude change in milk intake and drinking speed following diagnosis than the least 'Fearful' calves. With dehorning, calves that were highly 'Explorative' had a greater magnitude change in lying time when dehorned, but a smaller magnitude change in lying bouts and drinking speed following dehorning, than the least 'explorative' calves. With weaning, calves that were highly 'Active' had a smaller magnitude change in unrewarded visits leading up to and following weaning than calves that were the least 'Active'. Each of the personality traits had a significant association with change in behavior surrounding each of the stressors evaluated, although these associations depended on the type of stressor. These results have implications for how individual calves experience each stressor and therefore individual animal welfare.",['Setser MMW; Neave HW; Costa JHC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39033912,"dairy calves routinely experience disease, pain, and nutritional stressors. a greater magnitude change would suggest lower resilience in individuals to a stressor. this study aimed to quantify the individual variation in magnitude change in feeding behaviors and activity in response to a bout of diarrhea, dehorning, and weaning."
Teachers' perspective on implementation of menstrual hygiene management and puberty education in a pilot study in Bangladeshi schools.,"To assess the perspectives of Bangladeshi teachers on the feasibility of delivery and potential for long-term sustainability of puberty and menstruation education in urban and rural schools. We developed a multi-module puberty and menstrual hygiene management education curriculum that teachers piloted for six months in four urban and rural government and private schools in Bangladesh. We conducted monthly assessments during piloting, discussion for manual revision and four group discussions with 20 participating teachers to understand perceived benefits, barriers, and sustainability of puberty and menstruation education among school children. Teachers acknowledged the importance of school-based puberty and menstruation education to improve students' perception and preparedness. They found that the training and instructors' manual they received were useful tools for effectively communicating with students. Teachers noted school and community pressure to de-emphasize educational content not included on nationally standardized examinations, and insufficient time and pre-service training for teaching sensitive topics served as barriers to implementing the pilot curriculum. Pressure from school authorities and community may hinder the successful long-term delivery of school-based puberty and menstruation education programs that are external to the national curriculum. Our findings indicate that feasibly and sustainably improving education on these topics in Bangladeshi classrooms should be achieved through 1) revision of the current national curriculum to incorporate more comprehensive puberty and menstruation information including its physiology, management, and social context, 2) adequate training and support for teachers to deliver the content, and 3) incorporation of puberty and menstruation content into students' national examinations which may better ensure teachers are given the tools and opportunity to prioritize teaching this content.",['Mahfuz MT; Sultana F; Hunter EC; Jahan F; Akand F; Khan S; Mobashhara M; Rahman M; Alam MU; Unicomb L; Luby SP; Winch PJ'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34338160,teachers piloted a multi-module puberty and menstruation education curriculum in four schools in Bangladesh. teachers acknowledged the importance of school-based puberty and menstruation education to improve students' perception and preparedness. teachers noted school pressure to de-emphasize educational content not included on nationally standardized examinations.
American Academy of Pediatrics. Clinical report--gynecologic examination for adolescents in the pediatric office setting.,"The American Academy of Pediatrics promotes the inclusion of the gynecologic examination in the primary care setting within the medical home. Gynecologic issues are commonly seen by clinicians who provide primary care to adolescents. Some of the most common concerns include questions related to pubertal development; menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, and abnormal uterine bleeding; contraception; and sexually transmitted and non-sexually transmitted infections. The gynecologic examination is a key element in assessing pubertal status and documenting physical findings. Most adolescents do not need an internal examination involving a speculum or bimanual examination. However, for cases in which more extensive examination is needed, the primary care office with the primary care clinician who has established rapport and trust with the patient is often the best setting for pelvic examination. This report reviews the gynecologic examination, including indications for the pelvic examination in adolescents and the approach to this examination in the office setting. Indications for referral to a gynecologist are included. The pelvic examination may be successfully completed when conducted without pressure and approached as a normal part of routine young women's health care.",['Braverman PK; Breech L'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20805151,the gynecologic examination is a key element in assessing pubertal status. most adolescents do not need an internal examination involving a speculum or bimanual examination.
Herbal preparations for uterine fibroids.,"Uterine fibroids are the most common non-malignant growths in women of childbearing age. They are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and subfertility. Herbal preparations are commonly used as alternatives to surgical procedures. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for treatment of uterine fibroids. The authors with the guidance of the Trials Search Coordinator searched the following electronic databases: the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), AMED, and LILACS. The searches were up to 11 September 2012. Randomised controlled trials comparing herbal preparations with no intervention, placebo, medical treatment, or surgical procedures in women with uterine fibroids. We included trials of herbal preparations with or without conventional therapy. Two review authors collected data independently. We assessed trial risk of bias according to our methodological criteria. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 21 randomised trials (involving 2222 women) and the majority of them had unclear or high risk of bias. There were several different herbal preparations used within the included trials. The average treatment duration was three to six months. The primary outcome of uterine fibroid related symptoms was not reported in any of the included trials. The majority of the trials reported fibroid volume and size of the uterus.Compared with mifepristone, Tripterygium wilfordii extract was associated with a greater reduction in the fibroid volume (MD -23.03 cm(3), 95% CI -28.39 to -17.67; 2 trials) and in uterine size (MD -51.25 cm(3), 95% CI -77.70 to -24.80; 2 trials). There was no evidence of a significant difference between Nona Roguy herbal product and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist on the average fibroid volume or the uterine size. The combination of Guizhi Fuling formula and mifepristone was associated with a greater reduction in the fibroid volume (-1.72 [-2.42, -1.02] 7 trials) and in uterine size (MD -31.63 [95% CI -54.58, -8.68] 3 trials)) compared with mifepristone alone. Only 13/21 trials reported on adverse events and no serious adverse effects from herbal preparations were reported. Current evidence does not support or refute the use of herbal preparations for treatment of uterine fibroids due to insufficient studies with large sample sizes and of high quality. Further high quality trials evaluating clinically relevant outcomes are warranted.",['Liu JP; Yang H; Xia Y; Cardini F'],2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23633329,uterine fibroids are the most common non-malignant growths in women of childbearing age. they are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and subfertility. herbal preparations are commonly used as alternatives to surgical procedures.
[Analysis of management efficacy in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy].,"<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate different methods' efficacy of controlling acute bleeding and managing long-term menstruation in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with antithrombotic therapy. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 22 cases with HMB associated with antithrombotic therapy admitted to Peking University People's Hospital from January 2010 to August 2022 were analyzed, aged 39 years old (26-46 years). Changes in menstrual volume, hemoglobin (Hb), and quality of life were collected after control of acute bleeding and long-term menstrual management. Menstrual volume was assessed by pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC), and quality of life was assessed by menorrhagia multi-attribute scale (MMAS). <b>Results:</b> (1) Treatment of acute bleeding: of the 22 cases with HMB associated with antithrombotic therapy, 16 cases were treated in our hospital and 6 in other hospital for emergency bleeding; of the 16 cases treated in our hospital, 3 underwent emergency intrauterine Foley catheter balloon compression due to severe bleeding (Hb decreased by 20 to 40 g/L within 12 hours). Of the 22 cases with antithrombotic therapy-related HMB, 15 (including 2 cases with severe bleeding) underwent emergency aspiration or endometrial resection, and intraoperative placement of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) followed by a significant reduction in bleeding volume; 3 cases had controlled acute bleeding after rivaroxaban dose reduction and continued observation; 2 cases were given gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to control acute bleeding in other hospital, of which 1 case was temporarily treated with periodic blood transfusion, and the other one patient underwent total hysterectomy; and 2 cases had temporary amenorrhea with oral mifepristone after intrauterine balloon compression or oral norethindrone. (2) Long-term menstrual management: of the 22 cases with antithrombotic therapy-related HMB, 15 had LNG-IUS placement and 12 had LNG-IUS placement for 6 months, and menstrual volume was significantly reduced [PBAC scores were 365.0 (272.5-460.0) vs 25.0 (12.5-37.5), respectively; <i>Z</i>=4.593, <i>P</i><0.001], Hb was significantly increased [91.5 g/L (71.8-108.2 g/L) vs 128.5 g/L (121.2-142.5 g/L); <i>Z</i>=4.695, <i>P</i><0.001], and quality of life was significantly improved [MMAS scores were 415.0 (327.5-472.5) vs 580.0 (570.0-580.0), respectively; <i>Z</i>=-3.062, <i>P</i>=0.002] before placement compared with 6 months after placement. Three rivaroxaban dose reduction patients' PBAC scores decreased by 20 to 35 but remained >100, and perceived quality of life did not change significantly. Two cases with temporary amenorrhea treated with oral mifepristone felt significantly improved quality of life, and the MMAS scores increased by 220 and 180, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Intrauterine Foley catheter balloon compression, aspiration or endometrial ablation could be used to control acute bleeding in patients with antithrombotic therapy-related HMB, and LNG-IUS for long-term management could reduce menstrual volume, increase hemoglobin, and improve the quality of life of patients.",['Jiang XL; Yan X; Su HN; Liu YH; Han RX; Song ZY; Sun XW; Su DH; Yang X'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37072297,"22 cases with HMB associated with antithrombotic therapy admitted to peking university people's hospital from January 2010 to august 2022 were analyzed. changes in menstrual volume, hemoglobin (Hb) and quality of life were collected after control of acute bleeding and long-term menstrual management."

The association of COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual health: A period-tracking app-based cohort study.,"In initial COVID-19 clinical trials, menstrual health was not formally monitored, yet anecdotal reports of menstruation changes surfaced on social media. This study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 vaccines and menstruation using Clue, a period-tracking application. A survey assessing demographics, menstrual health, stress levels, and COVID-19 vaccination was sent to Clue users between 12/7/2021 and 2/9/2022. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18 years or older (2) currently menstruating (3) not pregnant or breastfeeding since 1/2020. Menstrual data was collected for each participant. Users with cycle lengths more than 90 days were excluded. Cycle lengths were calculated for the 6-month average pre-vaccination (PRIOR), the cycle during which vaccination was administered (DURING), the cycle following DURING (AFTER1), and the cycle following AFTER1 (AFTER2). For periods, individuals were stratified based on whether vaccination was received during their menstrual period (DURING). Period lengths were additionally calculated for the 6-month average pre-vaccination (PRIOR), the first period following vaccination (AFTER1), and the period following AFTER1 (AFTER2). For unvaccinated participants, an index date (4/1/2022) was used to similarly designate menstrual cycles and periods. For each participant, cycle length changes for DURING, AFTER1, and AFTER2 compared to PRIOR were determined. Student's <i>t</i>-test compared the mean of these changes between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Of 7,559 participants, 6,897 (91 %) were vaccinated. Compared to PRIOR, individuals vaccinated during their menstrual period demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the DURING period length, but not AFTER1 (p = 0.463) and AFTER2 (p = 0.692). No statistically significant changes were observed in period lengths of those vaccinated in between periods or in cycle lengths overall.

"Eyes, menstruation and endometriosis.","Vicarious menstruation refers to cyclical bleeding outside the uterine cavity during the menstrual cycle. Haemolacria, or blood in tears, is a rare medical phenomenon that can occur with menstruation or in association with endometriosis. Endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue in extra-uterine sites, affects around 10% of fertile women; the ocular system is one of the rarest sites it can be present in. Endometriosis usually requires a biopsy for diagnosis, and the anatomic difficulty of obtaining a biopsy of the ocular system makes ocular endometriosis diagnosis more obscure. However, few cases have been described in the literature and due to the psychological, physical, and social implications of haemolacria on the patient, treatment is of utmost importance. We reviewed the literature on ocular endometriosis and ocular vicarious menstruation with the aim to discuss the clinical presentation, necessary workup and various treatment modalities, while also shedding light on the connection between the eyes and endometriosis in general. It is hypothesised that uterine endometrial cells can travel lymphatically or haematogenously and deposit extra-uterine endometriotic lesions that bleed in response to hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle. Additionally, the conjunctival vasculature has been found to be responsive to hormonal changes due to the presence of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, causing bleeding at the corresponding sites, even without endometriotic lesions. Clinical correlation of the haemolacria with the menstrual cycle can suffice for a diagnosis of vicarious menstruation, and thus opens the possibility of treatment to provide symptomatic treatment for the patient.",['Rahman S; Youssef Y; Maroun G; Inaty D; Kheil MH; Moawad G'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37436046,ocular endometriosis is a rare medical phenomenon that can occur with menstruation or in association with endometriosis. ocular endometriosis affects around 10% of fertile women. the ocular system is one of the rarest sites it can be present in.
Clinical characteristics of female long COVID patients with menstrual symptoms: a retrospective study from a Japanese outpatient clinic.,"To elucidate the impact of long COVID on menstruation and mental health, medical records of patients with long COVID were evaluated. Symptoms of long COVID, QOL, mental health, and related endocrine data were compared between two groups with and without menstrual disturbances. Of 349 female patients who visited our clinic between February 2021 and March 2023, 223 patients with long COVID (aged 18-50 years) were included. Forty-four (19.7%) of the patients had menstrual symptoms associated with long COVID. The patients with menstrual symptoms were older than those without menstrual symptoms (42.5 <i>vs.</i> 38 years). The percentage of patients with menstrual symptoms was higher during the Omicron phase (24%) than during the Preceding (13%) and Delta (12%) phases. Cycle irregularity was the most frequent (in 63.6% of the patients), followed by severe pain (25%), heavy bleeding (20.5%), perimenopausal symptoms (18.2%), and premenstrual syndrome (15.9%). Fatigue and depression were the most frequent complications. Scores for fatigue and for QOL were significantly worse in long COVID patients with menstrual symptoms. Results of endocrine examinations showed significantly increased cortisol levels in patients with menstrual complaints.

The effects of female sex hormones on the human cornea across a woman's life cycle.,"The cornea is a hormone-responsive tissue that responds to changing levels of female sex hormones. This review focuses on the structural and functional changes in the human cornea associated with the hormonal milestones of menarche, pregnancy, and menopause, as well as consequences stemming from the use of exogenous sex hormones for fertility control and replacement. Articles were identified by searching PubMed without language or region restrictions. The primary outcomes evaluated were changes in central corneal thickness (CCT), intraocular pressure (IOP), and quality of the ocular tear film. The potential impact of hormone-associated changes on the diagnosis and surgical management of common eye diseases, as well as the potential use of sex hormones as therapeutic agents is also considered.

Curative effects of two new endometrial ablation procedures using radiofrequency thermocoagulation for the treatment of severe abnormal uterine bleeding.,"Severe Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (SAUB) is a common gynecological disorder. The clinical characteristics include disordered menstrual cycle and massive bleeding that can cause anemia or secondary infection. Current treatment mainly relies on drug therapy or surgical removal of the uterus, each having its significant disadvantages. How to preserve the uterus, reduce the pain from surgery, and achieve better treatment effects have been well known but remaining as unresolved issues. This study aims at evaluating two types of radiofrequency (RF) thermocoagulation procedures for the treatment of SAUB: the RF-A procedure group included 25 SAUB patients ≥45 years of age treated for amenorrhea; the RF-B procedure group included 51 patients at <45 years of age treated for the control of excessive bleeding. Post-treatment ratings of menstrual satisfaction and pre-/post-treatment menstrual scores-pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC)-and hemoglobin levels were collected; and the mean length of follow-up was 72 months. Also, 38 SAUB patients treated with standard drug regimens served as a control group. The results of the study showed that following RF treatment, the average long-term patient menstrual satisfaction was greater than 92 %. In both the RF groups, PBAC scores and hemoglobin levels were significantly improved from baseline (p < .05). Compared with the control group, PBAC scores and hemoglobin levels were also significantly better for the RF groups at 6-24-month post-operation. Patients experienced no hysterectomy in association with the RF procedures. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that the novel RF procedures are both safe and effective in treating patients with SAUB. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate their application in broader clinical indication.",['Yin G; Li J; Zhu T; Chen M'],2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325308,RF-A procedure group included 25 patients 45 years of age treated for amenorrhea.

Vaginal microbiome differences between patients with adenomyosis with different menstrual cycles and healthy controls.,"Adenomyosis is a commonly observed benign gynecological disease that affects the quality of life and social psychology of women of childbearing age. However, because of the unknown etiology and incidence of adenomyosis, its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear; further, because no noninvasive, accurate, and individualized diagnostic methods are available, treatment and efficacy evaluations are limited. Notably, the interaction between the changes in the microecological environment of the female reproductive tract and human immunity, endocrine, and other links leads to the occurrence and development of diseases. In addition, the vaginal microbiome differs in different menstrual cycles; therefore, assessing the differences between the microbiomes of patients with adenomyosis and healthy individuals in different menstrual cycles will improve the understanding of the disease and provide references for the search for noninvasive diagnosis and individualized precision treatment of adenomyosis. This study aimed to explored the data of individuals in different menstrual cycles. Differences in the vaginal microbiome between patients with adenomyosis and healthy individuals were observed. At phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the adenomyosis group was higher than that in the control group, which contributed the most to the species difference between the two groups. At the genus level, Lactobacillus was the most dominant in both groups, Alpha-diversity analysis showed significant differences in the adenomyosis and control group during luteal phase (Shannon index, p = 0.0087; Simpson index, p = 0.0056). Beta-diversity index was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.018). However, based on Weighted Unifrac analysis, significant differences were only observed throughout the luteal phase (p = 0.0146). Within the adenomyosis group, differences between women with different menstrual cycles were also observed. Finally, 50 possible biomarkers including were screened and predicted based on the random forest analyse. The vaginal microbiome of patients with adenomyosis and healthy individuals differed during menstrual periods, especially during the luteal phase.

Preparing for Puberty in Girls With Special Needs: A Cohort Study of Caregiver Concerns and Patient Outcomes.,"To characterize the patient population with cognitive or physical impairments that presents for anticipatory guidance of puberty, evaluate caregiver concerns with respect to puberty, and describe chosen management strategies and outcomes following menarche. Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Academic tertiary care women and children's hospital PARTICIPANTS: Eligible female patients with special needs up to age 26 years presenting for anticipatory guidance from 2009 to 2018 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included characterization of patients presenting for anticipatory guidance and their reasons for menstrual management. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with menstrual management and bleeding patterns. A total of 61 patients presented for anticipatory guidance of puberty, on average 13.5 months prior to menarche. Compared to the overall adolescent population with special needs who presented for gynecologic care, patients who had autism spectrum disorder (ASD), were nonverbal, or had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) were more likely to present for a pre-menarchal visit to discuss anticipated pubertal development (P < .001, P = .009, and P = .04, respectively). More than half of families described potential behavioral changes as their main concern. The majority of post-menarchal patients (80%) desired hormonal management of menses, including 30% of patients who had placement of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device. In all, 96% of patients were satisfied with their final menstrual bleeding pattern; 50% achieved amenorrhea or light spotting. This study describes the important role of pre-menarchal reproductive counseling for girls with disabilities. Anticipation of puberty causes great anxiety in families and patients, especially those with ASD, ADD/ADHD, and non-verbal status. Providers should consider initiating these conversations early in pubertal development.",['Fei YF; Ernst SD; Dendrinos ML; Quint EH'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33838332,"61 patients presented for anticipatory guidance of puberty, on average 13.5 months prior to menarche. a total of 61 patients presented for anticipatory guidance of puberty, on average 13.5 months prior to menarche. more than half of families described potential behavioral changes as their main concern."
"Assessing the Pregnancy Protective Impact of Scheduled Nonadherence to a Novel Progestin-Only Pill: Protocol for a Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Crossover Study.","Progestin-only contraceptive pills (POP) are commonly reserved for women with medical comorbidities but in actuality, POPs can be safely used by anyone wanting to prevent pregnancy. This wide safety profile makes them an ideal candidate for being available over the counter without a prescription, but adherence issues may be more common with over-the-counter use. We need a better understanding of the ability of POPs to prevent pregnancy when adherence issues occur in the form of a missed or delayed pill. This study aims to determine cervical mucus characteristics following a 6-hour delayed pill intake or after one missed pill as compared to typical daily use of norgestrel 75 mcg. This prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover study assesses the effect of norgestrel 75 mcg (Opill) on cervical mucus and ovarian activity during reported compliant daily use, after a 6-hour delayed intake mid cycle, and after a mid-cycle missed pill. Subject participation will last approximately 4.5 months. We will recruit at 2 US sites: Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon and University of California Davis Health, Sacramento, California. Reproductive-aged subjects with regular menstrual cycles (21-35 days), BMI <32 kg/m2, and proven ovulation (screening luteal phase progesterone >3 ng/mL [>10 nmol/L]) are eligible to enroll. Participants cannot be at risk for pregnancy during the study period and not use other hormonal methods. Norgestrel 75 mcg will be taken at the same time daily except for one day in each of treatment periods 2 and 3, when the pill will be taken either 6 hours late (delayed pill) or omitted completely (missed pill). Every 3-4 days, we will monitor subjects for follicular activity with transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) examination, cervical mucus, and blood sampling for ovarian hormones and gonadotropins. Subjects will undergo serial cervical mucus sampling on the days with missed and delayed pill intake at 8 hours after pill intake on the day before the delayed or missed pill, 3 hours following the scheduled time of pill intake if intake was delayed, 6 hours after the scheduled time if intake was omitted, and on the next day 30 minutes before the time of scheduled pill intake. The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of a delayed or omitted pill intake on cervical mucus characteristics based on a modified Insler score compared to reported daily use.

Dynamic home range of the grey-sided vole Craseomys rufocanus: a pilot study.,"Knowledge about home range size is vital to understand social systems and population dynamics of small mammals, as well as dispersal and a species' landscape use. Home ranges have been mapped for some species of voles (subfamily Microtinae) but remain virtually unknown for many species, including the grey-sided vole Craseomys rufocanus. A small pilot study was carried out in an inland valley of northern Norway, where six adult C. rufocanus were radio-tracked with one male and one female in each of the summers 2021-2023. Despite the small sample size, a large variation in home range size was found; males 2 294 - 36 887 m<sup>2</sup> and females 1 728-7 392 m<sup>2</sup> (100% MCP). Three of the voles tracked over a prolonged period of time showed a dynamic use and shifting of the range. Home range size and use was mostly related to reproduction. The male with the smallest range had probably not yet become reproductively active, whereas the male with the largest range was searching for females at a time when vole density was very low. The third male reduced his range when the reproductive season ended. For females the most important limitations were food, shelter and dependent young, those with young needed to return frequently and spend more time at the nest site. When the reproductive season ended, one female increased her range, perhaps exploring sites to overwinter. Home range use in this population appears to be more dynamic than has previously been reported for C. rufocanus. The large ranges of males most likely resulted from the search of reproductively active females, outside of the reproductive season male ranges approximated female ranges. Female ranges most likely were limited by the need to feed close to their nest with dependent young, being able to roam more freely when reproduction ended.",['Frafjord K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39010127,a pilot study was carried out in an inland valley of northern Norway. six adult voles were radio-tracked with one male and one female. the male with the smallest range had probably not yet become reproductively active.
Subcutaneous etonogestrel implant combined with endometrial ablation for the treatment of adenomyosis: two case reports.,"Adenomyosis is a common disease that affects many premenopausal women. Two patients with adenomyosis, aged 51 and 42 years, presented with dysmenorrhea and increased menstrual volume. They refused laparoscopy or laparotomy surgery and were not eligible for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). The first patient underwent endometrial ablation and subcutaneous etonogestrel (ENG)-releasing implant placement at the same time. Her symptoms of dysmenorrhea and heavy menstruation improved significantly. When serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) levels suggested menopause, the ENG-releasing implant was removed. However, her abdominal pain recurred and was relieved by medication. For the second patient, an ENG-releasing implant was placed first, and her dysmenorrhea and heavy menstrual volume were relieved. However, the bleeding pattern changed from regular bleeding to prolonged bleeding, which troubled the patient. Endometrial ablation was performed 4 months later to solve the problem. Both patients had improved symptoms and were satisfied with the treatment. For patients with adenomyosis who refuse surgery and are not candidates for the use of LNG-IUS, an ENG-releasing implant combined with endometrial ablation may be an effective alternative.",['Nie LK; Zou HL; Cheng L; Zhang PH'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713941,"two patients with adenomyosis, aged 51 and 42 years, presented with dysmenorrhea and increased menstrual volume. they refused laparoscopy or laparotomy surgery and were not eligible for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) the first patient underwent endometrial ablation and subcutaneous etonogestrel (ENG)-releasing implant placement at the same time."
International society of sports nutrition position stand: nutritional concerns of the female athlete.,"Based on a comprehensive review and critical analysis of the literature regarding the nutritional concerns of female athletes, conducted by experts in the field and selected members of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), the following conclusions represent the official Position of the Society: 1. Female athletes have unique and unpredictable hormone profiles, which influence their physiology and nutritional needs across their lifespan. To understand how perturbations in these hormones affect the individual, we recommend that female athletes of reproductive age should track their hormonal status (natural, hormone driven) against training and recovery to determine their individual patterns and needs and peri and post-menopausal athletes should track against training and recovery metrics to determine the individuals' unique patterns. 2. The primary nutritional consideration for all athletes, and in particular, female athletes, should be achieving adequate energy intake to meet their energy requirements and to achieve an optimal energy availability (EA); with a focus on the timing of meals in relation to exercise to improve training adaptations, performance, and athlete health. 3. Significant sex differences and sex hormone influences on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are apparent, therefore we recommend first ensuring athletes meet their carbohydrate needs across all phases of the menstrual cycle. Secondly, tailoring carbohydrate intake to hormonal status with an emphasis on greater carbohydrate intake and availability during the active pill weeks of oral contraceptive users and during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle where there is a greater effect of sex hormone suppression on gluconogenesis output during exercise. 4. Based upon the limited research available, we recommend that pre-menopausal, eumenorrheic, and oral contraceptives using female athletes should aim to consume a source of high-quality protein as close to beginning and/or after completion of exercise as possible to reduce exercise-induced amino acid oxidative losses and initiate muscle protein remodeling and repair at a dose of 0.32-0.38 g·kg<sup>-1</sup>. For eumenorrheic women, ingestion during the luteal phase should aim for the upper end of the range due to the catabolic actions of progesterone and greater need for amino acids. 5. Close to the beginning and/or after completion of exercise, peri- and post-menopausal athletes should aim for a bolus of high EAA-containing (~10 g) intact protein sources or supplements to overcome anabolic resistance. 6. Daily protein intake should fall within the mid- to upper ranges of current sport nutrition guidelines (1.4-2.2 g·kg<sup>-1</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup>) for women at all stages of menstrual function (pre-, peri-, post-menopausal, and contraceptive users) with protein doses evenly distributed, every 3-4 h, across the day. Eumenorrheic athletes in the luteal phase and peri/post-menopausal athletes, regardless of sport, should aim for the upper end of the range. 7. Female sex hormones affect fluid dynamics and electrolyte handling. A greater predisposition to hyponatremia occurs in times of elevated progesterone, and in menopausal women, who are slower to excrete water. Additionally, females have less absolute and relative fluid available to lose via sweating than males, making the physiological consequences of fluid loss more severe, particularly in the luteal phase. 8. Evidence for sex-specific supplementation is lacking due to the paucity of female-specific research and any differential effects in females. Caffeine, iron, and creatine have the most evidence for use in females. Both iron and creatine are highly efficacious for female athletes. Creatine supplementation of 3 to 5 g per day is recommended for the mechanistic support of creatine supplementation with regard to muscle protein kinetics, growth factors, satellite cells, myogenic transcription factors, glycogen and calcium regulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Post-menopausal females benefit from bone health, mental health, and skeletal muscle size and function when consuming higher doses of creatine (0.3 g·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>). 9. To foster and promote high-quality research investigations involving female athletes, researchers are first encouraged to stop excluding females unless the primary endpoints are directly influenced by sex-specific mechanisms. In all investigative scenarios, researchers across the globe are encouraged to inquire and report upon more detailed information surrounding the athlete's hormonal status, including menstrual status (days since menses, length of period, duration of cycle, etc.) and/or hormonal contraceptive details and/or menopausal status.",['Sims ST; Kerksick CM; Smith-Ryan AE; Janse de Jonge XAK; Hirsch KR; Arent SM; Hewlings SJ; Kleiner SM; Bustillo E; Tartar JL; Starratt VG; Kreider RB; Greenwalt C; Rentería LI; Ormsbee MJ; VanDusseldorp TA; Campbell BI; Kalman DS; Antonio J'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37221858,female athletes have unique and unpredictable hormone profiles. female athletes should track their hormonal status against training and recovery. female athletes should achieve adequate energy intake to meet energy requirements.
"Anemia among Adolescent Girls in West Java, Indonesia: Related Factors and Consequences on the Quality of Life.","Anemia in adolescent girls is still a problem in Indonesia. The impact of anemia is quite significant for adolescent health. This study aims to analyze related factors of anemia among adolescent girls, and the effect of anemia on the quality of life. The study was conducted in the Soreang District, West Java, Indonesia. This cross-sectional study involved 286 female students (15−19 years). A 24-h recall questionnaire was used to collect the nutrient intake. We use the WHOQOL-BREF to analyze the quality of life. The study assessed height, weight, body mass index (BMI), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and a capillary blood sample to determine hemoglobin levels. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression tests were measured to find the factors most influencing anemia. The prevalence of anemia was 14.3%. Related factors of anemia in this study were: duration of blood show per menses, iron consumption, weight, height, and MUAC. From bivariate analyses, anemia influenced the social relationships domain with p < 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the most influencing factors for anemia were MUAC and duration of blood per menses. Anemia impacted the social relationships domain. In this study, the two main factors that affected anemia were MUAC and duration of blood each menstrual cycle.",['Sari P; Herawati DMD; Dhamayanti M; Hilmanto D'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36145153,anemia in adolescent girls still a problem in Indonesia. impact of anemia is quite significant for adolescent health.
Osteoporosis. Medical prevention and treatment.,"Osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterized by deficient bone mass and fragility fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine. The therapeutic strategies for treating osteoporosis are designed to maximize peak bone mass through proper nutrition, appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, maintenance of physiologic menstrual cycles, and a program of weight bearing and strengthening exercises. For the conditions of high bone turnover--osteoporosis in which osteoclastic resorption is increased--efficacious treatment options include hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates. Osteoporosis with low bone turnover results from deficient osteoblastic bone formation and responds to the experimental drug programs of fluoride, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone related peptide analogues. Determination of bone density defines the patient's current condition, measurement of the level of N-telopeptides (collagen breakdown products) predicts the patient's future regarding osteoporotic fractures, and the presence of risk factors for hip fracture establish the therapeutic window for treatment.",['Lane JM'],1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9431642,"osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterized by deficient bone mass and fragility fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine. the therapeutic strategies for treating osteoporosis are designed to maximize peak bone mass through proper nutrition, appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D."
"Menstrual hygiene management practice among adolescent girls: an urban-rural comparative study in Rajshahi division, Bangladesh.","Adolescence is a critical period characterized by significant physical, emotional, cognitive, and social changes, including the monthly occurrence of menstruation of adolescent girls. Despite being an inevitable natural event, most societies consider menstruation and menstrual blood as taboos and impure. Such consideration prevents many adolescent girls from proper health education and information related to menstrual health, which forces them to develop their ways of managing the event. This study attempted to explore the pattern, the urban-rural differences, and the determinants of menstrual hygiene management practices (MHMP) among adolescent girls in the Rajshahi division, Bangladesh. Using a cross-sectional study design with multistage random sampling, we collected data from 586 adolescent girls (aged 14-19 years) from the Rajshahi division of Bangladesh. The MHMP was measured using eight binary items, where the value from zero to five as 'bad,' six as 'fair,' and seven-eight as 'good' practices. Finally, we employed bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis. Only 37.7% continuously used sanitary pads. Among the cloth users, nearly three-fourths reused cloths, and about 57% used water and soap to wash them. About 49% changed menstrual absorbent, and 44% washed their genitalia three times daily. About 41% used water only to wash genitalia, and 55% buried sanitary materials under the soil. Around 36.9% of the girls practiced bad, 33.4% fair, and 29.7% good menstrual management. We found significant differences in MHMP among adolescent girls between urban and rural areas (32.3% vs. 27.7% good users, p ≤ 0.05). Multinomial logistic regression found that place of residence, age, family size, parental education, and age at first menstruation were the significant determinants of MHMP. Although there are some cases of sanitary pad use, still menstrual hygiene management is unhealthy in most cases. The continuous supply of sanitary pads at affordable cost, change in existing social norms about menstruation, proper education, information, and services are essential for achieving health-related SDG goals in both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh.",['Ha MAT; Alam MZ'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35321715,"urban-rural comparative study in Rajshahi division, Bangladesh. study examined the pattern, urban-rural differences, and determinants of menstrual hygiene management practices. study was carried out by adolescent girls aged 14-19 years."
Effect of <i>Brihatyadi Yapana Basti</i> and <i>Shivalingi</i> (<i>Bryonia laciniosa</i> Linn.) seed powder in the management of female infertility (<i>Vandhyatva</i>) due to anovulatory factor: An open-labelled randomized clinical trial.,"Infertility is a global problem that has impact on quality of life, especially through the negative psycho-social consequences. One-third of infertile population attending infertility clinics are reported with anovulation.

Beyond menstrual hygiene: addressing vaginal bleeding throughout the life course in low and middle-income countries.,"Girls and women experience numerous types of vaginal bleeding. These include healthy reproductive processes, such as menstruation and bleeding after childbirth, but also bleeding related to health conditions, such as fibroids or cancer. In most societies, the management of menstruation is handled covertly, something girls are often instructed about at menarche. The management of other vaginal bleeding is often similarly discreet, although behaviours are not well documented. In many societies, cultural taboos frequently hinder open discussion around vaginal bleeding, restricting information and early access to healthcare. Additionally, the limited availability of clean, accessible water and sanitation facilities in many low and middle-income countries augments the challenges girls and women face in conducting daily activities while managing vaginal bleeding, including participating in school or work, going to the market or fetching water. This paper aims to highlight the key vaginal bleeding experiences throughout a woman's life course and the intersection of these bleeding experiences with their access to adequate water and sanitation facilities, information and education sources, and supplies. The aim is to address the silence around girls and women's vaginal bleeding and their related social, physical and clinical management needs across the life course; and highlight critical gaps that require attention in research, practice and policy around this neglected topic of health and gender equality.",['Sommer M; Phillips-Howard PA; Mahon T; Zients S; Jones M; Caruso BA'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29225941,"women and girls experience numerous types of vaginal bleeding. these include healthy reproductive processes, such as menstruation and bleeding after childbirth. the management of other vaginal bleeding is often similarly discreet."
The importance of vitamin D in the diagnosis and treatment of adenomyosis.,"There is still no unified theory of the occurrence of adenomyosis.

Supportive care of female hormones in brain health: what and how?,"Female hormones, functioning as neuroactive steroids, are utilized beyond menopausal hormone therapy. The rapid onset of allopregnanolone analogs, such as brexanolone and zuranolone, in treating depression, and the effectiveness of megestrol acetate in addressing appetite and weight gain, prompted the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the use of progesterone for treating postpartum depression and cancer-related cachexia. Progesterone has also been found to alleviate neuropathic pain in animal studies. These off-label applications offer a promising option for patients with advanced cancer who often experience various mood disorders such as depression, persistent pain, social isolation, and physical complications like cachexia. These patients have shown low tolerance to opioids and mood-regulating medications. However, the potential risks and uncertainties associated with hormone therapy treatment modalities can be daunting for both patients and medical professionals.

Evidence that the woman's ovarian cycle is driven by an internal circamonthly timing system.,"The ovarian cycle has a well-established circa-monthly rhythm, but the mechanisms involved in its regularity are unknown. Is the rhythmicity driven by an endogenous clock-like timer or by other internal or external processes? Here, using two large epidemiological datasets (26,912 cycles from 2303 European women and 4786 cycles from 721 North American women), analyzed with time series and circular statistics, we find evidence that the rhythmic characteristics of the menstrual cycle are more likely to be explained by an endogenous clock-like driving mechanism than by any other internal or external process. We also show that the menstrual cycle is weakly but significantly influenced by the 29.5-day lunar cycle and that the phase alignment between the two cycles differs between the European and the North American populations. Given the need to find efficient treatments of subfertility in women, our results should be confirmed in larger populations, and chronobiological approaches to optimize the ovulatory cycle should be evaluated.",['Ecochard R; Stanford JB; Fehring RJ; Schneider M; Najmabadi S; Gronfier C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38598621,the ovarian cycle has a well-established circa-monthly rhythm. the mechanisms involved in its regularity are unknown. the rhythmic characteristics of the menstrual cycle are more likely to be explained by an endogenous clock-like driving mechanism.

Prognostic value of left ventricular structure and strain in chronic kidney disease patients by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: a retrospective study.,"Individuals suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently face a heightened likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and cardiac mortality. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) is utilized to assess the micro-contraction function of the myocardium. The objective of this research is to explore the relationship between the left ventricular anatomy, myocardial strain, and the clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. A total of 77 patients with late-stage CKD were enrolled in this retrospective study. They underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and were followed up, with no history of significant cardiac diseases. The patients were divided into two groups: those with a left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) ≥ -15.2% (<i>n</i> = 49) and those with LVGLS < -15.2% (<i>n</i> = 28). The clinical endpoints were defined as hospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. Over an average observation period of 22 ± 9 months, 11 (14%) patients passed away and 30 (39%) were admitted to the hospital for heart failure, with eight encountering both incidents. Those with LVGLS ≥ -15.2% had markedly lower rates of event-free survival concerning heart failure admissions and overall mortality than their counterparts (log-rank <i>P</i> = 0.014). Cox multivariable analysis indicated that reduced LVGLS consistently predicted a higher likelihood of combined outcomes of heart failure admissions and total mortality (HR: 3.40, 95% CI [1.35-8.56], <i>P</i> = 0.009), even when factoring in age, diabetes, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). However, the LVMI showed no significant correlation with the risk of heart failure admissions or overall mortality. Compared to patients with LVGLS < -15.2%, CKD patients with LVGLS ≥ -15.2% have an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality. The prognostic role of LVMI in assessing CKD patients among the Asian population requires further investigation.",['Zhang W; Zhong Y; Zhong F; Zhang T; Zhu X; Fan W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39104364,patients with chronic kidney disease often face a heightened likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular complications. cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) is used to assess the micro-contraction function of the myocardium.
Visual scale to document acute dizziness in the hospital.,"Managing acute vertigo/dizziness for inpatients requires valid communication between the various healthcare professionals that triage such life-threatening presentations, yet there are no current scaling methods for managing such acute vertigo symptoms for inpatients. To describe the development and validation of the Krems Acute Vertigo/Dizziness Scale (KAVEDIS), a new instrument for tracking subjective symptoms (vertigo, dizziness) and gait impairment across four unique vestibular diagnoses (Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, peripheral vestibular hypofunction, and vestibular migraine) over a one-year period after inpatient hospital admission. Retrospective data collection study from KAVEDIS scale and chart documentation.

How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women?,"Female sex is a prominent risk factor for chronic pain, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between age at menopause, reproductive lifespan, and chronic pain in a sample of postmenopausal women aged 40 to 93 years. Data were collected from the Tromsø study conducted in Norway between 2015 and 2016 (Tromsø7). Chronic pain was assessed using a single question, which formed a sample size of 5741 participants. Chronic widespread pain was evaluated using the more comprehensive Graphical Index of Pain, resulting in a sample size of 5920 women. Premenopausal women and those who experienced menstrual cessation due to chemotherapy/radiation or hormonal intrauterine devices were excluded from the analysis. Adjusted relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine associations. The results showed that early menopause was associated with a 1% increase in the prevalence of chronic pain for each year of earlier onset at menopause (0.992, CI 95% 0.985-0.998). This association was also observed in women who experienced natural menopause only. However, the association between menopause and chronic widespread pain did not reach statistical significance in the fully adjusted analysis (0.996, CI 95% 0.975-1.017). There were no significant associations found between reproductive lifespan and either outcome. In conclusion, the findings suggest that early menopause in postmenopausal women is linked to a higher prevalence of chronic pain. However, reproductive lifespan does not appear to have a significant impact on chronic pain or chronic widespread pain.",['Lund CI; Rosseland LA; Steingrímsdóttir ÓA; Engdahl BL; Stubhaug A; Furberg AS; Nielsen CS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058956,study aimed to investigate relationship between age at menopause and chronic pain in postmenopausal women. a sample size of 5920 women was formed using a single question. early menopause was associated with a 1% increase in chronic pain for each year of earlier onset at menopause.
SARS-CoV-2 population dynamics in immunocompetent individuals in a closed transmission chain shows genomic diversity over the course of infection.,"SARS-CoV-2 remains rapidly evolving, and many biologically important genomic substitutions/indels have characterised novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages, which have emerged during successive global waves of the pandemic. Worldwide genomic sequencing has been able to monitor these waves, track transmission clusters, and examine viral evolution in real time to help inform healthcare policy. One school of thought is that an apparent greater than average divergence in an emerging lineage from contemporary variants may require persistent infection, for example in an immunocompromised host. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and sampling, there were few studies that examined the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy individuals. We investigated viral evolutionary trends and participant symptomatology within a cluster of 16 SARS-CoV-2 infected, immunocompetent individuals with no co-morbidities in a closed transmission chain. Longitudinal nasopharyngeal swab sampling allowed characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variation over time at both the dominant and minor genomic variant levels through Nimagen-Illumina sequencing. A change in viral lineage assignment was observed in individual infections; however, there was only one indel and no evidence of recombination over the period of an acute infection. Minor and dominant genomic modifications varied between participants, with some minor genomic modifications increasing in abundance to become the dominant viral sequence during infection. Data from this cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected participants demonstrated that long-term persistent infection in an immunocompromised host was not necessarily a prerequisite for generating a greater than average frequency of amino acid substitutions. Amino acid substitutions at both the dominant and minor genomic sequence level were observed in immunocompetent individuals during infection showing that viral lineage changes can occur generating viral diversity.",['Goldswain H; Penrice-Randal R; Donovan-Banfield I; Duffy CW; Dong X; Randle N; Ryan Y; Rzeszutek AM; Pilgrim J; Keyser E; Weller SA; Hutley EJ; Hartley C; Prince T; Darby AC; Aye Maung N; Nwume H; Hiscox JA; Emmett SR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39014481,"genome sequencing has been able to monitor these waves, track transmission clusters, and examine viral evolution in real time. a divergence in emerging lineage from contemporary variants may require persistent infection, for example in an immunocompromised host."
A Prediction Model for the Efficacy of Transvaginal Repair in Patients With Cesarean Scar Defect: An Evidence-Based Proposal for Patient Selection.,"To establish a prediction model to help doctors determine which patients with cesarean scar defect are more suitable for transvaginal repair. Retrospective analysis. Xinhua Hospital and Shanghai First Maternity & Infant Hospital between June 2014 and May 2021. 1015 women who underwent transvaginal repair of cesarean scar defect (CSD). All enrolled patients underwent CSD repair performed by the same gynecologist and his team. And followed up a clinic visit at 6 months to record their menstruation and measure multiple parameters of the CSD by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. CSD patients are categorized as optimal healing group when the menstruation duration is no more than 7 days, meanwhile the thickness of residual myometrium is no less than 5.39 mm after vaginal repair. The final nomogram is constructed to predict surgical outcomes based on preoperative variables. The key factors that determine optimal healing are the timing of cesarean section (elective or emergency), menstrual cycle, CSD length, width, depth, and the thickness of the lower uterine segment. With the prediction model, scores are given to each parameter according to the statistics. Total scores range from 0 to 25 points, with a cutoff point of 16.5. When a score is greater than 16.5, the transvaginal repair can achieve optimal healing. Uterine position (anteflexion or retroflexion) and preoperative thickness of residual myometrium are the key factors affecting postoperative thickness of residual myometrium. The width of the CSD and the thickness of the lower uterine segment are the key factors affecting abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms (p < 0.01). For the first time, we established a prediction model system that may predict the repair effect of CSD and can potentially be useful in future clinical trials to determine which patients are more suitable for surgery or other treatment options.",['Zhou X; Gao Z; Chen H; Wang Y; Yin Y; Zhang J; Wang X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38135001,1015 women underwent transvaginal repair of cesarean scar defect. all enrolled patients underwent CSD repair performed by the same gynecologist.
Challenges in diagnosis and health care in polycystic ovary syndrome in Canada: a patient view to improve health care.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder affecting health and quality of life of those affected across the lifespan. We currently have limited evidence-based data on the experience of those living with PCOS in the health care system including diagnosis, health concerns and disease management. The aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of health status, health care experience and disease management support in those affected by PCOS in Alberta, Canada. An online questionnaire was completed via REDCap by individuals self-reporting a diagnosis of PCOS. Question categories included demographics, symptoms of PCOS and time to confirm a diagnosis, follow-up care, health concerns, and information resources. Descriptive statistics were used and thematic analyses was applied to open-response questions. Responses from 194 participants living in Canada (93% in Alberta) were included. The average age was 34 ± 8 years and BMI was 35 ± 9. Menstrual irregularity was identified in 84% of respondents as the first symptom noticed and the primary reason for seeking a medical consultation. A PCOS diagnosis occurred on average 4.3 years following awareness of first symptoms and required consultation with more than one primary care provider for 57% of respondents. Half (53%) of respondents reported not receiving a referral to specialists for follow-up care and 70% were not informed about long-term health morbidity such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Most respondents (82%) did their own research about PCOS using on-line sources, academic literature and advice from peer support. The participant themes from open questions for improving health care included more resources and support, increased and reliable information, better education and training for clinicians, timely diagnosis, prompt referrals to specialists, and generally more compassion and empathy to the challenges faced by those managing their disease. Our findings highlight the health concerns and challenges in health care for those with PCOS. In Alberta, Canada we have identified major gaps in health care including a timely diagnosis, follow up care and supports, and multidisciplinary care. This evidence-based data can be used to inform development of pathways to improve the health care experience in those affected by PCOS.",['Sydora BC; Wilke MS; McPherson M; Chambers S; Ghosh M; Vine DF'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37925392,"polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder affecting health and quality of life of those affected across the lifespan. the aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of health status, health care experience and disease management support in those affected by PCOS in Alberta, Canada."
Safety profiles of offspring born from early-follicular long-acting GnRH agonist protocol and daily mid-luteal GnRH agonist protocol: a retrospective study.,"The gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) have been widely used for controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technology (ART). The early-follicular long-acting GnRH-a long protocol (EFL) and the luteal phase short-acting GnRH-a long protocol (LPS) are commonly used GnRH agonist protocols. We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess and compare the rates of congenital abnormalities and safety profiles in offspring born from the EFL and LPS protocols. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to analyze and compare neonatal data from patients who using EFL or LPS protocols at our center between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017. The study ultimately included 1810 neonates from 1401 cycles using the EFL protocol and 2700 neonates from 2129 cycles using the LPS protocol.The main outcome measures are gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and congenital anomaly rate.To assess the influence of various factors on congenital abnormalities, a random-effects logistic regression model was employed. The EFL and LPS protocols led to similar congenital anomaly rates (1.64% vs. 2.35%, P = 0.149). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding birth weight and its categories, newborn gender and congenital anomaly rate. The results of the multivariate logistic regression model indicated no association between congenital anomaly and BMI, duration of infertility, treatment protocol, fertilization method, or embryo transfer stage. Compared with singleton pregnancies, the probability of congenital defects in multiple pregnancies was 2.64 times higher (OR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.72-4.05, P < 0.0001). Newborns with congenital defects were born with a lower gestational age compared with full-term pregnancies. In conclusion, the EFL protocol is considered a safe option for ensuring offspring safety, comparable with the LPS protocol; however, multiple pregnancies represent an independent risk factor for congenital abnormalities. This approach can be widely adopted; however, prioritizing single embryo transfers is strongly recommended to minimize the potential risks associated with multiple pregnancies in offspring.",['Du L; Song J; Fan W; Ye T; Kong H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38807043,retrospective study compared safety profiles of offspring born from the protocols. the early-follicular long-acting GnRH-a long protocol (EFL) and the luteal phase short-acting GnRH-a long protocol (LPS) are commonly used.
Trends and Inequities in Use of Abortion Services in Nepal: A Nepal Demographic and Health Survey Data Analysis 1996-2022 A.D.,"Despite policy advances and public health initiatives in Nepal to improve access to reproductive healthcare, disparities persist in utilization of abortion services. Grounded in longitudinal data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey from 1996 to 2022, this study aims to shed light on evolving patterns in pregnancy outcomes and inequities in use of abortion services across ecological zones and wealth quintiles. Utilizing six rounds of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data, pregnancy outcomes were categorized as abortion, delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Income-related inequality in the utilization of abortion services was assessed through the concentration index, ranging from -1 to 1. Trends over time were evaluated using the annual rate of change. The ARC indicated a substantial rise in induced abortion rates, surging from 0.4% in 1996 to 8.8% in 2022. In contrast, live births witnessed a decline from 92.8% to 81.2%. Significant variations were observed across ecological zones and wealth quintiles, with the Mountain zone and the Poorest group experiencing the most pronounced increases in induced abortion rates. By 2022, the concentration index reached a near-zero value, signifying a near-elimination of income-related disparities in the use of induced abortion services. The findings suggest that while there has been significant progress in access to and use of abortion services in Nepal, particularly post-2002 policy shifts, challenges remain. Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds continue to face barriers, indicating the need for a multi-pronged approach to address residual challenges. Nepal has made remarkable strides in enhancing equitable access to and use of induced abortion services, but more needs to be done to guarantee equitable access for all women. Future efforts should focus on policy reforms, infrastructural improvements, and societal change to eliminate existing barriers to reproductive healthcare.",['Gautam M; Mehata S; Karki S; Ghimire J; Maharjan S; Dotel BR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080935,"trends and inequities in abortion services in Nepal were categorized as abortion, delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth. despite policy advances and public health initiatives in Nepal, disparities persist in utilization of abortion services."
Effect of prematurely elevated late follicular progesterone on pregnancy outcomes following ovarian stimulation-intrauterine insemination for unexplained infertility: secondary analysis of the AMIGOS trial.,"What is the relationship between late follicular phase progesterone levels and clinic pregnancy and live birth rates in couples with unexplained infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation with IUI (OS-IUI)? Late follicular progesterone levels between 1.0 and <1.5 ng/ml were associated with higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates while the outcomes in groups with higher progesterone levels did not differ appreciably from the <1.0 ng/ml reference group. Elevated late follicular progesterone levels have been associated with lower live birth rates after fresh embryo transfer following controlled ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, but less is known about whether an association exists with outcomes in OS-IUI cycles. Existing studies are few and have been limited to ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins, but the use of oral agents, such as clomiphene citrate and letrozole, is common with these treatments and has not been well studied. The study was a prospective cohort analysis of the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) randomized controlled trial. Frozen serum was available for evaluation from 2121 cycles in 828 AMIGOS participants. The primary pregnancy outcome was live birth per cycle, and the secondary pregnancy outcome was clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. Couples with unexplained infertility in the AMIGOS trial, for whom female serum from day of trigger with hCG was available in at least one cycle of treatment, were included. Stored frozen serum samples from day of hCG trigger during treatment with OS-IUI were evaluated for serum progesterone level. Progesterone level <1.0 ng/ml was the reference group for comparison with progesterone categorized in increments of 0.5 ng/ml up to ≥3.0 ng/ml. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI were estimated using cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations to estimate modified Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Compared to the reference group with 110/1363 live births (8.07%), live birth rates were significantly increased in cycles with progesterone 1.0 to <1.5 ng/ml (49/401 live births, 12.22%) in both the unadjusted (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14, 2.13) and treatment-adjusted models (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10, 2.06). Clinical pregnancy rates were also higher in this group (55/401 clinical pregnancies, 13.72%) compared to reference group with 130/1363 (9.54%) (unadjusted RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10, 1.94 and adjusted RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07, 1.89). In cycles with progesterone 1.5 ng/ml and above, there was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy or live birth rates relative to the reference group. This pattern remained when stratified by ovarian stimulation treatment group but was only statistically significant in letrozole cycles. The AMIGOS trial was not designed to answer this clinical question, and with small numbers in some progesterone categories our analyses were underpowered to detect differences between some groups. Inclusion of cycles with progesterone values above 3.0 ng/ml may have included those wherein ovulation had already occurred at the time the IUI was performed. These cycles would be expected to experience a lower success rate but pregnancy may have occurred with intercourse in the same cycle. Compared to previous literature focusing primarily on OS-IUI cycles using gonadotrophins, these data include patients using oral agents and therefore may be generalizable to the wider population of infertility patients undergoing IUI treatments. Because live births were significantly higher when progesterone ranged from 1.0 to <1.5 ng/ml, further study is needed to clarify whether this progesterone range may truly represent a prognostic indicator in OS-IUI cycles.

Period Product Insecurity Is Increasing in the United States: Trends from 2018 to 2021.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Data documenting period product insecurity, or an inability to access products, in the United States have recently emerged. With multiple years of data now available, we assessed trends in period product insecurity among two nationally representative samples of U.S. adults. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Data from nationally representative, cross-sectional online surveys conducted in January 2018 and April 2021 were used to run weighted logistic regressions. Those aged 18-49 years and who had menstruated in the past year (<i>n</i> = 922 in 2018; <i>n</i> = 1037 in 2021) were included. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In 2021, 59% experienced period product insecurity compared with 53% in 2018. In 2018 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.91, confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.29-2.83) and 2021 (aOR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06-2.21), Hispanic respondents were more likely to find products unaffordable.

The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate.,"Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman's quality of life.",['Dunphy L; Boyle S; Wood F'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38160030,"up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). a plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment."
Using motion-detection cameras to monitor foraging behaviour of individual butterflies.,"The activity of many animals follows recurrent patterns and foraging is one of the most important processes in their daily activity. Determining movement in the search for resources and understanding temporal and spatial patterns in foraging has therefore long been central in behavioural ecology. However, identifying and monitoring animal movements is often challenging. In this study we assess the use of camera traps to track a very specific and small-scale interactions focused on the foraging behaviour of Heliconiini butterflies. Data on floral visitation was recorded using marked individuals of three pollen-feeding species of <i>Heliconius</i> (<i>H. erato</i>, <i>H. melpomene</i> and <i>H. sara</i>), and two closely related, non-pollen feeding species (<i>Dryas iulia</i> and <i>Dryadula phaetusa</i>) in a large outdoor insectary. We demonstrate that camera traps efficiently capture individual flower visitation over multiple times and locations and use our experiments to describe some features of their spatial and temporal foraging patterns. Heliconiini butterflies showed higher activity in the morning with strong temporal niche overlap. Differences in foraging activity between males and females was observed with females foraging earlier than males, mirroring published field studies. Some flowers were more explored than others, which may be explained by butterflies foraging simultaneously affecting each other's flower choices. Feeding was grouped in short periods of intense visits to the same flower, which we refer to as feeding bouts. <i>Heliconius</i> also consistently visits the same flower, while non-<i>Heliconius</i> visited a greater number of flowers per day and their feeding bouts were shorter compared with <i>Heliconius</i>. This is consistent with <i>Heliconius</i> having more stable long-term spatial memory and foraging preferences than outgroup genera. More broadly, our study demonstrates that camera traps can provide a powerful tool to gather information about foraging behaviour in small insects such as butterflies. © 2024 The Authors.

Sex Hormones Influence the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch Effect.,"Saturated lights appear brighter than white lights of the same luminance. This is the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (H-K) effect, and the phenomenon can be estimated by modeling achromatic luminance and saturation to total brightness. Current H-K effect models are different between women and men and are also more variable in women, which may be due to hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle (MC). Total brightness (B) and achromatic luminance (L) were measured across blue, green, yellow-green, yellow, and red hues. These data were measured along with salivary hormone levels for nine cycling women and seven oral contraceptive (OC) users at points representing the menstrual, peri-ovulation, and luteal phases. Simple brightness/luminance (B/L) ratio estimates of the H-K effect did not differ by OC use or MC phase, but B/L ratios were higher for the red stimulus in cycling women than OC users during the luteal phase. Estrogen, progesterone, and their interaction predicted 18% of the variation in brightness for cycling women. For OC users, only estrogen could be fit to brightness models where it accounted for 5% of brightness variance. These findings first provide clear support for separating cycling women from OC users, particularly when examining long-wavelength mechanisms. Next, the interaction of OC use and MC phase on B/L ratios for the red stimulus adds to a rich history of long-wavelength mechanisms. Lastly, the current result amends previous brightness models with multiple hormone terms for cycling women but not OC users.",['K Foutch B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38638628,"achromatic luminance and saturation to total brightness were measured across blue, green, yellow-green, yellow, and red hues. the phenomenon can be estimated by modeling achromatic luminance and saturation to total brightness."
A Social Media Survey of US Adolescent Preferences for Menstrual Bleeding Patterns.,"To assess preferences for menstrual pattern and acceptability and knowledge about the safety of induced amenorrhea among adolescents and young adults METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of US residents aged 14-24 years at least 1 year post-menarche. Online recruitment was conducted via the social media platform TikTok on a teen reproductive health channel. Survey questions focused on menstrual history, menstrual pattern preferences, and demographic characteristics. The primary outcome was the proportion of postmenstrual individuals who would prefer amenorrhea vs scheduled bleeding. From 5113 potential respondents who accessed the eligibility screening, 3001 completed surveys and met the inclusion criteria. Most were aged 14-18 (63.7%), distributed proportionally among all US Census regions. When asked if they could pick their period-bleeding style without any permanent impacts, almost three-quarters chose no bleeding at all (amenorrhea; 71.5%) compared with scheduled periods (28.5%). However, 63.7% agreed or were uncertain when faced with the statement ""It might be unsafe if hormone medications stop your period bleeding."" After adjusting for age, gender expression, race, religion, heavy bleeding, and frequent bleeding, factors associated with preference for amenorrhea vs regular bleeding were younger age, masculine gender expression, White race, and non-Christian religious background. Baseline bleeding amount and frequency were not associated with preference for amenorrhea. More than two-thirds of US adolescents and young adults indicated a preference for medication-induced amenorrhea if the method was assured to not have any permanent effects on the body, despite highly prevalent misconceptions about health and safety.",['Boehnlein C; Boniface ER; Packham AJ; Baldwin MK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37935280,"online survey of US residents aged 14-24 years at least 1 year post-menarche. survey questions menstrual history, menstrual pattern preferences, demographic characteristics. most were aged 14-18 (63.7%), distributed proportionally among all US Census regions."
"Impact of Menstrual cycle-based Periodized training on Aerobic performance, a Clinical Trial study protocol-the IMPACT study.","The menstrual cycle and its impact on training and performance are of growing interest. However, evidence is lacking whether periodized exercise based on the menstrual cycle is beneficial. The primary purpose of this proposed randomized, controlled trial, the IMPACT study, is to evaluate the effect of exercise periodization during different phases of the menstrual cycle, i.e., comparing follicular phase-based and luteal phase-based training with regular training during the menstrual cycle on physical performance in well-trained women. Healthy, well-trained, eumenorrheic women between 18 and 35 years (n = 120) will be recruited and first assessed for physical performance during a run-in menstrual cycle at different cycle phases and then randomized to three different interventions: follicular phase-based training, luteal phase-based training, or regular training during three menstrual cycles. The training intervention will consist of high-intensity spinning classes followed by strength training. The menstrual cycle phases will be determined by serum hormone analysis throughout the intervention period. Assessment of aerobic performance (primary outcome) and muscle strength, body composition, and blood markers will be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention.

PPD data from published trials and research articles (period from 2012 to 2022) were assessed through PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using the following terms: Depression, pregnancy, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH VD), vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and postpartum (PP). Articles were selected manually and with careful tracking to avoid duplication. Articles that investigated any association between VD levels during pregnancy and PPD in the time frame were included in the study, while articles investigating VD levels of PP without depression were excluded. In this narrative review, five out of seven studies showed an association between PPD and VDD during pregnancy. Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) enrolled among different studies from 3 days to 1 year PP to assess PPD. Pregnant women with VDD are significantly associated with PPD. Longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the association between VDD with PPD. Screening VD levels among pre-postnatal mothers may be essential for awareness programs that can be implemented to promote remission of postnatal depression.",['Bateineh S; Atoum MF'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100406,postpartum depression develops in the first year. many studies evaluated the impact of vitamin D levels on depression during pregnancy and postnatal.
"Resting Energy Expenditure, Metabolic and Sex Hormones in Two Phases of the Menstrual and Hormonal Contraceptive Cycles.","Resting energy expenditure (REE) may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle (MC), due to the physiological effects of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). This study examined changes in REE and metabolic hormones (leptin, ghrelin, thyroid hormones), and dietary intake in two hormonally distinct groups, naturally menstruating women (NoOC) and women using monophasic combined oral contraceptives (COC). Measurements included REE by indirect calorimetry, body composition by bioimpedance, and blood samples for hormone analysis in the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the MC in NoOC-group (n = 38) or the active and inactive phases of the COC cycle (COC, n = 19). Participants recorded their food intake for 3 days after measurements. A secondary analysis was completed for the NoOC-group without REE outliers (difference between measurements >1.5 × interquartile range, n = 4). In the NoOC-group, luteal phase REE was 40 kcal higher than follicular phase REE [95% confidence interval (CI): -2 kcal/d-82 kcal/d, d = 0.20, p = 0.061]. Leptin (d = 0.35, p < 0.001), T3 (d = 0.26, p = 0.05) and fat intake (d = 0.48, p = 0.027) were lower, and T4 (d = 0.21, p = 0.041) was higher in the luteal phase. After excluding outliers, REE was 44 kcal higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (95% CI: 12 kcal/d-76 kcal/d, d = 0.22, p = 0.007). In the COC-group, the mean difference in REE was -2 kcal (95% CI-82 kcal/d-79 kcal/d) between active and inactive phases, while T3 was higher in the inactive phase (d = 0.01, p = 0.037). REE increases only slightly from the follicular to the luteal phase but remains unchanged between COC phases. Increases in T3, leptin, and fat intake during the luteal phase might echo metabolic fluctuations that parallel female sex hormones during the MC.",['Löfberg IE; Karppinen JE; Laatikainen-Raussi V; Lehti M; Hackney AC; Ihalainen JK; Mikkonen RS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39086066,Resting energy expenditure may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. study examined changes in REE and metabolic hormones. participants recorded food intake for 3 days after measurements.
Effectiveness of marine protected areas in safeguarding important migratory megafauna habitat.,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a commonly used management tool to safeguard marine life from anthropogenic impacts, yet their efficacy often remains untested. Evaluating how highly dynamic marine species use static MPAs is challenging but becoming more feasible with the advancement of telemetry data. Here, we focus on southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, SRWs) in the waters off Aotearoa/New Zealand, which declined from 30,000 whales to fewer than 40 mature females due to whaling. Now numbering in the low thousands, the key socializing and nursery areas for this population in the remote subantarctic islands are under the protection of different types of MPAs. However, the effectiveness of these MPAs in encompassing important whale habitat and protecting the whales from vessel traffic has not been investigated. To address this, we analyzed telemetry data from 29 SRWs tagged at the Auckland Islands between 2009 and 2022. We identified two previously unknown and currently unprotected areas that were used by the whales for important behaviors such as foraging, socializing, or resting. Additionally, by combining whale locations and vessel tracking data (2020-2022) during peak breeding period (June to October), we found high spatiotemporal overlap between whales and vessels within several MPAs, suggesting the whales could still be vulnerable to multiple anthropogenic stressors even when within areas designated for protection. Our results identify areas to be prioritized for future monitoring and investigation to support the ongoing recovery of this SRW population, as well as highlight the overarching importance of assessing MPA effectiveness post-implementation, especially in a changing climate.",['Zhang X; Carroll EL; Constantine R; Andrews-Goff V; Childerhouse S; Cole R; Goetz KT; Meyer C; Ogle M; Harcourt R; Stuck E; Zerbini AN; Riekkola L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116808,marine protected areas (MPAs) are a commonly used management tool to safeguard marine life from anthropogenic impacts. but their efficacy often remains untested. telemetry data from 29 SRWs tagged at the Auckland Islands between 2009 and 2022.
Benzodiazepine Prescription Patterns After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in U.S. Military Service Members.,"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and clinical recommendations (CRs) are developed to aide and guide providers in treating a variety of conditions, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is little knowledge on the impact that CPGs and CRs have on provider practice. One TBI recommendation that was able to be tracked in medical record codes was the use of benzodiazepines (BZD). Because of potential for misuse, diversion, addiction, cognitive impairment, and brain healing interference, the DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) jointly discourage prescribing BZD after TBI. As part of an effort to look at translation of CPG guidance into clinical practice, our objective was to examine the issuance of BZD prescriptions, including dose, type, and prescribing provider, prescribing setting, and primary diagnosis at issuance among U.S. service members with mild Traumatic Brian Injury (mTBI). Using DoD data sourced from the Comprehensive Ambulatory/Professional Encounter Record (CAPER) databases of the Military Health System (MHS) Medical Data Repository (MDR), we identified all U.S. service members with a first lifetime diagnosis of mTBI from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Data on prescriptions issued to this group during a period of active treatment for a mTBI were obtained from the Pharmacy Detail Transaction Service (PDTS) databases of the MDR and identified BZD prescriptions based on the American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) therapeutic classification system. We validated coding assumptions through structured review of the clinical record contained within the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) of 30 randomly selected cohort members. Among U.S. service members, 4.5% filled a BZD prescription while under active medical treatment for a recent mTBI. These service members were more likely female and older when compared to their counterparts not prescribed BZD. Among service members under active treatment for mTBI during the study period, 52.6% (n = 7,935) filled a prescription; of these, 8.5% (n = 676) filled a BZD prescription. Of U.S. service members filing a BZD prescription while undergoing active treatment for an mTBI, 64.6% (n = 437) filled prescriptions for BZD and antidepressants, 54.9% (n = 371) filled prescriptions for both BZD and NSAIDS, and 42.2% (n = 285) concurrently filled prescriptions for BZD and opioids. This effort to examine the translation of CPG recommendations into practice through evaluation of medical record data indicates that providers are prescribing BZD to patients under active treatment for an acute mTBI. The mTBI CPG recommends that the BZD class of medications be avoided in patients healing from brain injury. However, the team recognizes there are confounding factors that may impact the medications that are prescribed for patients with mTBI. Additional work to understand how CPGs and CRs are received and utilized by providers may elucidate opportunities to close the gap between clinical practice guidance and clinical practice.",['Earyes L; Agimi Y; Stout K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39028226,"clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and clinical recommendations (CRs) are developed to aide providers in treating a variety of conditions, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) there is little knowledge on the impact that CPGs and CRs have on provider practice."
Development and identification of a novel wheat-Thinopyrum ponticum disomic substitution line DS5Ag(5D) with new genes conferring resistance to powdery mildew and leaf rust.,"Powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt)) and leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt)) are prevalent diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. Thinopyrum ponticum (2n = 10x = 70, E<sup>e</sup>E<sup>e</sup>E<sup>b</sup>E<sup>b</sup>E<sup>x</sup>E<sup>x</sup>StStStSt) contains genes that confer high levels of resistance to these diseases. An elite wheat-Th. ponticum disomic substitution line, DS5Ag(5D), was developed in the Bainong Aikang 58 (AK58) background. The line was assessed using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), oligo-nucleotide probe multiplex (ONPM) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular markers. Twenty eight chromosome-specific molecular markers were identified for the alien chromosome, and 22 of them were co-dominant. Additionally, SNP markers from the wheat 660 K SNP chip were utilized to confirm chromosome identification and they provide molecular tools for tagging the chromosome in concern. The substitution line demonstrated high levels of resistance to powdery mildew throughout its growth period and to leaf rust at the adult stage. Based on the resistance evaluation of five F<sub>5</sub> populations between the substitution lines and wheat genotypes with different levels of sensitivity to the two diseases. Results showed that the resistance genes located on 5Ag confered stable resistance against both diseases across different backgrounds. Resistance spectrum analysis combined with diagnostic marker detection of known resistance genes of Th. ponticum revealed that 5Ag contained two novel genes, Pm5Ag and Lr5Ag, which conferred resistance to powdery mildew and leaf rust, respectively. In this study, a novel wheat-Th. ponticum disomic substitution line DS5Ag(5D) was successfully developed. The Th. ponticum chromosome 5Ag contain new resistance genes for powdery mildew and leaf rust. Chromosomic-specific molecular markers were generated and they can be used to track the 5Ag chromosome fragments. Consequently, this study provides new elite germplasm resources and molecular markers to facilitate the breeding of wheat varieties that is resistant to powdery mildew and leaf rust.",['Zhang J; Jie Y; Yan L; Wang M; Dong Y; Pang Y; Ren C; Song J; Chen X; Li X; Zhang P; Yang D; Zhang Y; Qi Z; Ru Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069623,wheat-Th. ponticum disomic substitution line DS5Ag(5D) contains new genes conferring resistance to powdery mildew and leaf rust. the line was developed in the Bainong Aikang 58 (AK58) background.
Menstrual and reproductive issues in adolescents with physical and developmental disabilities.,"Most obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter adolescents with disabilities in their practice, because developmental and physical disabilities are common in young patients (8.4%). Reproductive health issues such as puberty, sexuality, and menstruation can be more complicated for teenagers with disabilities and their families as a result of concerns surrounding menstrual hygiene, abuse risk, vulnerability, changes in seizure pattern, and altered mood. Teenagers with disabilities have gynecologic health care needs similar to those of their peers as well as unique needs related to their physical and cognitive issues. The gynecologic health visit for a teenager with disabilities should include an evaluation of the teenager's reproductive knowledge as well as an assessment of her abuse and coercion risk and her ability to consent to sexual activity. The menstrual history is focused on the effects of menstrual cycles on her daily life. Diagnostic testing is not different from other adolescents. Hormonal treatment is often requested by the patient and her family to alleviate abnormal bleeding, cyclic mood changes, dysmenorrhea, or a combination of these, to assist with menstrual hygiene, and to provide contraception. Menstrual manipulation can be used to induce complete amenorrhea, regulate cycles, or decrease regular menstrual flow. However, treatment risks and side effects may have a different effect on the lives of these adolescents. The comfort level of health care providers to respond to the special concerns of adolescents with disabilities is low, and several barriers exist. This review addresses the complex issues of puberty, menstruation, sexuality, abuse, and safety highlighting the distinctive needs of this population. The options and decisions around menstrual manipulation are highlighted in detail.",['Quint EH'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25004333,obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter adolescents with disabilities in their practice. developmental and physical disabilities are common in young patients (8.4%) gynecologic health visits for a teenager with disabilities should include an evaluation of the teenager's reproductive knowledge.
Estradiol modulates changes in effective connectivity in emotion regulation networks.,"Hormonal changes in ovarian hormones like estradiol (E2) during the menstrual cycle affect emotional processes, including emotion recognition, memory, and regulation. So far, the neural underpinnings of the effect of E2 on emotional experience have been investigated using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional connectivity. In the present study, we examined whether the intrinsic network dynamics at rest (i.e., directed effective connectivity) related to emotion regulation are (1) modulated by E2 levels and (2) linked to behavioral emotion regulation ability. Hence, 29 naturally cycling women participated in two resting-state fMRI scans in their early follicular phase after being administered a placebo or an E2 valerate, respectively. Emotion regulation ability was assessed using a standard emotion regulation task in which participants were asked to down-regulate their emotions in response to negative images. The regions of two functionally predefined neural networks related to emotional down-regulation and reactivity were used to investigate effective connectivity at rest using spectral dynamic causal modelling. We found that E2, compared to placebo, resulted in changes in effective connectivity in both networks. In the regulation network, prefrontal regions showed distinct connectivity in the E2 compared to the placebo condition, while mixed results evolved in the emotional reactivity network. Stepwise regressions revealed that in the E2 condition a connection from the parietal to the prefrontal cortex predicted regulation ability. Our results demonstrate that E2 levels influence effective connectivity in networks underlying emotion regulation and emotional reactivity. Thus, E2 and its potential modification via hormonal administration may play a supporting role in the treatment of mental disorders that show a dysregulation of emotions.",['Derntl B; Eber CH; Kogler L; Rehbein E; Sundstöm-Poromaa I; Morawetz C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38924828,hormones like estradiol (E2) during the menstrual cycle affect emotional processes. neural underpinnings of the effect of E2 on emotional experience have been investigated using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Daily menstrual blood loss and quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.,"Excessive blood loss during menstruation is a major problem for women of reproductive age. Women who experience heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) often present to physicians because of the subsequent negative impact HMB has on their daily lives and activities. The objective of this post-hoc analysis is to evaluate daily menstrual blood loss (MBL) in women with HMB and assess the relationship between daily MBL and women's perceptions of MBL, limitations in physical activities and limitations in social/leisure activities as measured by the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire. Data from two randomized, placebo-controlled studies of an oral tranexamic acid formulation in women with HMB were assessed. Daily MBLs and Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire scores were evaluated for two pretreatment cycles and the first three tranexamic acid treatment cycles of each study. Effect-size analyses were not conducted. Highest daily MBLs occurred on days 2 and 3 of menstrual cycles. Women's perceptions of daily MBL were consistent with objective measures of MBL. Higher daily MBL was related to increased limitations in physical activities and limitations in social/leisure activities. Daily MBL values were consistent with women's perceptions of MBL. Reduced daily MBL was associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.",['Lukes AS; Baker J; Eder S; Adomako TL'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22934724,daily menstrual blood loss (MBL) in women with heavy menstrual bleeding is a major problem for women of reproductive age. daily MBLs and menorrhagia impact Questionnaire scores were evaluated for two pretreatment cycles.
Nephrotoxicity of Intravenous Ganciclovir in Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients.,"Associations between ganciclovir and severe nephrotoxicity are incompletely defined. Studies incorporating the time-varying nature of medication exposures and those that address confounding by indication are particularly scarce in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. We identified children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation in the Pediatric Health Information System database and tracked them for 1 year following transplantation. The primary exposure of interest was the use of ganciclovir, which was treated as a time-varying variable. Secondary exposures of interest included cidofovir, foscarnet, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin and calcineurin inhibitors. The primary outcome of interest was renal replacement therapy, which was assessed using marginal structural Cox proportional hazards regression model incorporating time-varying variables and inverse-probability-of-treatment weight. Of 17,924 children who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation during the study period, 3078 (17.2%) had exposure to ganciclovir. In marginal structural Cox proportional hazards regression model incorporating time-varying variables and inverse-probability-of-treatment weight, ganciclovir was associated with an increased hazard of renal replacement therapy (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-2.76). Some of secondary exposures of interest, including cidofovir, amphotericin B and vancomycin, also were associated with renal replacement therapy. Intravenously administered ganciclovir is associated with renal dysfunction severe enough to require renal replacement therapy in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. Ganciclovir should be used with caution and close monitoring. Approaches to mitigate the risks of nephrotoxicity should be investigated.",['Inagaki K; Vander Lugt MT; Riggsbee D; Weinberg JB'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39079040,ganciclovir was associated with increased hazard of renal replacement therapy. ganciclovir was associated with increased hazard of renal replacement therapy.
Dysregulation of immune response in PCOS organ system.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder affecting women, which can lead to infertility. Infertility, obesity, hirsutism, acne, and irregular menstruation are just a few of the issues that PCOS can be linked to. PCOS has a complicated pathophysiology and a range of clinical symptoms. Chronic low-grade inflammation is one of the features of PCOS. The inflammatory environment involves immune and metabolic disturbances. Numerous organ systems across the body, in addition to the female reproductive system, have been affected by the pathogenic role of immunological dysregulation in PCOS in recent years. Insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are associated with immune cell dysfunction and cytokine imbalance. More importantly, obesity is also involved in immune dysfunction in PCOS, leading to an inflammatory environment in women with PCOS. Hormone, obesity, and metabolic interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Hormone imbalance may also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the pathophysiological role of immune dysregulation in various organ systems of PCOS patients and provide new ideas for systemic treatment of PCOS in the future.",['Wang J; Yin T; Liu S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37215125,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder affecting women. chronic low-grade inflammation is one of the features of PCOS. inflammatory environment involves immune and metabolic disturbances.
Coming of age: a qualitative study of adolescent girls' menstrual preparedness in Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Jordan.,"Menstrual health is important for adolescent girls and is particularly compromised in displaced communities due to restricted access to information and lack of private spaces to manage menstruation. Menarche is the biological and social milestone of girls' adolescence, marking the onset of puberty and confirming womanhood in many communities. It also marks a difficult transitional period influenced by socio-cultural beliefs and expectations. Menstrual preparedness is critical for this transition, and the lack of accurate, timely, age-appropriate information might impact current, and future reproductive health and well-being. This paper investigates the menstrual preparedness status of adolescents living in Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Jordan. These are long-term refugee camps characterised by a variety of social, economic, and political constraints affecting the health of women and girls. We conducted 39 in-depth interviews and 23 focus-group discussions with adolescent girls. The study reveals inadequate menstrual preparedness among the participants, especially in pre-menarche. Among the barriers to adequate menstrual preparedness is a predominance of practical concerns, such as the use of sanitary pads and hygienic practices, socio-cultural norms that promote secrecy and taboo around menstruation, and divergent notions of timeliness of information among girls, their mothers, and teachers. The study contends that addressing the taboo around menstruation requires joint efforts by the family, school, and social services. Menstrual preparedness should begin early and encompass biological, practical, emotional, and psychological components. The paper advocates for Comprehensive, Contextually Relevant, Timely Menstrual Preparedness (CCTMP) policies and initiatives, empowering adolescent girls, their mothers, and educators.",['Ghandour R; Hammoudeh W; Giacaman R; Holmboe-Ottesen G; Fjeld HE'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36129456,menstrual preparedness is important for adolescent girls and is particularly compromised in displaced communities. menarche is the biological and social milestone of girls' adolescence. it marks the onset of puberty and confirming womanhood in many communities.
Creating an Intercultural User-Centric Design for a Digital Sexual Health Education App for Young Women in Resource-Poor Regions of Kenya: Qualitative Self-Extended Double Diamond Model for Requirements Engineering Analysis.,"The stigmatization around sexual health due to culture, religious traditions, and norms leads to myths and a lack of available information and resources related to universal access to sexual and reproductive health services. Additional sexual health education not being part of the Kenya school curriculum leads to insufficient access to knowledge about safe contraception, menstruation, and female genital mutilation. A digital app could support and provide education and information for universal equal access, addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, and 5. The study targeted the requirements for establishing a reusable framework to develop a successful accessible web-based sexual health education app and the behavioral intention to use it to obtain sexual health information by mainly young women in Kenya. The double diamond model, with a problem room including the discover and define phases, enriched with cultural aspects and modeled to a self-expanded intercultural research model was used in a user-centered design thinking approach to develop a framework for requirements engineering analysis. For problem identification, semistructured pilot phase interviews based on Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were conducted, followed by expert interviews for qualitative content analysis. A sample size of 12 pilot phase interviews and 5 expert interviews was determined using data saturation. The responses were coded and analyzed according to the affinity mapping method. The requirements engineering analysis showed potential enablers of and barriers to the use of a digital sexual health education app. Through this qualitative study, a conservative cultural background, classic text communication, and the influence of social affiliation within society were identified as barriers, which should be enhanced through visual and auditory channels as well as a fictional character in the app. The developed intercultural research model provides an impetus to providing digital sexual health education, integrating culture-specific aspects in the design process, while focusing on cultural and religious stigmata. The reusable framework enables identifying and overcoming hurdles in providing information about taboo and intimate topics. The overall use of online education tools focusing on intimate topics is correlated with accessibility and understanding specific cultural needs while delivering content on a basic and comprehensive level. It helps the target user from a social conservative background and in resource-poor circumstances to benefit from a digital educational solution.",['Soehnchen C; Rietz A; Weirauch V; Meister S; Henningsen M'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37921860,a digital sexual health education app could support and provide education and information for universal equal access. the double diamond model was modeled to a self-expanded intercultural research model. the study targeted the requirements for establishing a reusable framework to develop a successful web-based sexual health education app.
Epidemiology of dysmenorrhea among secondary-school students in Northern Saudi Arabia.,"Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common and important health problems, especially among young girls. It results in absence from school and work. It has some negative effects on the daily activities of patients. Because of cultural problems, patients ordinarily do not seek help from others in this situation. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns during adolescence may permit early prevention of potential health concerns in adulthood. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, severity, and impact of dysmenorrhea in secondary-school students and its association with school absenteeism in Arar city. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in four secondary schools for girls in Arar city on 344 secondary school students during the academic year 2015-2016. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all participants; questions were related to menstruation, elucidating variations in menstrual patterns, history of dysmenorrheal, and absenteeism from school. All adolescent school girls completed the questionnaire (n=344). The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 74.4% (n=256) (mild=21.1%, moderate=41.4%, and severe=37.5%). Family history of dysmenorrhea was reported among 65.6% and fatigue was the most commonly associated symptom (79.7%) among dysmenorrheic girls. Limitation of activities was reported by the majority of participants with dysmenorrhea. Activities affected by dysmenorrhea included homework (78.9%), daily activities (75%), class concentration (71.9%), school attendance (59.4%), and academic performance (52.3%); about 50.8% reported social withdrawal due to dysmenorrhea. Eighteen percent consulted a school physician and 57.8% received herbal drinks to alleviate symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent among adolescent secondary-school girls and is associated with school absenteeism and limitations on social and academic activities. Given that most adolescents do not seek medical advice for dysmenorrhea, healthcare providers should screen routinely for dysmenorrhea and offer treatment. As dysmenorrhea reportedly affects school performance, school administrators may have a vested interest in providing health education on this topic to their students. Health education has to be supplemented by availability of other services such as consultation with school nurse and school physician and availability of drugs that alleviate pain.",['Abd El-Mawgod MM; Alshaibany AS; Al-Anazi AM'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749642,dysmenorrhea is one of the most common and important health problems. it results in absence from school and work. it has some negative effects on the daily activities of patients.
Thoracic endometriosis presented as catamental hemoptysis: a case series of a rare disease.,"Thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) is a rare disease in which a functioning endometrial tissue is observed in the pleura, lung, parenchyma, airways, and/or diaphragm. The optimal management of this disease remains a matter of debate. We aimed to report TES cases and their effective hormonal treatment and management. In this retrospective study, women presented as catamenial hemoptysis (CH) diagnosed with thoracic endometriosis were included. The main outcome of measure was cessation or recurrence of the clinical manifestations of thoracic endometriosis. The mean onset age of the 14 patients was 30.21 ± 5.40 years. CH was characteristic symptom of these patients. All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scan during menstruation and 2 or 3 weeks after menstruation, which showed the obvious shrinking or disappearance of the lesions. All of the patients were given Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) for 3 to 6 months, eleven of them were administered with combined oral contraceptives (COC) cyclically after GnRHa. The median follow-up duration was 24 months. Hemoptysis recurrence was observed in one patient. CH is a rare clinical entity of thoracic endometriosis, the change of CT images during and after menstruation or the response to GnRHa were helpful for accurate diagnosis. Hormonal treatment with GnRHa followed by COCs cyclically could be employed for efficient management of thoracic endometriosis.",['Dai Y; Li MH; Liu YJ; Liu B; Wu YS; Lang JH; Zhang ZY; Leng JH'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33538197,"TES is a rare disease in which a functioning endometrial tissue is observed in the pleura, lung, parenchyma, airways, and/or diaphragm. the optimal management of this disease remains a matter of debate."
"Hysteroscopy as a Therapeutic Tool: A Vision to Spare the Uterus in Premenopausal Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB)/Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB), an Update.","Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common cause of gynecological complaints in perimenopausal women. The treatment chosen by most of the women having HMB/AUB in the perimenopausal age group when medical therapy fails is hysterectomy, which unfortunately has significant issues related to safety and long-term quality of life apart from being a burden on the health care system and cost to patients. Minimal access surgical techniques like hysteroscopic targeted therapies are available which are conservative and spare the uterus and major surgery and its complications and sequelae. Hysteroscopic management of HMB is a minimally invasive and targeted approach in diagnosing and treating the pathological lesions causing the symptoms and not radical like hysterectomy which has more chances of occurrence of adverse events both intra and postoperatively. In terms of health-related quality of life, women suffering from HMB who underwent a hysteroscopic conservative approach had better scores when compared to those with hysterectomy.

"Tracking and modeling the movement of Queensland fruit flies, Bactrocera tryoni, using harmonic radar in papaya fields.","Determining movement parameters for pest insects such as tephritid fruit flies is critical to developing models which can be used to increase the effectiveness of surveillance and control strategies. In this study, harmonic radar was used to track wild-caught male Queensland fruit flies (Qflies), Bactrocera tryoni, in papaya fields. Experiment 1 continuously tracked single flies which were prodded to induce movement. Qfly movements from this experiment showed greater mean squared displacement than predicted by both a simple random walk (RW) or a correlated random walk (CRW) model, suggesting that movement parameters derived from the entire data set do not adequately describe the movement of individual Qfly at all spatial scales or for all behavioral states. This conclusion is supported by both fractal and hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis. Lower fractal dimensions (straighter movement paths) were observed at larger spatial scales (> 2.5 m) suggesting that Qflies have qualitatively distinct movement at different scales. Further, a two-state HMM fit the observed movement data better than the CRW or RW models. Experiment 2 identified individual landing locations, twice a day, for groups of released Qflies, demonstrating that flies could be tracked over longer periods of time.",['Hurst AL; O Brien AL; Miller ND; Peachey AMW; Yoder JM; De Faveri SG; Cheesman J; Manoukis NC; Siderhurst MS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080311,harmonic radar was used to track wild-caught male Queensland fruit flies. experiment 1 continuously tracked single flies which were prodded to induce movement.
Phenological responses of alpine snowbed communities to advancing snowmelt.,"Climate change is leading to advanced snowmelt date in alpine regions. Consequently, alpine plant species and ecosystems experience substantial changes due to prolonged phenological seasons, while the responses, mechanisms and implications remain widely unclear. In this 3-year study, we investigated the effects of advancing snowmelt on the phenology of alpine snowbed species. We related microclimatic drivers to species and ecosystem phenology using <i>in situ</i> monitoring and phenocams. We further used predictive modelling to determine whether early snowmelt sites could be used as sentinels for future conditions. Temperature during the snow-free period primarily influenced flowering phenology, followed by snowmelt timing. <i>Salix herbacea</i> and <i>Gnaphalium supinum</i> showed the most opportunistic phenology, while annual <i>Euphrasia minima</i> struggled to complete its phenology in short growing seasons. Phenological responses varied more between years than sites, indicating potential local long-term adaptations and suggesting these species' potential to track future earlier melting dates. Phenocams captured ecosystem-level phenology (start, peak and end of phenological season) but failed to explain species-level variance. Our findings highlight species-specific responses to advancing snowmelt, with snowbed species responding highly opportunistically to changes in snowmelt timings while following species-specific developmental programs. While species from surrounding grasslands may benefit from extended growing seasons, snowbed species may become outcompeted due to internal-clock-driven, non-opportunistic senescence, despite displaying a high level of phenological plasticity.",['Crepaz H; Quaglia E; Lombardi G; Lonati M; Rossi M; Ravetto Enri S; Dullinger S; Tappeiner U; Niedrist G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39005886,climate change is leading to advanced snowmelt date in alpine regions. phenology of alpine plant species and ecosystems is investigated.
The prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterised by symptoms confined to the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. Confirmed diagnosis requires prospective monitoring of symptoms over two cycles, otherwise the diagnosis is provisional. We aimed to measure the point prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. We searched for studies of prevalence using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and PubMed. For each study, the total sample size and number of cases were extracted. The prevalence across studies was calculated using random effects meta-analysis with a generalised linear mixed model. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Pre-registration was with PROSPERO (CRD42021249249). 44 studies with 48 independent samples met inclusion criteria, consisting of 50,659 participants. The pooled prevalence was 3.2 % (95 % confidence intervals: 1.7 %-5.9 %) for confirmed and 7.7 % (95 % confidence intervals: 5.3 %-11.0 %) for provisional diagnosis. There was high heterogeneity across all studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 99 %). Sources of heterogeneity identified by meta-regression were continent of sample (p < 0.0001), type of sample (community-based, university, high school) (p = 0.007), risk of bias (p = 0.009), and method of diagnosis (p = 0.017). Restricting the analysis to community-based samples using confirmed diagnosis resulted in a prevalence of 1.6 % (95 % confidence intervals: 1.0 %-2.5 %), with low heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 26 %). A small number of included studies used full DSM criteria in community settings. The point prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder using confirmed diagnosis is lower compared with provisional diagnosis. Studies relying on provisional diagnosis are likely to produce artificially high prevalence rates.",['Reilly TJ; Patel S; Unachukwu IC; Knox CL; Wilson CA; Craig MC; Schmalenberger KM; Eisenlohr-Moul TA; Cullen AE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38199397,prevalence was calculated using random effects meta-analysis. prevalence was 3.2 % (95 % confidence intervals: 1.7 %-5.9 %) for confirmed.
"Cyclic processes in the uterine tubes, endometrium, myometrium, and cervix: pathways and perturbations.","This review leads the 2023 Call for Papers in MHR: 'Cyclical function of the female reproductive tract' and will outline the complex and fascinating changes that take place in the reproductive tract during the menstrual cycle. We will also explore associated reproductive tract abnormalities that impact or are impacted by the menstrual cycle. Between menarche and menopause, women and people who menstruate living in high-income countries can expect to experience ∼450 menstrual cycles. The primary function of the menstrual cycle is to prepare the reproductive system for pregnancy in the event of fertilization. In the absence of pregnancy, ovarian hormone levels fall, triggering the end of the menstrual cycle and onset of menstruation. We have chosen to exclude the ovaries and focus on the other structures that make up the reproductive tract: uterine tubes, endometrium, myometrium, and cervix, which also functionally change in response to fluctuations in ovarian hormone production across the menstrual cycle. This inaugural paper for the 2023 MHR special collection will discuss our current understanding of the normal physiological processes involved in uterine cyclicity (limited specifically to the uterine tubes, endometrium, myometrium, and cervix) in humans, and other mammals where relevant. We will emphasize where knowledge gaps exist and highlight the impact that reproductive tract and uterine cycle perturbations have on health and fertility.",['Holdsworth-Carson SJ; Menkhorst E; Maybin JA; King A; Girling JE'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37225518,this review leads the 2023 call for Papers in MHR: 'Cyclical function of the female reproductive tract' we will also explore associated reproductive tract abnormalities that impact or are affected by the menstrual cycle.
One-day surgery is safe and effective in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A prospective comparative study at 1 year of follow-up.,"To compare the outcomes and complications of two perioperative protocols for the management of patients who underwent medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA): 24 h (1-day surgery [OS]) versus 72 h (enhanced recovery after surgery [ERAS]) of the length of hospital stay (LOS). In our hypothesis, the reduction of the LOS from 3 to 1 day did not influence the outcomes and complications. A total of 42 patients (21 in each group) with isolated anteromedial knee osteoarthritis and meeting specific criteria were prospectively included in the study. Clinical outcomes included Knee Society Score (KSS) and Forgotten joint score while pain evaluation was performed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Functional outcomes were assessed measuring the knee range of motion (ROM) while radiographic outcomes were evaluated measuring the amelioration of the varus deformity through the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA). Clinical and functional outcomes did not significantly differ between the two groups. Complications occurred in 9.5% of OS and 4.7% of ERAS group patients. Significant improvements in knee ROM, VAS pain, KSS and HKA angle were observed postsurgery, with no significant differences between groups except in KSS expectations and function trends. The OS protocol is safe and effective and LOS, in a well-defined fast-track protocol, did not significantly impact clinical and functional outcomes. OS may lead to reduced hospitalisation costs and potential reductions in complications associated with prolonged stays, benefiting both patients and healthcare facilities. However, further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these findings. Early mobilisation and rehabilitation protocols are key components of successful patient recovery following UKA procedures.

Self-Reported Menstrual Alterations During the COVID-19 Syndemic in Spain: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Available evidence suggests that there might be an association between the stressors experienced during the COVID-19 syndemic and changes in menstrual patterns. The aim of this study was to assess self-reported menstrual alterations during the COVID-19 syndemic among women and people who menstruate aged 18-55 in Spain. A cross-sectional online survey-based study was conducted (March-July 2021). Descriptive statistics were calculated and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed. This study was conducted as part of the ""Equity and Menstrual Health in Spain"" research project. Among participants (N=17,455), 39.4% reported menstrual alterations since the start of the syndemic. Participants self-reporting long COVID-19 presented higher odds of menstrual alterations (aOR: 1.34, 95% CI, 1.15-1.57). In participants with no history of COVID-19, the risk for self-reported menstrual alterations was significantly higher based on employment situation, among participants experiencing financial issues (eg, financial issues always/many times <12 months: aOR: 1.68, 95% CI, 1.48-1.90), poorer self-perceived health (eg, poor: aOR: 2.00, 95% CI, 1.31-3.07), and those diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (aOR: 1.13, 95% CI, 1.02-1.26). Among participants with a self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, factors that significantly increased the odds for menstrual alterations were experiencing financial strains (eg, financial issues always/many times <12 months: aOR: 1.53, 95% CI, 1.09-2.14), poorer self-perceived health (eg, poor: aOR: 3.09, 95% CI, 1.01-9.52). Overall, factors that decreased the odds of reporting menstrual alterations included age >25, being a carer, not having a gynecological condition and using hormonal contraception. Findings suggest an impact of the COVID-19 syndemic on menstrual patterns. Social inequities in reporting menstrual alterations were identified. While the risk of reporting menstrual alterations was higher among participants with long COVID-19, evidence is not conclusive. Further research on menstrual health in the context of COVID-19 is needed, also to inform policy and practice.",['Medina-Perucha L; López-Jiménez T; Holst AS; Jacques-Aviñó C; Munrós-Feliu J; Martínez-Bueno C; Valls-Llobet C; Pinzón-Sanabria D; Vicente-Hernández MM; Berenguera A'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35444473,"self-reported menstrual alterations during the COVID-19 syndemic in Spain. study was conducted as part of the ""equity and menstrual health in Spain"" research project."
"U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2024.","The 2024 U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (U.S. SPR) addresses a selected group of common, yet sometimes complex, issues regarding initiation and use of specific contraceptive methods.

Is criminalization the answer? Perspectives of community members and police on menstrual seclusion policy in Far-West Nepal.,"Chhaupadi is a form of menstrual seclusion practiced in Nepal in which women and girls are isolated during their menstrual cycles and follow numerous restrictions. The tradition dates back centuries and can have serious physical and mental health consequences. While the practice was criminalized in 2017 with fines and jail time, this legislative action comes after more than a decade of legal history, from an initial ban in 2006, to declaring it a form of violence against women in 2009, and finally, its criminalization in 2017. Exploring levels of awareness regarding the 2017 chhaupadi criminalization, perceptions of the legal penalties, and whether or not criminalization will lead to behaviour change are imperative next steps for informing the development of evidence-based interventions targeting chhaupadi. In this qualitative investigation conducted in Kalikot district, six focus group discussions and 33 in-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 81 participants. School-going girls, girls who have dropped out of school before completing twelfth grade, mothers, fathers, teachers, health care providers, religious leaders, traditional healers, grandmothers and police participated in the study. The results indicate that criminalization is generally perceived as a positive step for initiating chhaupadi behaviour change, and one-third of participants expressed that they plan to change their behaviours after learning that chhaupadi is publishable with fines and/or jail time. However, accurate information about the criminal code is extremely low and therefore interventions ensuring communities and law enforcement are informed of the criminalization and associated penalties are urgently needed. In addition, even after its criminalization, chhaupadi behaviour change is anticipated to be gradual and is expected to require long-term interventions targeting social pressure associated with upholding the tradition and raising awareness via appropriate trainings, engaging the media, and beyond.",['Baumann SE; Merante MM; Wiltrout CT; Cutlip T; Finkel M; Maharjan B; Lhaki P; Burke JG'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051090,chhaupadi is a form of menstrual seclusion practiced in far-west Nepal. it is a form of menstrual seclusion practiced in the country. the practice dates back centuries and can have serious physical and mental health consequences.
"Depression, anxiety and self-esteem in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome.","Objective of the study was to evaluate the depression, anxiety and perceived stress level in adolescent girls with diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as to assess their body and self-esteem and its impact on emotional status. In 27 adolescent girls with confirmed diagnosis of PCOS (study group) as well as 27 healthy, regularly menstruating, age and BMI matched girls (control group) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Body-Esteem Scale (BES) containing three subscales (sexual attractiveness, weight concern, physical condition) were performed. There were no significant differences between PCOS group and control group in depression and PSS-10 scores, but the anxiety score was significantly higher in control than in PCOS group (9.6 ± 3.0 vs 7.3 ± 3.9, p = 0.02). Moreover, in BES subscales' scores there were no significant differences between the groups, whereas RSES score was significantly higher in PCOS group (25.0 ± 7.1 vs 28.3 ± 4.6, p = 0.04). In PCOS group anxiety score was related to PSS-10 score (r = 0.56, p = 0.005). Moreover, we found that obesity was negatively related to anxiety (rƴ = -0.4, p = 0.04), depression (rƴ = -0.48, p = 0.02), PSS-10 (rƴ = -0.59, p = 0.004) and physical condition scores (rƴ = -0.44, p = 0.04).

Abnormal uterine bleeding: The well-known and the hidden face.,"Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in regularity, volume, frequency or duration. It encompasses heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding and intermenstrual bleeding, which are common symptoms among women of reproductive age, impacting their overall well-being. Menstruation involves interactions between endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, immune cell influx, and changes in endometrial vasculature. These events resemble an inflammatory response with increased vessel permeability, tissue breakdown, and the arrival of innate immune cells. However, the mechanisms of menstrual cessation are poorly understood. AUB can be related to structural causes (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy/hyperplasia) and nonstructural conditions (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic). While transvaginal ultrasound is the primary method for the screening of intracavitary lesions, saline infusion sonohysterography is more accurate to detect endometrial polyps and submucous leiomyomas, while hysteroscopy with biopsy remains the reference method for a definitive diagnosis. The main goals in managing AUB are addressing and correcting the underlying primary cause, if possible, and establishing a regular bleeding pattern or amenorrhea, which can be done with antifibrinolytic agents, progestins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists, or surgical interventions, each one with specific indications and limitations. Further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness and the long-term effects of various medical and surgical treatments. Meanwhile, the availability of diagnostic methods such as transvaginal ultrasound and hysteroscopy and the universal distribution of medical treatments for AUB should be prioritized by policymakers to minimize the diagnostic and treatment delay and thus reduce the risk of AUB-related anemia and the need of hysterectomy.",['Leal CRV; Vannuccini S; Jain V; Dolmans MM; Di Spiezio Sardo A; Al-Hendy A; Reis FM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38764520,"menstruation involves interactions between endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, immune cell influx, and changes in endometrial vasculature. menstruation involves interactions between endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, changes in endometrial vasculature."
Reproductive Issues in Patients With the Fontan Operation.,"Patients with the Fontan operation have a unique circulation, with a limited ability to increase cardiac output, and high central venous pressure. They may have diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, thromboembolic complications, or multiorgan dysfunction. All of these factors contribute to reproductive issues, including menstrual irregularities, infertility, recurrent miscarriage, and complications during pregnancy. Although atrial arrhythmias are the most common cardiac complications during pregnancy, patients can develop heart failure and thromboembolic events. Obstetric bleeding, including postpartum hemorrhage, is common. In addition to maternal complications, adverse fetal and neonatal events, such as prematurity and low birthweight, are very common. Counselling about these reproductive issues should begin early. For those who become pregnant, care should be provided by a multidisciplinary cardio-obstetric team familiar with the specific issues and needs of the Fontan population. In this review, we discuss infertility, contraception, and pregnancy in patients with the Fontan operation.","[""Wichert-Schmitt B; D'Souza R; Silversides CK""]",2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35490924,patients with the Fontan operation have a unique circulation. they may have diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction. atrial arrhythmias are the most common cardiac complications during pregnancy.
"""For men, by men"": Menstrual victimization and the weaponization of period products in carceral settings.","The literature on menstruation defines period poverty as the inability to access sufficient period products, education, and sanitary facilities needed to manage menstruation healthily and effectively. While research has identified shortcomings of healthcare in the carceral setting, period poverty behind bars has remained largely absent from criminal legal discourse. The current study examines the interplay of period poverty and carceral control to introduce the novel concept of menstrual victimization, defined as the physical, emotional, and financial victimization that results from period poverty perpetuated through carceral control. The study uses qualitative content analysis to systematically gather and code journalistic accounts pertaining to the menstrual experiences of incarcerated and previously incarcerated females, criminal justice practitioners, and journalists. The analysis uses literary pieces (<i>n</i> = 99), which were coded deductively and guided by concepts related to structural violence and radical feminist criminology. The findings shed light on the unique structural harms incarcerated menstruators face and reveal the dearth of needed empirical research on period poverty in carceral spaces. The narratives in the sample revealed how manufactured scarcity of period products within carceral spaces is used as a means of oppression by institutional agents. The emergent themes highlight how the intersection of period poverty and carceral control led to menstrual victimization characterized through shame, humiliation, control, and coercion. Potential outcomes associated with understanding menstrual victimization in the carceral setting are discussed, including reducing menstrual stigma, disseminating health education, minimizing health disparities, and ultimately, shifting modes of holding accountability away from oppressive, retributive, and controlling tactics.",['Tapp K; Henson A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38554068,literature defines period poverty as inability to access sufficient period products. period poverty behind bars has remained absent from criminal legal discourse. study uses qualitative content analysis to code journalistic accounts.
Application of RiTiCE in understanding hydro-meteorological controls on ice break-up patterns in River Tornionjoki.,"The Arctic region experiences significant annual hydrologic events, with the spring flood and ice break-up being the most prominent. River ice break-up, in particular, poses high socioeconomic and ecological expenses, including morphological changes and damage to riverine structures. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of river ice in the River Tornionjoki, including the timing of ice break-up at different latitudes. We utilized observation data and remote sensing techniques to track changes in ice patterns overtime on the River Tornionjoki. The study indicates that the ice break-up in the River Tornionjoki basin typically occurs during Apr-Jun based on the reach location in different latitudes; therefore, different stations behave according to their latitudinal location. We observed significant spatial variations in ice break-up timing across the basin, with an earlier break-up in the lower latitudes compared to the upper latitudes. The average ice break-up day in lower latitude stations ranges between 200-205, while in higher latitude stations the average ice break-up day ranges between 215-228.",['Shahrood AJ; Ahrari A; Karjalainen N; Klöve B; Haghighi AT'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066901,river ice break-up poses high socioeconomic and ecological expenses. the study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of river ice in the river Tornionjoki.
Examining differences in menstrual and intimate care product use by race/ethnicity and education among menstruating individuals.,"United States consumers spend over two billion dollars a year on intimate care products. These products, along with scented menstrual products, are marketed for odor control, perceived ""freshness,"" and vaginal/vulvar cleanliness. However, these scent-altering products may increase exposure to carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Prior research has not adequately characterized demographic differences in product use. The objective of our study is to examine racial/ethnic and educational differences in menstrual and intimate care product use among people who menstruate. We pooled data from two US-based cross sectional studies to examine demographic characteristics and product use in 661 participants aged 18-54 years. Participants reported use of scented and unscented menstrual products (tampons, sanitary pads, and menstrual cups) and intimate care products (vaginal douches, sprays, wipes, and powders). We examined differences by race/ethnicity and education using log-binomial regression and latent class analysis (LCA), which can identify groups based on product use patterns. Our sample was 33.4% Black, 30.9% Latina, 18.2% White, and 16.2% another identity. Approximately half the population had a bachelor's degree or more; 1.4% identified as transgender and 1.8% as non-binary. In adjusted models, scent-altering products (i.e., scented menstrual and intimate care products) were more likely to be used by those with less formal education (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Unscented menstrual products were more likely to be used by those with more formal education. Compared to Black participants, White participants were more likely to use unscented tampons and menstrual cups and less likely to use douches and wipes (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Using LCA we identified two groups: one more likely to use scent-altering products, and a second more likely to use unscented menstrual products. Less education and older age, but not race/ethnicity, was significantly associated with membership in the group more likely to use scent-altering products. While sex/gender composition did not statistically vary across groups, all non-binary participants fell in the unscented menstrual product group. Lower educational attainment was consistently associated with greater use of scent-altering menstrual and intimate care products. Future research should examine associations between body odor stigma, product use, and health risks at intersections of race, class, and gender.",['Zota AR; Franklin ET; Weaver EB; Shamasunder B; Williams A; Siegel EL; Dodson RE'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38126001,study: racial/ethnic and educational differences in menstrual and intimate care product use among menstruating individuals. study examined differences by race/ethnicity and education. half the population had a bachelor's degree or more; 1.4% identified as transgender.
"Relationship between sensitive skin and sleep disorders, fatigue, dust, sweating, food, tobacco consumption or female hormonal changes: Results from a worldwide survey of 10 743 individuals.","Sensitive skin is related to environmental factors. We aimed to investigate the roles of poorly known associated and triggering factors on sensitive skin in a large global population. A survey was administrated to a representative sample of the adult population aged 18-75 years in five different countries (Brazil, China, France Russia, and the United States). All participants answered a web-based questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, sensitive skin and environmental factors. Among the 10 743 included individuals (5285 men and 5458 women), 48.2% declared that they had sensitive skin. The group with sensitive skin reported significant increases in fatigue, dust or sweating and to a lesser extent food or tobacco consumption. The members of this group also declared that they experienced more sleep disorders than individuals without sensitive skin. Sensitive skin was very frequent in pregnant women, women with painful menstruations or women using contraceptive pills. This large cohort study identified new factors, including female hormonal status, fatigue, sleep disorders and food, associated with sensitive skin. These associations suggest that sensitive skin is not restricted to an epidermal disorder but may be included in a larger context.

Melatonin for premenstrual syndrome: A potential remedy but not ready.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a recurrent and moderate disorder that occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and quickly resolves after menstruation, is characterized by somatic and emotional discomfort that can be severe enough to impair daily activities. Current therapeutic drugs for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not very satisfying. As a critical pineal hormone, melatonin has increasingly been suggested to modulate PMS symptoms. In this review, we update the latest progress on PMS-induced sleep disturbance, mood changes, and cognitive impairment and provide possible pathways by which melatonin attenuates these symptoms. Moreover, we focus on the role of melatonin in PMS molecular mechanisms. Herein, we show that melatonin can regulate ovarian estrogen and progesterone, of which cyclic fluctuations contribute to PMS pathogenesis. Melatonin also modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor system in PMS. Interpreting the role of melatonin in PMS is not only informative to clarify PMS etiology but also instructive to melatonin and its receptor agonist application to promote female health. As a safe interaction, melatonin treatment can be effective in alleviating symptoms of PMS. However, symptoms such as sleep disturbance, depressive mood, cognitive impairment are not specific and can be easily misdiagnosed. Connections between melatonin receptor, ovarian steroid dysfunction, and PMS are not consistent among past studies. Before final conclusions are drawn, more well-organized and rigorous studies are recommended.",['Yin W; Zhang J; Guo Y; Wu Z; Diao C; Sun J'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36699021,"melatonin is a potential remedy but not ready for premenstrual syndrome. symptoms such as sleep disturbance, depressive mood, cognitive impairment are not specific. melatonin can regulate ovarian estrogen and progesterone."
Weight Changes and Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors Are Associated With Dysmenorrhea in Young Women.,"This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and to investigate the effect of weight changes or unhealthy weight control behaviors on dysmenorrhea in young Korean women. We used large-scale data of women, aged 14 to 44 years, who participated in the Korean Study of Women's Health-Related Issues. Dysmenorrhea was measured using a visual analog scale and was categorized as none, mild, moderate, and severe according to the severity. Weight changes and unhealthy weight control behaviors (any of the behaviors, fasting/meal skipping, drugs, the use of unapproved dietary supplements, and one-food diets) over the past year were self-reported. We used multinomial logistic regression to investigate the association between weight changes or unhealthy weight control behaviors and dysmenorrhea. Of the 5,829 young women participating in the study, 5,245 (90.0%) participants experienced dysmenorrhea [2,184 (37.5%) had moderate and 1,358 (23.3%) had severe]. After adjusting for confounders, the odds ratios for moderate and severe dysmenorrhea in participants with weight changes ≥ 3 kg (vs. < 3 kg) were 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.35) and 1.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.45), respectively. The odds ratios in participants with any unhealthy weight control behaviors were 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.42) and 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.67) for those with moderate and severe dysmenorrhea, respectively. Weight changes (≥ 3 kg) or unhealthy weight control behaviors are common among young women, which may adversely affect dysmenorrhea. Therefore, attention needs to be paid to excessive weight changes and unhealthy weight control behaviors to improve dysmenorrhea in young women.",['Han K; Lim NK; Choi H; Song BM; Park HY'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37158772,weight changes and unhealthy weight control behaviors are a factor in dysmenorrhea. the study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in young women.
Acceptability of menstrual products interventions for menstrual hygiene management among women and girls in Malawi.,"A key challenge for menstruating girls and women in low-resource countries is the inadequate and unreliable supply of menstrual products. Although development partners are implementing menstrual product interventions to address this challenge in Malawi, there is a paucity of information on the distribution of menstrual products and the acceptability of these interventions among users. We conducted in-depth interviews with girls (n = 20) and women (n = 26) and 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) with women (n = 35) and 7 FGDs with girls (n = 60) to explore the acceptability of menstrual products interventions in 8 districts. Teachers (n = 12), community leaders (n = 6), community health workers (n = 8) and service providers (n = 9) were also interviewed to explore implementation issues and their views regarding the effect of menstrual products interventions on girls and women. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Common menstrual products being promoted include locally made reusable pads, commercially made disposable pads and menstrual cups. Overall, adult women preferred reusable pads and young girls preferred disposable pads. Reported benefits of using any type of material distributed included enhanced cleanliness and reduced school absenteeism for girls. While community leaders and teachers applauded the use of disposable menstrual products they expressed concern that they are not affordable for an average Malawian and bemoaned the indiscriminate disposal of used disposable pads. Women and girls highlighted their lack of facilities to effectively wash and dry reusable pads. Service providers bemoaned poor coordination and the lack of national standards to regulate the quality of menstrual products distributed at national level. Improved inclusion of males and health workers could enhance the sustainability of programmes. While the available menstrual products interventions are acceptable among participants, we note several challenges including affordability, poor disposal methods, lack of attention on sanitation facilities and the lack of standard protocols to regulate the quality of menstrual products.

First, 239 fecal samples from individuals across four regions of China revealed a bimodal distribution, highlighting the abundance and variability in <i>Prevotella</i> spp. within the Chinese population. Second, the longitudinal cohort study included 184 fecal samples from 52 time points collected from seven individuals who demonstrated either the outbreaks or disappearances of <i>Prevotella</i> spp., emphasizing the transient nature of <i>Prevotella</i> abundance levels and suggesting shifts in <i>Prevotella</i> ""enterotypes."" Furthermore, a turnover of the dominant <i>Prevotella</i> spp. was observed, indicating the potential presence of diverse subtypes of <i>Prevotella</i> enterotype. Notably, the genomic analysis demonstrated the persistence of specific <i>Prevotella</i> strains within individuals over extended periods, highlighting the enduring presence of <i>Prevotella</i> in the human gut. In conclusion, by integrating the temporal and geographical scales in our research, we gained deeper insights into the dynamics of <i>Prevotella</i>, emphasizing the importance of considering the dynamics at the time and species level in gut microbiota studies and their implications on human health.",['Han N; Peng X; Zhang T; Qiang Y; Li X; Zhang W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044948,"i>Prevotella/i> spp. in the human gut microbiota was investigated. a turnover of the dominant i>Prevotella/i> spp. was observed. the concept of ""enterotypes"" in microbiome research has attracted substantial interest."
"Systematic review of menstrual hygiene management requirements, its barriers and strategies for disabled people.","One quarter of the global population is of menstruating age, yet menstruation is shrouded in discrimination and taboos. Disability also carries stigma, so disabled people may face layers of discrimination when they are menstruating. The objective of the review is to assess the menstrual hygiene requirements of disabled people, the barriers they face, and the available interventions to help them manage their menstruation hygienically and with dignity. Eligible studies, gathered across all countries, were identified by conducting searches across four databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health) in May 2017, with alerts set on each database to highlight new titles added until April 2018. Eligible studies incorporated analyses relevant to menstruating disabled people and/or how their carers provide support during their menstrual cycle. The 22 studies included were published since 1976; the majority after 2010 (n = 12; 55%). One study was a quasi-experiment; all others were observational. Most studies (n = 15; 68%) were from high income countries and most (n = 17; 77%) focused on people with intellectual impairments, so the review findings focus on this group and their carers. Outcomes investigated include choice and preference of menstrual product, ability to manage menstrual hygiene and coping strategies applied. Barriers faced included a lack of standardised guidance for professional carers; a lack of menstruation training, information and support provided to people with intellectual impairments and their carers; a lack of understanding of severity of symptoms experienced by people with intellectual impairments, the high cost of menstrual products and lack of appropriate options for people with physical impairments. Few interventions were found, and strategies for menstrual hygiene management applied by carers of persons with intellectual impairments include limiting the disabled person's movements when menstruating and suppressing their menstruation. Little evidence was identified on the requirements of disabled people and their carers in managing their menstruation, and only one intervention, but a range of barriers were identified. This gap in evidence is important, as the consequences of failing to meet menstrual hygiene needs of disabled people includes shame, social isolation, and even sterilisation.

Adaptations to a patient navigation program for follow-up colonoscopy in rural primary care practices.,"Patient navigation is a recommended practice to improve cancer screenings among underserved populations including those residing in rural areas with care access barriers. We report on patient navigation programme adaptations to increase follow-up colonoscopy rates after abnormal fecal testing in rural primary care practices. Participating clinics delivered a patient navigation programme to eligible patients from 28 affiliated clinics serving rural communities in Oregon clustered within 3 Medicaid health plans. Patient navigation adaptations were tracked using data sources including patient navigation training programme reflections, qualitative interviews, clinic meetings, and periodic reflections with practice facilitators. Initial, planned (proactive) adaptations were made to address the rural context; later, unplanned (reactive) adaptations were implemented to address the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Initial planned adaptations to the patient navigation programme were made before the main trial to address the needs of the rural context, including provider shortages and geographic dispersion limiting both patient access to care and training opportunities for providers. Later unplanned adaptations were made primarily in response to COVID-19 care suspension and staff redeployments and shortages that occurred during implementation. While unplanned adaptations were implemented to address the contextual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care access patterns and staffing, the changes to training content and context were beneficial to the rural setting overall and should be sustained. Our findings can guide future efforts to optimise the success of such programmes in other rural settings and highlight the important role of adaptations in implementation projects.",['Thompson JH; Rivelli JS; Schneider JL; Kenzie ES; Myers E; Coury J; Davis M; Gautom P; Coronado GD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38935862,patient navigation is a recommended practice to improve cancer screenings. participants delivered a patient navigation programme to eligible patients. participants from 28 affiliated clinics serving rural communities in Oregon clustered within 3 Medicaid health plans.
Nutritional Risks among Adolescent Athletes with Disordered Eating.,"In their attempt to achieve the optimum weight or body shape for their activity, athletes frequently use harmful weight-control practices that may lead to the development of disordered eating or eating disorders. These practices are linked to several medical and mental consequences that may be more serious in adolescent athletes, as their bodies must meet both intensive growth demands and training requirements at the same time. Among other consequences, adolescent athletes may be at nutritional risk, due to their high nutrient needs and unhealthy eating behaviors. A literature review was conducted to examine the main nutritional risks and malnutrition issues faced by adolescent athletes that present disordered eating attitudes or eating disorders. Most studies refer to adult elite athletes, however research on adolescent athletes also indicates that the most common nutritional risks that may arise due to disordered eating include energy, macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances and changes in body composition that may lead to menstrual abnormalities, and decreased bone mass density. Educational programs and early detection of disordered eating and eating disorders are crucial to avoid the emergence and ensure timely management of nutrition-related problems in the vulnerable group of adolescent athletes.",['Kontele I; Vassilakou T'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34438606,adolescent athletes often use harmful weight-control practices. these practices may lead to the development of disordered eating or eating disorders. a literature review was conducted to examine the main nutritional risks and malnutrition issues faced by adolescent athletes.
A health decision analytical model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of female genital schistosomiasis screening strategies: The female genital schistosomiasis SCREEN framework.,"Female genital schistosomiasis is a chronic gynaecological disease caused by the waterborne parasite Schistosoma (S.) haematobium. It affects an estimated 30-56 million girls and women globally, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa where it is endemic, and negatively impacts their sexual and reproductive life. Recent studies found evidence of an association between female genital schistosomiasis and increased prevalence of HIV and cervical precancer lesions. Despite the large population at risk, the burden and impact of female genital schistosomiasis are scarcely documented, resulting in neglect and insufficient resource allocation. There is currently no standardised method for individual or population-based female genital schistosomiasis screening and diagnosis which hinders accurate assessment of disease burden in endemic countries. To optimise financial allocations for female genital schistosomiasis screening, it is necessary to explore the cost-effectiveness of different strategies by combining cost and impact estimates. Yet, no economic evaluation has explored the value for money of alternative screening methods. This paper describes a novel application of health decision analytical modelling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different female genital schistosomiasis screening strategies across endemic settings. The model combines a decision tree for female genital schistosomiasis screening strategies, and a Markov model for the natural history of cervical cancer to estimate the cost per disability-adjusted life-years averted for different screening strategies, stratified by HIV status. It is a starting point for discussion and for supporting priority setting in a data-sparse environment.",['Lamberti O; Terris-Prestholt F; Bustinduy AL; Bozzani F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39095942,"female genital schistosomiasis is a chronic gynaecological disease caused by the waterborne parasite Schistosoma (S.) haematobium. it affects an estimated 30-56 million girls and women globally, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa where it is endemic."
Maternal exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol impairs female offspring glucose homeostasis and endocrine pancreatic development in the rat.,"Recent reports indicate that 7% of pregnant mothers in North America use cannabis. This is concerning given that in utero exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, causes fetal growth restriction and may alter replication and survival of pancreatic β-cells in the offspring. Accordingly, we hypothesized that maternal exposure to Δ9-THC during pregnancy would impair postnatal glucometabolic health of offspring. To test this hypothesis, pregnant Wistar rats were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of either 3 mg/kg Δ9-THC or vehicle from gestational day 6 to birth. Offspring were subsequently challenged with glucose and insulin at 5 months of age to assess glucose tolerance and peripheral muscle insulin sensitivity. Female offspring exposed to Δ9-THC in utero were glucose intolerant, associated with blunted insulin response in muscle and increased serum insulin concentration 15 min after glucose challenge. Additionally, pancreata from male and female offspring were harvested at postnatal day 21 and 5 months of age for assessment of endocrine pancreas morphometry by immunostaining. This analysis revealed that gestational exposure to Δ9-THC reduced the density of islets in female, but not male, offspring at postnatal day 21 and 5 months, culminating in reduced β-cell mass at 5 months. These results demonstrate that fetal exposure to Δ9-THC causes female-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis, raising concern regarding the metabolic health of offspring, particularly females, exposed to cannabis in utero.",['Gillies R; Lee K; Vanin S; Laviolette SR; Holloway AC; Arany E; Hardy DB'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32325173,pregnant women in north americans use cannabis. 7% of pregnant mothers in north american use cannabis. 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC) causes fetal growth restriction.
A site-wise reliability analysis of the ABCD diffusion fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness: impact of scanner platforms.,"The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) project is the largest study of adolescent brain development. ABCD longitudinally tracks 11,868 participants aged 9-10 years from 21 sites using standardized protocols for multi-site MRI data collection and analysis. While the multi-site and multi-scanner study design enhances the robustness and generalizability of analysis results, it may also introduce non-biological variances including scanner-related variations, subject motion, and deviations from protocols. ABCD imaging data were collected biennially within a period of ongoing maturation in cortical thickness and integrity of cerebral white matter. These changes can bias the classical test-retest methodologies, such as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We developed a site-wise adaptive ICC (AICC) to evaluate the reliability of imaging-derived phenotypes while accounting for ongoing brain development. AICC iteratively estimates the population-level age-related brain development trajectory using a weighted mixed model and updates age-corrected site-wise reliability until convergence. We evaluated the test-retest reliability of regional fractional anisotropy (FA) measures from diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness (CT) from structural MRI data for each site. The mean AICC for 20 FA tracts across sites was 0.61±0.19, lower than the mean AICC for CT in 34 regions across sites, 0.76±0.12. Remarkably, sites using Siemens scanners consistently showed significantly higher AICC values compared to those using GE/Philips scanners for both FA (AICC=0.71±0.12 vs 0.46±0.17, p<0.001) and CT (AICC=0.80±0.10 vs 0.69±0.11, p<0.001). These findings demonstrate site-and-scanner related variations in data quality and underscore the necessity for meticulous data curation in subsequent association analyses.",['Pan Y; Hong LE; Acheson A; Thompson PM; Jahanshad N; Zhu AH; Yu J; Chen C; Ma T; Liu HL; Veraart J; Fieremans E; Karcher NR; Kochunov P; Chen S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38915669,"the adolescent brain and cognitive development project tracks 11,868 participants aged 9-10 years from 21 sites. the multi-site and multi-scanner study design enhances the robustness and generalizability of analysis results."
Nailing it: Investigation of elephant toenails for retrospective analysis of adrenal and reproductive hormones.,"Hormone monitoring of at-risk species can be valuable for evaluation of individual physiological status. Traditional non-invasive endocrine monitoring from urine and faeces typically captures only a short window in time, poorly reflecting long-term hormone fluctuations. We examined toenail trimmings collected from African (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) and Asian (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) elephants during routine foot care, to determine if long-term hormone patterns are preserved in these slow-growing keratinized tissues. We first measured the growth rate of elephant toenails biweekly for one year, to establish the temporal delay between deposition of hormones into nail tissue (at the proximal nail bed) and collection of toenail trimmings months later (at the distal tip of the nail). In African elephants, toenails grew ~0.18 ± 0.015 mm/day (mean ± SEM) and in Asian elephants, toenails grew ~0.24 ± 0.034 mm/day. This slow growth rate, combined with the large toenail size of elephants, may mean that toenails could contain a 'hormone timeline' of over a year between the nail bed and nail tip. Progesterone, testosterone and cortisol were readily detectable using commercial enzyme immunoassays, and all assays passed validations, indicating that these hormones can be accurately quantified in elephant toenail extract. In most cases, variations in hormone concentrations reflected expected physiological patterns for adult females and males (e.g. ovarian cycling and musth) and matched individual health records from participating zoos. Progesterone patterns aligned with our calculations of temporal delay, aligning with female ovarian cycling from over six months prior. Unexpectedly, male testosterone patterns aligned with current musth status at the time of sample collection (i.e. rather than prior musth status). Though this sample type will require further study, these results indicate that preserved hormone patterns in elephant toenails could give conservationists a new tool to aid management of elephant populations.",['Rich G; Stennett R; Galloway M; McClure M; Riley R; Freeman EW; Hunt KE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100510,toenails grew 0.18  0.015 mm/day in african elephants. endocrine monitoring from urine and faeces typically captures only a short window in time.
Bouncing back: a longitudinal examination of challenge within football academy environments.,"Although substantial research indicates that challenge plays a big role in the development of talent, little is known of the experiences of young performers as they negotiate and learn from these challenges. As such, to better understand the nature and impact of challenge on the Talent Development (TD) pathway, we longitudinally tracked nine young footballers from progressive age-bands (five aged 11 years and four aged 14) as they experienced challenge over a 15-month period using a mixed-methods design. Five semi-structured interviews separated by three months were conducted, and data were analysed via thematic analysis. Our findings suggested that participants encountered recurrent challenging events, categorised into common/uncommon, planned/unplanned, individual-focused/group-focused challenges. Support for the benefits of challenges was pervasive throughout the data with participants progressing through stages with each challenge (drop, rebound and growth). However, the magnitude and rate at which participants experienced these stages was highly idiosyncratic. Indeed, the perceived impact, scale, and, ultimately, consequential developmental impact of these challenges appeared to vary greatly with participants displaying different responses to similar events. Such differences were underpinned by several individual factors (such as prior experiences and perceived coping skills), contextual characteristics of the challenge (such as type and timing) and support around the challenge (such as priming and reflection opportunities). Implications include the need for coaches and psychologists to systematically assess and carefully monitor the individual circumstances, needs and skillset of young performers and use this information as a platform for deploying individualised, timely and developmentally appropriate challenges along with relative support to ensure optimal learning and growth from them.",['Papastaikoudis F; Collins R; Collins D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39027717,longitudinally tracked nine young footballers from progressive age-bands. participants experienced challenge over a 15-month period. participants exhibited different responses to similar events.
Nongestational ovarian choriocarcinoma with bilateral teratoma: A rare case report and literature review.,"Trophoblastic neoplasms are often associated with pregnancy, and nongestational trophoblastic neoplasms are extremely rare. Nongestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGCO) is a highly aggressive germ cell-derived tumor frequently presenting with early hematogenous metastasis. Herein, we report a case of a 28-year-old unmarried woman with regular menstruation who experienced vaginal bleeding 1 week after her last menstrual cycle. Doppler ultrasound revealed bilateral adnexal masses and elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. The patient was initially misdiagnosed as presenting an ectopic pregnancy. The final pathology confirmed an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA NGCO with bilateral mature teratoma of the ovary. This is an extraordinary instance of ovarian choriocarcinoma which emerged without any prior gestation, and the patient's lack of a history of pregnancy made the diagnosis ignored. After initial surgery and 1 cycle of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy, a laparoscopic fertility-preserving comprehensive staging surgery was performed. Two cycles of chemotherapy with BEP were administered as supplemental therapy postsurgery, and leuprorelin was administered to protect ovarian function. Menstruation resumed 4 months after chemotherapy completion, and tumor indicators were within the normal range. No signs of recurrence were observed at the 36-month follow-up. NGCO should be considered if a female patient exhibits irregular vaginal bleeding and masses in the adnexal area. The present case and our literature review also highlighted that fertility-sparing surgery and multidrug chemotherapy are effective methods for treating NGCO.",['Ao X; Hu S; Tan S; Xiong W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38701311,nongestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGCO) is a highly aggressive germ cell-derived tumor presenting with early hematogenous metastasis. this is a rare case report and literature review.
Psycho-Social Behaviour of Urban Indian Adolescent Girls during menstruation.,"Adolescence in females signifies the transition from girlhood to womanhood and is marked with the onset of menarche. Indian society is interwoven into a set of traditions, myths and misconceptions, especially regarding menstruation and related issues. The present study was conducted to assess knowledge and psycho-social behavior related to menstruation among adolescent girls in urban Haryana (state), India. A total of 478 adolescent girls in the age group of 15 -19 years from three educational institutes of Rohtak city were selected randomly. It was a community-based, descriptive, cross-sectional questionnaire based study, and a pre-tested, pre-coded, closed ended questionnaire was used. Feeling of sickness was the most common (in more than two-third of subjects) followed by irritability and emotional disturbances. More than 3/4(th) of the subjects did not worship during menstruation, 45% were not allowed in kitchen and nearly one-fourth followed dietary restrictions. More than 16% subjects thought menstruation to be a sign of onset of a disease and little more than 7 % thought it to be a curse. Girls preferred to discuss their menstruation related problems either with their mothers or with their friends. Girls have inaccurate and partial information regarding menstruation.

Factors affecting age of onset of menopause and determination of quality of life in menopause.,"Menopause is a process in the climacteric period, characterized by a reduction in ovarian activity, a fall in the fertility rate, and a range of symptoms including irregular menstruation intervals. Most women enter menopause in their 40s, but this can vary from one individual to another. Although there are many factors affecting the age of menopause onset, there is no general agreement on them. Studies have shown many factors to affect the age of menopause, such as the mother's age at menopause, the age at menarche, gestational age, use of oral contraceptives, irregular menstrual cycle, number of pregnancies, body mass index, use of tobacco and alcohol, physical activity, unilateral oophorectomy, serum lead levels, consumption of polyunsaturated fat, socioeconomic status and educational level. During this period, hormonal and biochemical changes give rise to various symptoms in the woman's body. In menopause period, physical, psychological, social and sexual changes have a negative effect on quality of life in women. Recently, different measures have been used to assess women's quality of life in this period of change. The purpose of this review was to examine the factors affecting the onset age of menopause and the measures of quality of life related to menopause.",['Ceylan B; Özerdoğan N'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28913040,"menopause is a process in the climacteric period, characterized by a reduction in ovarian activity, a fall in the fertility rate, and a range of symptoms including irregular menstruation intervals. studies have shown many factors to affect the age of menopause, but there is no general agreement on them."
Association of Inflammation Biomarkers with Food Cravings and Appetite Changes Across the Menstrual Cycle.,"Premenstrual symptoms, including food cravings, are often a regular complaint among menstruating women. However, existing evidence regarding the biological mechanisms by which these food cravings occur remains unclear. Inflammation may play an essential role in the occurence of these food cravings before menstruation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the associations between inflammatory markers and the risk of moderate/severe food cravings while accounting for changes in hormone levels and stress across the menstrual cycle. The BioCycle Study followed women (n=259) aged 18-44 for two menstrual cycles. Food cravings (via questionnaire) were assessed up to four times per cycle. Each assessment corresponded to menses and mid-follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. A wide range of cytokine and chemokine levels (hsCRP, GCSF, GMCSF, IL-4, IL-6, RANTES, MIP1B, etc.) were assessed in blood samples collected at up to 8 visits per cycle, with visits timed using fertility monitors. Cravings for chocolate, sweets, salty, and other foods, and changes in appetite were determined to estimate the odds of moderate or severe cravings. Associations between inflammatory markers and risk of reporting a moderate/severe craving symptom at each cycle visit was determined using weighted generalized linear models (e.g., marginal structural models). Models were adjusted for age, BMI, and race, as well as time-varying covariates such as estradiol, stress, leptin, and total energy intake, and accounted for repeated measures (i.e., multiple cycles per woman). Both inflammatory markers and reports of cravings were modeled to account for variation at each visit. An association between higher inflammatory biomarkers such as hsCRP, GCSF, GMCSF, IL-4, IL-6, RANTES, MIP1B, and increased risk of moderate/severe cravings were identified across the menstrual cycle |all risk ratio>0.8, all CIs range>0.7-0.9|. hsCRP retained statistical significance after false discovery rate correction with chocolate, sweet, and salty cravings, while GCSF, GMCSF, IL-6, and RANTES retained significance with chocolate and sweet cravings only. The results suggest a potential role of inflammation in food cravings and appetite changes across the menstrual cycle.",['Agarwal K; Franks AT; Zhang X; Schisterman E; Mumford SL; Joseph PV'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778220,inflammation may play an essential role in the occurence of these food cravings. the bioCycle Study followed women (n=259) aged 18-44 for two menstrual cycles.
The development and initial validation of the Health and Reproductive Survey (HeRS).,"Due to the diversity in profiles associated with the female reproductive cycle and their potential physiological and psychological effects, monitoring the reproductive status of exercising females is important from a practical and research perspective. Moreover, as physical activity can influence menstrual function, the effects of physical activity energy expenditure on reproductive function should also be considered. The aim of this study was to develop and establish initial face and content validity of the Health and Reproductive Survey (HeRS) for physically active females, which is a retrospective assessment of menstrual function from menarche (first menstruation) to menopause (cessation of menstruation). Face validity was evaluated qualitatively, and the initial content validity was established through a principal component analysis. The face validity process was completed by 26 females aged 19-67 years and the content validity was established through a survey sent to a convenience sample of 392 females, of which 230 females (57.9% and aged 18-49 years) completed the survey. The revisions made following the face validation improved the understanding, flow, and coherence of the survey. The principal component analysis indicated that, at a minimum, the survey measures these constructs: menstrual cessation and associated moderators, athletic participation and performance levels (as associated with menstruation change and the menstrual cycle), age and menstrual cessation, hormonal contraception (""birth control""), and menarche and associated moderators. The Health and Reproductive Survey (HeRS) is a partially validated tool that can be used by researchers to characterize the menstrual status of physically active females relative to their physical activity status.",['Duffy D; Yourkavitch J; Bruinvels G; Rinaldi NJ; Wideman L'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34348519,the health and reproductive survey (HeRS) is a retrospective assessment of menstrual function from menarche to menopause. the first menstruation was completed by 26 females aged 19-67 years. the initial content validity was established through a survey sent to a convenience sample of 392 females.
Identifying the Number of Steps Required for Familiarisation to Athletic Footwear in Healthy Older Adults.,"Research on athletic footwear familiarisation within an older population is sparse. This is problematic because unfamiliar footwear may act as a new perturbation and modify older adults' walking gait and stability. In addition, while athletic footwear has been suggested to enhance older adults' comfort and support during activities of daily living, the necessary period for familiarisation with athletic footwear is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the number of steps required for older adults to be familiarised with athletic footwear of different midsole thicknesses. Twenty-six healthy and physically active community-dwelling older adults, 21 females (71.1 ± 4.5 years; 164.5 ± 5.3 cm; 68.4 ± 11.4 kg) and five males (70.6 ± 2.3 years; 175.2 ± 7.8 cm; 72.8 ± 9.7 kg) completed a walking-based protocol. Participants walked two trials of 200 steps at their habitual speed on a 10 m track of an optical measurement system in three footwear conditions: 1) New Balance® REVlite 890v6 (thick midsole); 2) New Balance® REVlite 1400v5 (moderate midsole); and 3) New Balance® Minimus 20v7 (thin midsole). Gait speed (m.s-1) and walking time (min) were analysed for each participant over the 400 steps. Number of required familiarisation steps were established over three analysis phases, consisting of steady state gait assessment, averaging and analysis of blocks of 40 steps, and sequentially comparing these steps with a pre-determined threshold. Footwear familiarisation was assumed when the mean gait speed fell within an acceptable level (± 2 SD from 320 to 360 step values) and subsequently maintained. Most participants were familiarised with all three footwear conditions (thick n= 18; moderate and thin n= 20) after walking 80 steps. For all participants, the moderate midsole had the shortest familiarisation period (160 steps). The highest number of familiarisation steps were found in the thick (320 steps) and thin midsoles (240 steps) for some participants. A minimum of 320 familiarisation steps is recommended to account for both individual differences and midsole thicknesses. Implementing this walking-based footwear familiarisation protocol would improve validity of future studies, ensuring they analyse footwear effects rather than familiarisation with the footwear.",['Soares D; Fletcher I; Mitchell A; Charalambous L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39047716,study aims to identify number of steps required for familiarisation with athletic footwear. participants walked 200 steps at habitual speed on a 10 m track.
Medical and Psychosocial Challenges Associated with Breast Cancer Survivorship.,"Objective To assess the association between common survivorship issues and characteristics of breast cancer survivors presenting at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.  Methodology This study was conducted in the medical oncology department of Jinnah Medical Postgraduate Center from March 27, 2019, to September 27, 2019. A number of 257 females of age group 18-90 years who had either completed their treatment or were undergoing treatment at the time were included using non-probability consecutive sampling techniques. Face-to-face interviews were personally conducted by the researcher, and data regarding the socio-demographics and common survivorship issues faced by breast cancer patients were obtained. The data acquired were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results The mean age of the breast cancer survivors were 42.58 ± 10.07 years. Of the main challenges, lack of energy received the highest mean score of 3.44 ± 1.26, followed by fatigue and financial issues. Overall the most common survivorship issue were financial issues (81.3%), followed by fatigue (80.9%), cessation of the menstrual cycle (66.1%), weak social support (59.1%), and cosmetic disfigurement (51.8%).

Therapeutic Management of Giant Uterine Fibroid: A Case Report.,"The most common benign tumor that affects female reproductive system is a uterine fibroid or leiomyomas, especially during their reproductive years. The prevalence is around 20-40% women in the age group of 14-45 years. The following case report proffers the diagnosis and management of a female diagnosed with uterine fibroids. In this case a 45-year-old woman presented to the tertiary rural hospital with an unusually large distended abdomen which on examination and imaging revealed a big fibroid growing inside the uterus. The case highlights the significance of a collaborative approach involving gynecologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons. Their combined expertise provides patients with various treatment options: medical management, minimally invasive procedures, and surgical interventions. During the decision-making process, factors such as the patient's age, desire for fertility preservation, and impact of fibroids on her quality of life are taken into account. This particular case showcases successful pre-hysterectomy uterine artery embolization of large uterine leiomyoma while emphasizing the importance of personalized care and shared decision making for optimal patient outcomes.",['Rout M; Dave A; Bakshi SS'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38046766,the most common benign tumor that affects female reproductive system is a uterine fibroid or leiomyomas. the prevalence is around 20-40% women in the age group of 14-45 years.
"Process evaluation of comprehensive sexuality education programme in Zambia: a focus on contextual factors, mechanisms of impact, quality of development and implementation process.","Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is critical in addressing negative sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes among adolescents. Yet in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Zambia, little is known about the impact, realities of CSE implementation, the quality of teaching and the comprehensiveness of the content covered. Our approach was informed by a process evaluation incorporating recommendations by the European Expert Group guidance on evaluating sexuality education programmes and the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines on process evaluation. The development process and quality of CSE implementation were assessed using eight and six quality criteria respectively. In-depth interviews (IDIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), document analysis and classroom observation were employed to assess contextual factors, implementation process and mechanisms of impact of CSE. In-depth interviews (50) and focus group discussions (2) with seven pupils in each group were conducted among 64 purposefully selected participants. The sample comprised pupils (35), parents (4) and teachers (17) from nine secondary schools (four peri-urban, four urban and one rural), policymakers (4), and religious leaders (4). We employed deductive content analysis to analyse the data. Contextual factors that influenced the implementation of CSE included: (1) piecemeal funding for the CSE programme; (2) lack of monitoring programmes in schools; (3) lack of community engagement; (4) religious and socio-cultural barriers; (5) lack of skills and competency to teach CSE; and (6) insufficient time allocation for CSE. The assessment of the quality of the development of CSE revealed: (1) a lack of sexual diversity; (2) no meaningful participation of pupils in programme implementation; (3) a lack of stakeholder engagement during programme implementation; (4)  lack of gender sensitivity; and (5) lack of human rights approach. Assessment of the quality of the implementation of CSE revealed: (1) no evidence of skill-based CSE teaching; (2) no linkage between CSE and SRH services in the communities; and (3) a lack of incorporation of multiple delivery methods during CSE teaching. The mechanisms of impact of CSE were related to the acceptability and positive changes in pupils' SRH practices. The complex influences of contextual factors during CSE implementation highlight the need for contextual analysis during the interventional design. Co-creation of the CSE programme through stakeholder participation could reduce social opposition and enable a culturally sensitive CSE. Comprehensive teacher training, a guiding curriculum as well as setting of appropriate monitoring tools and indicators are likely to enhance the quality of CSE implementation.",['Mukanga B; Dlamini SB; Taylor M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39054454,"comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is critical in addressing negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes among adolescents. but in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Zambia, little is known about the impact, realities of CSE implementation, the quality of teaching and the comprehensiveness of the content covered."
Progesterone-induced progesterone receptor membrane component 1 rise-to-decline changes are essential for decidualization.,"Decidualization of endometrial cells is the prerequisite for embryo implantation and subsequent placenta formation and is induced by rising progesterone levels following ovulation. One of the hormone receptors contributing to endometrial homeostasis is Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1), a non-classical membrane-bound progesterone receptor with yet unclear function. In this study, we aimed to investigate how PGRMC1 contributes to human decidualization. We first analyzed PGRMC1 expression profile during a regular menstrual cycle in RNA-sequencing datasets. To further explore the function of PGRMC1 in human decidualization, we implemented an inducible decidualization system, which is achieved by culturing two human endometrial stromal cell lines in decidualization-inducing medium containing medroxyprogesterone acetate and 8-Br-cAMP. In our system, we measured PGRMC1 expression during hormone induction as well as decidualization status upon PGRMC1 knockdown at different time points. We further conferred proximity ligation assay to identify PGRMC1 interaction partners. In a regular menstrual cycle, PGRMC1 mRNA expression is gradually decreased from the proliferative phase to the secretory phase. In in vitro experiments, we observed that PGRMC1 expression follows a rise-to-decline pattern, in which its expression level initially increased during the first 6 days after induction (PGRMC1 increasing phase) and decreased in the following days (PGRMC1 decreasing phase). Knockdown of PGRMC1 expression before the induction led to a failed decidualization, while its knockdown after induction did not inhibit decidualization, suggesting that the progestin-induced 'PGRMC1 increasing phase' is essential for normal decidualization. Furthermore, we found that the interactions of prohibitin 1 and prohibitin 2 with PGRMC1 were induced upon progestin treatment. Knocking down each of the prohibitins slowed down the decidualization process compared to the control, suggesting that PGRMC1 cooperates with prohibitins to regulate decidualization. According to our findings, PGRMC1 expression followed a progestin-induced rise-to-decline expression pattern during human endometrial decidualization process; and the correct execution of this expression program was crucial for successful decidualization. Thereby, the results of our in vitro model explained how PGRMC1 dysregulation during decidualization may present a new perspective on infertility-related diseases.",['Liu H; Franken A; Bielfeld AP; Fehm T; Niederacher D; Cheng Z; Neubauer H; Stamm N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38308254,progesterone receptor membrane component 1 is a non-classical membrane-bound progesterone receptor. a progesterone receptor is induced by rising progesterone levels following ovulation.
The persistent power of stigma: A critical review of policy initiatives to break the menstrual silence and advance menstrual literacy.,"Menstruation is shrouded in stigma and shame-that is the common refrain in burgeoning initiatives on menstrual health and hygiene. Public policies alone cannot undo stigma and enact social change, but they do interact with social norms. They can reflect and adopt stigmatizing attitudes and, as a result, institutionalize, formalize, and legitimize stigma; or they can actively challenge and denounce it and mitigate existing discrimination. Against this background, we explored whether and how policies on menstrual health and hygiene address menstrual stigma and advance menstrual literacy based on an analysis of 34 policy documents and 85 in-depth interviews with policy-makers and advocates in four countries: India, Kenya, Senegal, and the United States. We found that policies recognized menstrual stigma and set out to break the silence surrounding menstruation and advance menstrual education, but they did not contribute to dismantling menstrual stigma. Policy-makers seemed constrained by the very stigma they sought to tackle, resulting in hesitancy and missed opportunities. Policies raised awareness of menstruation, often with great noise, but they simultaneously called for hiding and concealing any actual, visible signs of menstruation and its embodied messiness. Educational initiatives mostly promoted bodily management and control, rather than agency and autonomy. As a result, policies might have succeeded in breaking the silence around menstruation, but stigma cannot be broken as easily. We first need to recognize its (invisible) power and its impacts in all spheres of life in order to actively challenge, dismantle, and redefine it.",['Olson MM; Alhelou N; Kavattur PS; Rountree L; Winkler IT'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36962272,a critical review of policy initiatives to break the silence around menstruation. adam sutter: policies on menstrual health and hygiene address menstrual stigma. he says policy-makers seemed constrained by the very stigma they sought to tackle. sutter: policies may have succeeded in breaking the silence around menstruation.
Associations of Menstrual Cycle and Progesterone-to-Estradiol Ratio With Alcohol Consumption in Alcohol Use Disorder: A Sex-Separated Multicenter Longitudinal Study.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) constitutes a critical public health issue and has sex-specific characteristics. Initial evidence suggests that progesterone and estradiol might reduce or increase alcohol intake, respectively. However, there is a need for a better understanding of how the menstrual cycle in females and the ratio of progesterone to estradiol in females and males influence alcohol use patterns in individuals with AUD. In this sex-separated multicenter longitudinal study, the authors analyzed 12-month data on real-life alcohol use (from 21,460 smartphone entries), menstrual cycle, and serum progesterone-to-estradiol ratios (from 667 blood samples at four individual study visits) in 74 naturally cycling females and 278 males with AUD between 2020 and 2022, using generalized and general linear mixed modeling. Menstrual cycle phases were significantly associated with binge drinking and progesterone-to-estradiol ratio. During the late luteal phase, females showed a lower predicted binge drinking probability of 13% and a higher predicted marginal mean of progesterone-to-estradiol ratio of 95 compared with during the menstrual, follicular, and ovulatory phases (binge drinking probability and odds ratios vs. late luteal phase, respectively: 17%, odds ratio=1.340, 95% CI=1.031, 1.742; 19%, odds ratio=1.523, 95% CI=1.190, 1.949; and 20%, odds ratio=1.683, 95% CI=1.285, 2.206; difference in progesterone-to-estradiol ratios, respectively: -61, 95% CI=-105.492, -16.095; -78, 95% CI=-119.322, -37.039; and -71, 95% CI=-114.568, -27.534). In males, a higher progesterone-to-estradiol ratio was related to lower probabilities of binge drinking and of any alcohol use, with a 10-unit increase in the hormone ratio resulting in odds ratios of 0.918 (95% CI=0.843, 0.999) and 0.914 (95% CI=0.845, 0.988), respectively. These ecologically valid findings suggest that high progesterone-to-estradiol ratios can have a protective effect against problematic alcohol use in females and males with AUD, highlighting the progesterone-to-estradiol ratio as a promising treatment target. Moreover, the results indicate that females with AUD may benefit from menstrual cycle phase-tailored treatments.",['Hoffmann S; Gerhardt S; Mühle C; Reinhard I; Reichert D; Bach P; Boroumand-Jazi R; Kuehner C; Aguilera A; Aslan A; Bahr NS; Belanger M; Deeken F; Ebrahimi C; Fischbach PC; Ganz M; Garbusow M; Großkopf CM; Heigert M; Hentschel A; Karl D; Liu S; Mazza M; Pelz P; Pinger M; Reichl M; Riemerschmid C; Rosenthal A; Steffen J; Strehle J; Wedemeyer F; Weiss F; Wenzel J; Wieder G; Wieland A; Zaiser J; Zech HG; Zimmermann S; Kornhuber J; Müller CP; Sommer WH; Spanagel R; Banaschewski T; Deserno L; Ebner-Priemer UW; Flor H; Kirsch P; Rietschel M; Vollstädt-Klein S; Walter H; Meyer-Lindenberg A; Rapp MA; Witt S; Smolka MN; Heinz A; Tost H; Kiefer F; Reichert M; Lenz B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38196336,"menstrual cycle and progesterone-to-estradiol ratios are associated with binge drinking. menstrual cycle phases were significantly associated with binge drinking. progesterone-to-estradiol ratio was 95 compared with during the menstrual, follicular, and ovulatory phases."
Exploring Menstrual Education via TikTok: A Descriptive Content Analysis.,"TikTok has rapidly emerged as one of the foremost social media platforms for young adults and adolescents, becoming the most-downloaded app in 2022. With its broad reach across demographics, TikTok may be leveraged as a tool for teaching and destigmatizing topics such as menstruation. This study is the first to analyze the quality of menstruation-related content on TikTok. This cross-sectional study of TikTok videos and corresponding accounts examined six pre-determined menstruation-related hashtags in May 2023. Deductive qualitative analysis was performed between three coders to identify themes and content of the available videos. A total of 140 videos created by 107 unique accounts were identified. The videos had varying purposes including audience education (66%), entertainment (35%), and product advertisement (17%). Videos mentioned various menstrual hygiene products, menstruation-related advice, and symptoms of menses. A vast majority of videos appeared to be created by laypersons with only 8% being led by health-care professionals. With TikTok's usage as a social platform among youth, it displays potential as a tool to enhance menstrual education and destigmatization. There is a need for more menstruation experts to join the platform and provide quality material for users.",['Olsson SE; Friedlich N; Bolds A; Hodge A; Jamali T; Lagomichos M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38852086,TikTok is the most-downloaded app in 2022. it is the first to analyze the quality of menstruation-related content on the app.
Prevalence of and risk factors for self-reported menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination: a Danish cohort study.,"Are there some characteristics that render individuals more susceptible to report menstrual changes following the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination? We found that 30% of menstruating women reported menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination and several potential risk factors including stress, vaccine concerns, severe COVID-19 infection, and immediate vaccine symptoms were associated with these reports. Studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccination might temporarily prolong menstrual cycle length by less than 1 day. Specific characteristics may trigger menstrual changes in temporal relation to the vaccination simply by chance or render women more vigilant to potential menstrual changes after being vaccinated. However, research investigating potential risk factors for reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination is limited. A population-based Danish cohort study. Data were collected from May 2021 to December 2021 as a part of the BiCoVac Cohort with the aim of examining non-specific effects following COVID-19 vaccination. The main study population included 13 648 menstruating women aged 16-65 years who completed all surveys, received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during the data collection period, and completed questions related to their menstrual cycle. Potential risk factors included 14 biological, physical, or psychological measures. Information on most potential risk factors was self-reported and collected before the participants' first COVID-19 vaccination. Information about any menstrual change following COVID-19 vaccination was self-reported at the end of the data collection period. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for the association between each potential risk factor and reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination. Any menstrual change following COVID-19 vaccination was reported by 30% of menstruating women. Most of the potential risk factors were associated with reports of menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination. In particular, higher odds were found among women who reported ≥5 immediate vaccine symptoms; OR 1.67 [1.50-1.86], had had a prior severe COVID-19 infection; OR 2.17 [1.40-3.35], had a high-stress level at baseline; OR 1.67 [1.32-2.10], or were concerned about COVID-19 vaccines prior to vaccination; OR 1.92 [1.50-2.45]. Lower odds were found among women with regular menstrual cycles using hormonal contraception; OR 0.71 [0.65-0.78]. We were unable to address the causal effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the reported menstrual changes, as information about menstrual changes was not available among non-vaccinated women. The study identified several potential risk factors for reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination. Further studies are needed to establish causal associations and the clinical impact of self-reported menstrual changes. The BiCoVac data collection was funded by TrygFonden (id-number: 153678).

Spontaneous recurrent menstrual pneumothorax: a case report.,"Endometriosis is most commonly found in the pelvic area, ~12% of people have it in other areas or organs, which is known as extrapelvic endometriosis. Thoracic endometriosis, which is also classified as extrapelvic endometriosis, manifests with four distinct forms: catamenial pneumothorax, catamenial hemothorax, catamenial hemoptysis, or lung nodules. Catamenial pneumothorax is the most common clinical symptom of these; however, it is frequently neglected by clinicians and goes undiagnosed and untreated. As a result, it is critical to raise awareness of this medical condition among clinicians. The authors present a case report of a 34-year-old woman of reproductive age who had recurrent episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax during menstruation and underwent treatment with thoracoscopic surgery as well as gynaecological hormonal drugs including oral progesterone and dienogest throughout this time. Based on her symptoms, a catamenial pneumothorax caused by thoracic endometriosis was suspected. The clinical symptoms, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Catamenial Pneumothorax are analyzed. Furthermore, the usage of gynaecological hormone medications in this condition has been discussed. The mechanisms of oral contraceptives and progestin-based medications are evaluated by comparing the patient's treatment process, highlighting their pros and cons. Thoracoscopic surgery combined with postoperative gynaecological hormonal medications may be the most effective treatment for this issue. Several gynaecological hormonal medicines are available, each of which has its own set of pros and cons, and must be thoroughly evaluated as well as correctly tailored to the patient's specific circumstances to have a positive therapeutic outcome.",['Hirono T; Feng Y; Wang W; Yu H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38333324,"12% of people have it in other areas or organs, which is known as extrapelvic endometriosis. catamenial pneumothorax is the most common clinical symptom of these. however, it is frequently neglected by clinicians and goes undiagnosed and untreated."
Drivers of associations between daytime-nighttime compound temperature extremes and mortality in China.,"Temperature extremes are anticipated to become more frequent and more intense under the context of climate change. While current evidence on health effects of compound extreme temperature event is scarce. This nationwide cross-sectional study collected daily data on weather and mortality for 161 Chinese districts/counties during 2007-2013. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear model was first applied to assess effects of daytime-only, nighttime-only and compound daytime-nighttime heat wave (and cold spell) on cause-specific mortality. Then a random-effect meta-analysis was used to produce pooled estimates at national level. Stratification analyses were performed by relative humidity, individual and regional characteristics. Here we show that mortality risks of compound daytime-nighttime temperature extremes are much higher than those occurring only in the daytime or nighttime. Humid weather further exaggerates the mortality risk during heat waves, while dry air enhances the risk during cold weather. People who are elderly, illiterate, and those with ischemic heart disease and respiratory disease are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperature. At the community-level, population size, urbanization rate, proportion of elderly and PM2.5 are positively associated with increased risks associated with heat waves. Temperature, humidity and normalized difference vegetation index are positively associated with the effects of cold weather, with an opposite trend for latitude and diurnal temperature range. This nationwide study highlights the importance of incorporating compound daytime-nighttime extreme temperature events and humid conditions into early warning systems and urban design/planning.",['Yang J; Zhou M; Guo C; Zhu S; Sakhvidi MJZ; Requia WJ; Sun Q; Tong S; Li M; Liu Q'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937621,"nationwide cross-sectional study collected daily data on weather and mortality for 161 districts/counties during 2007-2013. a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model was first applied to assess effects of daytime-only, nighttime-only and compound daytime-nighttime heat wave (and cold spell) on cause-specific mortality."
Promising effects of exosomes from menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells on endometriosis.,"Endometriosis as a non-malignant gynecological disease leads to dysregulation of numerous cellular functions including apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and inflammation. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the importance of endometrial stem cells within the menstrual blood which are involved in the establishment and progression of endometriotic lesions in a retrograde manner. According to the fact that the therapeutic benefits of mesenchymal stem cells are provided through paracrine functions, we used exosomes from menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) for treating endometriotic stem cells to inhibit their lesion formation tendency. Menstrual blood samples from healthy and endometriosis women were collected. Isolated MenSCs by the density-gradient centrifugation method were characterized by flow cytometry. Secreted exosomes were isolated from healthy MenSCs (NE-MenSCs) and used to treat endometriotic cells (E-MenSCs). 72 h after treatment, different mechanisms and pathways including inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis were analyzed using Real-Time PCR, ELISA, immunocytochemistry, annexin V/PI, and scratching assay. Exosome treatment significantly reduce the expression level of markers related to inflammation, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in E-MenSCs which are aberrantly expressed in endometriosis. Moreover, apoptosis was induced in E-MenSCs after treatment which was evaluated in both gene and protein levels. In this study, we give preliminary evidence for the potential of MenSCs-Exo in ameliorating endometriosis. Regarding our results, we suggest that after relevant clinical trial, MenSCs-derived exosomes can be considered as a better treatment option to improve endometriosis compared to common and conventional treatments and show their potential as a cell-free product in endometriosis repair.",['Davoodi Asl F; Sahraei SS; Kalhor N; Fazaeli H; Sheykhhasan M; Soleimani Moud S; Naserpour L; Sheikholeslami A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37542905,"exosomes from menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells inhibit lesion formation tendency. exosome treatment significantly reduce expression level of markers related to inflammation, proliferation, proliferation, and inflammation."
Menopause and crisis? Fake or real: comprehensive search to the depth of crisis experienced: a mixed-method study.,"Menopause is beyond the lack of menstruation and fertility decline in estrogen. Menopause is associated with at least three types of crisis: Biological, psychological and social. The aim of this study was to investigate psychiatric problems related to menopausal stress and experiences about psychological conditions related to menopause as a developmental crisis. This mixed-method study (by triangulation approach) was done on 300 women in menopause age (44-54 years) by consensus sampling. Data gathering was from questionnaire conclude psychosomatic listed and hypochondria's criterion that has been specified by DSMIV. The severity of the disorder was also collected by self-reported question.

Compounding to Prevent and Treat Dysbiosis of the Human Vaginal Microbiome.,"Homeostasis of the human vaginal microbiome, which consists of the bacteriome (colonizing bacteria) and the mycobiome (resident fungi), is essential to the health of the female reproductive system. Dysbiosis of either microbial community can be caused by a variety of factors ranging from behavioral issues (personal-hygiene practices, the choice of contraceptives, smoking, etc.) to biological variables (the host-microbiome composition, menstruation, the robustness of the host's immune response). Clinicians often consult compounding pharmacistsbabout the formulation and use of customized preparations to treat vaginal diseases and re-establish a healthful vaginal microenvironment when commercially manufactured products have failed or are unavailable. In this article, the function of the human vaginal bacteriome and mycobiome are examined, a common microorganism identified in each of those microenvironments is discussed, factors that cause dysbiosis are reviewed, and the role of biofilm in the vaginal microbiota is explored. A question typical of those asked by prescribers committed to improving women's health and decreasing the incidence of recurring bacterial vaginosis or fungal infections is answered. Formulations for compounds that help ensure or reestablish the homeostasis of the human vaginal bacteriome and mycobiome are also provided.",['Riepl M'],2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30384345,homeostasis of the human vaginal microbiome is essential to the health of the female reproductive system. the function of the human vaginal bacteriome and mycobiome is examined. the role of biofilm in the vaginal microbiota is explored.
Associations of Financial Strain and Unmet Social Needs with Women's Bladder Health.,"Financial strain and unmet social needs are associated with greater risk for lower urinary tract symptoms. Little research has examined financial strain and unmet social needs in relation to the more holistic concept of bladder health. This study utilizes baseline data from RISE FOR HEALTH: A U.S. Study of Bladder Health to examine whether financial strain, unmet social needs, and meeting specific federal poverty level threshold levels are associated with lower urinary tract symptoms and poorer perceived bladder health, well-being, and function. Participants were 18 years or older, born female or currently identified as a woman, and from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population residing in 50 counties in the United States that included or surrounded nine recruitment centers. Data were collected through mailed or internet-based surveys. To address research questions, the 10-item Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network Symptom Index and selected Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Research Consortium bladder health scores were separately regressed on each financial strain, unmet social need, and federal poverty level variable, using linear regression adjusting for covariates (age, race/ethnicity, education, and vaginal parity) and robust variance estimation for confidence intervals. Participants with no missing data for a given analysis were included (range of n=2,564 to 3,170). In separate sensitivity analyses, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes were added as covariates and missing data were imputed. The mean age of participants was 51.5 years (standard deviation=18.4). Not having enough money to make ends meet, housing insecurity, food insecurity, unreliable transportation, and percent federal poverty levels of 300% or less were consistently associated with more reported lower urinary tract symptoms and poorer perceived bladder health. For example, compared to food secure participants, women who worried that their food would run out at the end of the month had a Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network - Symptom Index score that was 3.4 points higher (95% CI: 2.5, 4.3), on average. They also had lower mean scores across different bladder health measures, each assessed using a 100-point scale: global bladder health (-8.2, 95% CI: -10.8,-5.7), frequency (-10.2, 95% CI: -13.8,-6.7), sensation (-11.6, 95% CI: -15.1,-8.2), continence (-13.3, 95% CI: -16.7,-9.9), and emotional impact of bladder health status (-13.2, 95% CI: -16.5,-9.9). Across analyses, associations largely remained significant after additional adjustment for body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes. The pattern of results when imputing missing data was similar to that observed with complete case analysis; all significant associations remained significant with imputation. Financial strain and unmet social needs are associated with worse LUTS and poorer bladder health. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether financial strain and unmet social needs influence the development, maintenance, and worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms; different mechanisms by which financial strain and unmet social needs may impact symptoms; and the degree to which symptoms contribute to financial strain. If supported by etiologic research, prevention research can be implemented to determine whether the amelioration of financial strain and social needs, including enhanced access to preventative care, may promote bladder health across the life course.",['Brady SS; Cunningham SD; Brubaker L; Falke C; James AS; Kenton KS; Low LK; Markland AD; McGwin G; Newman DK; Norton JM; Nuscis K; Rodriguez-Ponciano DP; Rudser KD; Smith AR; Stapleton A; Sutcliffe S; Klusaritz HA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39111516,"financial strain and unmet social needs are associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. study uses baseline data from RISE FOR HEALTH: a U.S. study of Bladder Health. participants were 18 years or older, born female or currently identified as a woman."
Extracting Vehicle Trajectories from Partially Overlapping Roadside Radar.,"This work presents a methodology for extracting vehicle trajectories from six partially-overlapping roadside radars through a signalized corridor. The methodology incorporates radar calibration, transformation to the Frenet space, Kalman filtering, short-term prediction, lane-classification, trajectory association, and a covariance intersection-based approach to track fusion. The resulting dataset contains 79,000 fused radar trajectories over a 26-h period, capturing diverse driving scenarios including signalized intersections, merging behavior, and a wide range of speeds. Compared to popular trajectory datasets such as NGSIM and highD, this dataset offers extended temporal coverage, a large number of vehicles, and varied driving conditions. The filtered leader-follower pairs from the dataset provide a substantial number of trajectories suitable for car-following model calibration. The framework and dataset presented in this work has the potential to be leveraged broadly in the study of advanced traffic management systems, autonomous vehicle decision-making, and traffic research.",['Schrader M; Hainen A; Bittle J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066038,"resulting dataset contains 79,000 fused radar trajectories over a 26-h period. the methodology incorporates radar calibration, transformation to the Frenet space, Kalman filtering, short-term prediction, lane-classification, trajectory association, and a covariance intersection-based approach to track fusion."
Cyclization increases bactericidal activity of arginine-rich cationic cell-penetrating peptide for <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>.,"We previously reported that a linear cationic 12-amino acid cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) was bactericidal for <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>. In this study, our objectives were to determine the effect of cyclization of the linear CPP on its antibacterial activity for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and cytotoxicity for human cells. We compared the bactericidal effect of 4-hour treatment with the linear CPP to that of CPPs cyclized by a thioether or a disulfide bond on human challenge and multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> grown in cell culture media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The effect of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) sialylation on bactericidal activity was analyzed. We determined the ability of the CPPs to treat human cells infected <i>in vitro</i> with <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, to reduce the inflammatory response of human monocytic cells to gonococci, to kill strains of three commensal <i>Neisseria</i> species, and to inhibit gonococcal biofilms. The cyclized CPPs killed 100% of gonococci from all strains at 100 µM and >90% at 20 µM and were more potent than the linear form. The thioether-linked but not the disulfide-linked CPP was less cytotoxic for human cervical cells compared to the linear CPP. LOS sialylation had minimal effect on bactericidal activity. In treating infected human cells, the thioether-linked CPP at 20 µM killed >60% of extra- and intracellular bacteria and reduced TNF-α expression by THP-1 cells. The potency of the CPPs for the pathogenic and the commensal <i>Neisseria</i> was similar. The thioether-linked CPP partially eradicated gonococcal biofilms. Future studies will focus on determining efficacy in the female mouse model of gonorrhea.IMPORTANCE<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> remains a major cause of sexually transmitted infections with 82 million cases worldwide in 2020, and 710,151 confirmed cases in the US in 2021, up 25% from 2017. <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> can infect multiple tissues including the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, and conjunctiva. The most serious sequelae are suffered by infected women as gonococci ascend to the upper reproductive tract and cause pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility in 10%-20% of women. Control of gonococcal infection is widely recognized as increasingly challenging due to the lack of any vaccine. <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> has quickly developed resistance to all but one class of antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains could result in untreatable infections. As such, gonorrhea is classified by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as an urgent public health threat. The research presented herein on new therapeutics for gonorrhea has identified a cyclic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) as a potent molecule targeting <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>.",['John CM; Otala SA; Jarvis GA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105587,cps bactericidal for i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae/i>. cps cyclized by thioether or a disulfide bond on human challenge.
The impact of socioeconomic status across early life on age at menarche among a racially diverse population of girls.,"We sought to evaluate the association between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) at two time points and age at menarche in a multiracial sample of U.S. girls. Our study population consisted of a cohort of female participants enrolled at birth at the New York site of the Collaborative Perinatal Project, who were born during the period 1959-1963 (n = 262). SES at birth, at age 7, and change between birth and age 7 were measured prospectively through an index score of family income, paternal occupation, and education. Data on age at menarche were collected retrospectively through adult self-report. We used multivariable linear regression to examine the association between SES and age at menarche after adjusting for childhood body mass index (BMI) and other covariates associated with age at menarche. After adjustment, SES at age 7 was positively associated with age at menarche (beta: 0.015, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.003-0.024 per unit of SES index). Change in SES was significantly associated with age at menarche; a 20-unit decrease in SES was associated with a 4-month decrease in age at menarche. Our results suggest that lower SES at 7 years and reductions in SES in early childhood are both associated with an earlier age at menarche.",['James-Todd T; Tehranifar P; Rich-Edwards J; Titievsky L; Terry MB'],2010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20933190,study population consisted of a cohort of female participants enrolled at birth. change between birth and age 7 measured prospectively. study results suggest lower SES at 7 years and reductions in SES in early childhood are both associated with an earlier age at menarche.
Challenges and Needs of HPV-Positive Women.,"HPV is the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases causing a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from warts to cancer. This study aimed to examine the challenges and needs of HPV-positive women. In this qualitative study, we analyzed data extracted from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 31 Iranian HPV-positive women using a conventional content analysis approach using MAXQDA.10 software. Data were collected from her at the women's clinic from 21 January 2022 to her 19 February 2022. The sampling process was purposeful, and the accuracy of this study was ensured according to her 4 criteria suggested by Guba and Lincoln. Four themes were identified from the interviewing of HPV-positive women that include: Needing support and counseling to adapt to the disease, needing counseling and training to improve the disease, needing a qualified health care provider, needing proper health care services. HPV-positive women had many adverse such as reproductive health challenges (Menstruation cycle, delivery type, fertility, pregnancy, and breastfeeding), low control, confusion, cancer-related concerns, relationship problems, sexual concerns, uncertainty, stigma, low trust, social impact, non-disclosure of results, idiosyncratic prevention, indirect clinical interaction, changes in sexual behavior. HPV-positive women face many challenges and seek information to address them. Therefore, at the primary level, providers need to be aware of the needs of these patients needs in order to make the necessary consultations.",['Galeshi M; Shirafkan H; Yazdani S; Motaghi Z'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36705022,study aims to examine the challenges and needs of HPV-positive women. data was collected from semi-structured interviews with 31 Iranian HPV-positive women using a conventional content analysis approach. four themes were identified from the interviewing of HPV-positive women.
"Greater sensitivity of the circadian system of women to bright light, but not dim-to-moderate light.","Women typically sleep and wake earlier than men and have been shown to have earlier circadian timing relative to the light/dark cycle that synchronizes the clock. A potential mechanism for earlier timing in women is an altered response of the circadian system to evening light. We characterized individual-level dose-response curves for light-induced melatonin suppression using a within-subjects protocol. Fifty-six participants (29 women, 27 men; aged 18-30 years) were exposed to a range of light illuminances (10, 30, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 2000 lux) using melatonin suppression relative to a dim control (<1 lux) as a marker of light sensitivity. Women were free from hormonal contraception. To examine the potential influence of sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone was examined in women and testosterone was examined in a subset of men. Menstrual phase was monitored using self-reports and estradiol and progesterone levels. Women exhibited significantly greater melatonin suppression than men under the 400-lux and 2000-lux conditions, but not under lower light conditions (10-200 lux). Light sensitivity did not differ by menstrual phase, nor was it associated with levels of estradiol, progesterone, or testosterone, suggesting the sex differences in light sensitivity were not acutely driven by circulating levels of sex hormones. These results suggest that sex differences in circadian timing are not due to differences in the response to dim/moderate light exposures typically experienced in the evening. The finding of increased bright light sensitivity in women suggests that sex differences in circadian timing could plausibly instead be driven by a greater sensitivity to phase-advancing effects of bright morning light.",['Vidafar P; McGlashan EM; Burns AC; Anderson C; Shechter A; Lockley SW; Phillips AJK; Cain SW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39041348,women exhibited greater melatonin suppression than men under the 400-lux and 2000-lux conditions. women exhibited significantly greater melatonin suppression than men under lower light conditions. women exhibited significantly greater melatonin suppression than men under the 400-lux and 2000-lux conditions.
Treat-and-Extend Versus Pro re nata Regimens of Ranibizumab and Aflibercept in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Comparative Study from Routine Clinical Practice.,"Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is generally given using pro re nata or ""treat-and-extend"" (T&E) regimens for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Randomized clinical trials have reported that T&E is superior to Pro re nata (PRN), but results from clinical trials may not always be replicated in clinical practice. Real-world data comparing T&E and PRN regimens for nAMD are limited. The objective of this work was to report 24-month outcomes of PRN versus T&E regimens for ranibizumab and aflibercept to treat nAMD in routine clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a prospectively designed observational outcomes registry, the Fight Retinal Blindness! Project (FRB). Treatment-naïve eyes starting nAMD treatment with at least three injections using a T&E or PRN regimen were tracked by using the FRB. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity (VA) measured by the number of letters read on a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution chart at 2 years versus baseline. The secondary outcome was the number of injections at 2 years. From January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2019, 3313 eyes from 2948 patients with nAMD were included: 1243 eyes from 1065 patients were classified as PRN and 2070 eyes from 1935 patients started a T&E regimen. At 24 months, patients on the T&E regimen experienced significantly greater mean (95% confidence interval) improvement in VA than those on PRN (+ 4.2 [3.1, 5.2] vs. + 1.3 [0.1, 2.6] letters; p < 0.001), with more injections (14.9 standard deviation(SD) 4.3) vs. 9.8(SD 4.3); p < 0.001). Eyes treated with a T&E regimen had better VA outcomes from VEGF inhibitors than eyes treated PRN. This large real-world data assessment supports previous data from randomized clinical trials that the T&E regimen delivers better outcomes than PRN.",['Debourdeau E; Beylerian H; Nguyen V; Barthelmes D; Gillies M; Gabrielle PH; Vujosevic S; Otoole L; Puzo M; Creuzot-Garcher C; Wolff B; Daien V'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38976148,anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is generally given using pro re nata. results from clinical trials may not always be replicated in clinical practice.
Clear cell ovarian cancer and endometriosis: is there a relationship?,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma is a rare type of ovarian cancer. In recent years, issues of the common genetic origin of endometriosis and ovarian clear cell carcinoma have been raised. Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of this type of cancer, risk factors, prognosis and its potential aetiological association with endometriosis. In a retrospective study, we analysed histopathological data of patients operated in the First Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (MU, Lodz) due to ovarian cancer in 2004-2014. Among the 394 patients operated on for ovarian cancer, clear cell carcinoma was found in 0.02% (9/394). Menstrual history, parity, comorbidities, data from physical examination, operational protocols and histopathological diagnoses were analysed. Follow-up was obtained from 77.8% of patients. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2013. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 57.6 years; the BMI in the study group was 27.2; the majority of patients were multiparous (77.8%). Clear cell carcinoma was detected mostly at stage Ia (n = 4). The concentration of Ca125 in the study group had an average of 142.75 U/ml and a median of 69.3 U/ml. The coexistence of endometriosis could not be clinically or histologically confirmed amongst our patients. The most common comorbidity in the study group was hypertension. In our clinical material, ovarian clear cell carcinoma is a rare histopathological specimen with a prognostic value comparable to that of serous ovarian cancer. Due to the rarity of this histopathological subtype, proving a cause-and-effect relationship between it and endometriosis can only be elucidated through statistical studies of the entire population.",['Szubert M; Suzin J; Obirek K; Sochacka A; Łoszakiewicz M'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582682,ovarian clear cell carcinoma is a rare type of ovarian cancer. the common genetic origin of endometriosis and ovarian clear cell carcinoma has been raised.
Efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation technique in primary dysmenorrhea: A randomized controlled trial.,"To examine the effects of Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique (JPMRT) on menstrual pain and symptoms, anxiety, quality of life (QoL), social activity, and work/school performance in primary dysmenorrhea (PD). Women with PD were randomly divided into two groups as relaxation and control groups. JPMRT was applied three times a week from the estimated date of ovulation to the onset of the next menstruation. No treatment was performed in the control group. Pain intensity, menstrual symptoms, anxiety, impacts on QoL, social activity, and work/school performance were assessed before and after the interventions. After the interventions, there was a further decrease in menstrual pain intensity, menstrual symptoms, anxiety level, the impact of QoL, and the work/school performance scores in the relaxation group than in the control group (p < 0.05). JPMRT might be used as an alternative method in the treatment of PD.",['Toprak Celenay S; Ozcelikel G; Bayrakli A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38802195,a randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation technique in primary dysmenorrhea. the trial was conducted in two groups.
Out of balance: the role of evolutionary mismatches in the sex disparity in autoimmune disease.,"Over the past century autoimmune disease incidence has increased rapidly in (post-) industrialised, affluent societies, suggesting that changes in ecology and lifestyle are driving this development. Epidemiological studies show that (i) 80% of autoimmune disease patients are female, (ii) autoimmune diseases co-occur more often in women, and (iii) the incidence of some autoimmune diseases is increasing faster in women than in men. The female preponderance in autoimmunity is most pronounced between puberty and menopause, suggesting that diverging sex hormone levels during the reproductive years are implicated in autoimmune disease development. Using an evolutionary perspective, we build on the hypotheses that female immunity is cyclical in menstruating species and that natural selection shaped the female immune system to optimise the implantation and gestation of a semi-allogeneic foetus. We propose that cyclical immunomodulation and female immune tolerance mechanisms are currently out of balance because of a mismatch between the conditions under which they evolved and (post-)industrialised, affluent lifestyles. We suggest that current changes in autoimmune disease prevalence may be caused by increases in lifetime exposure to cyclical immunomodulation and ovarian hormone exposure, reduced immune challenges, increased reproductive lifespan, changed reproductive patterns, and enhanced positive energy balance associated with (post-)industrialised, affluent lifestyles. We discuss proximate mechanisms by which oestrogen and progesterone influence tolerance induction and immunomodulation, and review the effect of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and contraceptive use on autoimmune disease incidence and symptoms.",['Keestra SM; Male V; Salali GD'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33964604,"80% of autoimmune disease patients are female, 80% of autoimmune diseases co-occur more often in women than in men. the incidence of some autoimmune diseases is increasing faster in women than in men. cyclical immunomodulation and female immune tolerance mechanisms are out of balance."
Role of social determinants and lifestyle on women's metabolic risk during the perimenopausal transition: results from a cohort study.,"Social determinants have been understudied in relation to metabolic risk and menopause; this study aimed to identify metabolic risk factors during menopausal transition, changes in lifestyle, and other social determinants. The Korean Genetic Epidemiologic Survey Community cohort data available for baseline, 2-year, and 4-year follow-up time points were analyzed. Healthy women ages 45 to 55 years, not taking hormonal therapy, were selected; 1,228 were analyzed. Menopausal transition was categorized as premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal. Lifestyle patterns consisted of alcohol consumption, exercise, ever smoking, indirect smoking, and eating breakfast. Generalized estimating equations were used for analysis. During the period of study, roughly 30% had become postmenopausal and metabolic syndrome was found in 11.5% to 14.4%. Controlling for other variables, lower income levels showed more than 2 times greater risk for metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women and those who continued to menstruate. Body mass index was a consistent factor of metabolic risk, which was more pronounced when analyzed by menopausal status, especially in obese menstruating women (odds ratio 30.72, P < 0.0001). Among women who experienced menopause during the observed time frame, less education and sedentary lifestyle were also significant factors in metabolic risk differences, showing 1.7 times and 1.59 times greater risk, respectively. Such differences in education, income, and sedentary lifestyle as significant risk factors in subgroups according to menstrual status change, may suggest vulnerable points in the transition. Implications include the need for stronger emphasis on weight control before midlife and experiencing menopause, promoting exercise across the menopausal transition, and supportive policy measures for economically disadvantaged women.",['Kim S; Ko Y; Yi G'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671189,"social determinants and lifestyle have been understudied in relation to metabolic risk and menopause. study aimed to identify metabolic risk factors during menopausal transition, changes in lifestyle, and other social determinants."
Comparative Efficacy of Mitchell's and Benson's Relaxation Techniques in Alleviating Pain and Improving Quality of Life Among Patients With Premenstrual Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background Most women of reproductive age suffer physical discomfort or distress in the weeks before menstruation. Even though symptoms are typically not severe enough to impede daily activities seriously, they occasionally can. Physical problems like breast discomfort and bloating can also be a problem. The most irritating symptoms are those that affect mood and behaviour. Women of reproductive age experience premenstrual syndrome frequently, necessitating study into non-pharmacological methods for symptom reduction. Methodology The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy of Benson's relaxation technique to Laura Mitchell's physiological approach in patients with premenstrual syndrome. Study design was comparative parallel experimental study with patient-reported questionnaire data (online) collected before and post-intervention in tertiary hospital setting. Participants were 70 adult females aged 18 to 35 with premenstrual syndrome. Patients were administered Benson's relaxation technique once a day for a month versus Mitchell's relaxation technique once a day for a month. Both techniques were first taught for one session followed by home program to be performed by patients. The premenstrual syndrome questionnaire and a numerical pain rating scale were used to quantify premenstrual symptoms pre and post-intervention. Results The result revealed significant (p<0.01) improvement in premenstrual symptoms in both groups following the intervention. However, Bensons' relaxation technique was found to be more significant while alleviating the premenstrual symptoms. Conclusions When it comes to lowering the intensity of premenstrual syndrome in young people, Benson's relaxation method is superior to Mitchell's. Both approaches should be entrenched as a regular practice and can be employed on patients to improve their menstrual well-being.",['Raipure A; Patil S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37746372,study was compared to the clinical efficacy of Benson's relaxation technique. the technique was found to be a positive improvement in premenstrual symptoms.
"The COVID-19 Vaccines Evaluation Program: Implementation, Management, and Experiences, 2021-2023.","In 2021, China's domestically produced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines received approval from regulatory bodies and were administered worldwide. Due to a low number of infections within China during that period, it became imperative to evaluate the vaccines' real-world effectiveness through international studies. To facilitate this, China CDC launched the COVID-19 Vaccines Evaluation Program (COVEP). This program formed research collaboration agreements with health institutes across five World Health Organization regions, addressing key questions about vaccine performance through ten cooperative agreements. The findings from COVEP projects reinforced confidence, both domestically and globally, in the effectiveness of the vaccines produced in China. Moreover, the outcomes observed internationally were frequently mirrored by later studies conducted within China. COVEP thus pioneered a novel approach for fostering cross-national research collaborations, addressing significant public health issues and exemplifying a framework for international cooperation. This approach is in line with the strategic objectives and other development efforts of China CDC's national disease control and prevention initiatives.",['Yan T; Zheng H; Li M; Ma C; Wang X; Wang X; Li Z; Chen Y; Hu W; Rodewald L; An Z; Yin Z; Feng Z'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38966313,the CDC launched the COVID-19 Vaccines Evaluation Program. the program formed research collaboration agreements with health institutes across five world health organizations. the results were frequently mirrored by later studies conducted within China.
[Impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function and quality of life of patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia].,"<b>Objective:</b> Using a questionnaire to evaluate different regimens of chemotherapy on ovarian function and quality of life of patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) . <b>Methods:</b> At least 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, 200 patients with GTN treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2010 to June 2017 were randomly selected to fill up the questionnaire. The questionnaire items were included the patient's menstrual cycles, sexual life, gestational issues and common health. The patients were divided into 3 groups by chemotherapy regimens: actinomycin D (Act-D) group, floxuridine+Act-D+vincristine (FAV) or floxuridine+Act-D+etoposide+vincristine (FAEV) group (FAV-FAEV group) , and etoposide+methotrexate+Act-D (EMA) /vincristine+cyclophosphamide (CO) or EMA/ etoposide+cisplatin (EP) group (EMA/CO-EMA/EP group) . Chi-square test was used with a significance level of <i>P</i>-value less than 0.05. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and seventy-three (86.5%,173/200) of the patients completed the questionnaire. Forty three point two percent (43.2%, 19/44) in the EMA/CO-EMA/EP group had a normal menstrual cycle, which were significantly lower than those of Act-D group (84.6%,22/26) and FAV-FAEV group (71.2%, 37/52; all <i>P<</i>0.05) . Amenorrhea rate was also significantly higher in EMA/CO-EMA/EP group (25.0%, 11/44) than in Act-D group (0) and FAV-FAEV group (17.3%, 9/52; all <i>P<</i>0.05) . The sexual life parameters were comparable among 3 groups. Ten out of thirty-two patients conceived after chemotherapy, 2 had miscarriages and 8 had full-term delivery of healthy babies. The common health and labor capacity were significantly decreased after chemotherapy (all <i>P<</i>0.05) . <b>Conclusions:</b> EMA/CO or EMA/EP regimen have a worse impact on ovarian function than Act-D and FAV or FAEV regimen.

Ictal activity is sustained by the estrogen receptor β during the estrous cycle.,"Catamenial epilepsy, defined as a periodicity of seizure exacerbation during the menstrual cycle, affects up to 70 % of epileptic women. Seizures in these patients are often non-responsive to medication; however, our understanding of the relation between menstrual cycle and seizure generation (i.e. ictogenesis) remains limited. We employed here field potential recordings in the <i>in vitro</i> 4-aminopyridine model of epileptiform synchronization in female mice (P60-P130) and found that: (i) the estrous phase favors ictal activity in the entorhinal cortex; (ii) these ictal discharges display an onset pattern characterised by the presence of chirps that are thought to mirror synchronous interneuron firing; and (iii) blocking estrogen receptor β-mediated signaling reduces ictal discharge duration. Our findings indicate that the duration of 4AP-induced ictal discharges, <i>in vitro</i>, increases during the estrous phase, which corresponds to the human peri-ovulatory period. We propose that these effects are caused by the presumptive enhancement of interneuron excitability due to increased estrogen receptor β-mediated signaling.",['Li FR; Lévesque M; Wang S; Carreño-Muñoz MI; Di Cristo G; Avoli M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38812499,catamenial epilepsy affects 70 % of epileptic women. ictogenesis is a period of seizure exacerbation during the menstrual cycle.
Spontaneous ovulation in the cat: incidence among queens presented at a veterinary teaching facility.,"The queen is recognised as an induced ovulator. Ovulation without male contact is generally regarded as spontaneous. The aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the incidence of spontaneous ovulation in a population of intact queens presented to a veterinary care facility for both reproductive and non-reproductive reasons. The secondary objective was to determine the roles of age, breed, body weight, presence of tom cats or other cycling queens, and physical contact with humans on triggering spontaneous ovulation, along with its implications. Serum samples from post-pubertal intact queens presented between January 2020 and June 2023 to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Padova, Italy, were retrieved and assayed for progesterone (P4) levels. Serum P4 above 2.0 ng/ml without a history of male contact was considered as proof of spontaneous ovulation. In total, 31 serum samples from 29 intact post-pubertal queens were obtained. Of the 31 samples, 14 had a P4 concentration above 2.0 ng/ml and 9/29 (31.0%) queens ovulated spontaneously. The mean age and weight of the nine spontaneously ovulating queens were 4.3 ± 5.7 years and 3.7 ± 0.8 kg, respectively. One queen ovulated spontaneously at her first heat at 6 months of age, which makes it the earliest spontaneous ovulation reported. As both our findings and previous publications indicate that the incidence of spontaneous ovulation in queens is consistently ⩾30%, cats should not be considered strictly induced ovulators, but as a species in which ovulation can be either spontaneous or induced. Since the risk of progesterone-dependent conditions (cystic endometrial hyperplasia - pyometra complex, feline mammary hypertrophy) is increased in these queens, veterinarians should be aware and advise breeders and clients accordingly.",['Pereira MC; Schrank M; Mollo A; Romagnoli S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39073920,the queen is recognised as an induced ovulator. the study was to provide an estimate of the incidence of spontaneous ovulation in a population of intact queens presented to a veterinary care facility.
Evaluation and management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common condition in women of reproductive age; however, adolescents with this issue present unique challenges in both diagnosis and management. Much of the research into this topic focuses on the adult population, with variable applicability to adolescents. There are currently no standard guidelines for the work up and treatment of adolescents with HMB. Current research into this topic has explored the utilization of standardized protocols in the evaluation of HMB in adolescents, the efficacy of various hormonal, nonhormonal, and surgical treatment modalities, and the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach. Recent literature has focused on adolescents found to have an underlying bleeding disorder, recommending more comprehensive bleeding disorder work up to identify these patients in a timely manner and initiate effective treatment plans. Providers in the primary care setting should be aware of the definitions for normal menses, and be able to recognize abnormal bleeding and HMB. Early recognition of HMB in adolescents can then lead to appropriate diagnosis of underlying disorders, and current research has proposed standard protocols to assist with the evaluation, ultimately leading to effective long-term management into adulthood.VIDEO ABSTRACT.",['Moon LM; Perez-Milicua G; Dietrich JE'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28858896,heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common condition in women of reproductive age. but adolescents present unique challenges in both diagnosis and management. current research has proposed standard protocols to assist with the evaluation.
Systematic review of menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal employing a social ecological model.,"Menstrual health and hygiene are a major public health and social issues in Nepal. Due to inadequate infrastructure to provide education, healthcare, and communication as well as religious teachings, women and girls are excluded from participation in many activities of daily living and community activities during menstruation. Evidence based research addressing menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal is scares. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective. This systematic review identifies knowledge gaps and targets for future research and interventions. Studies from Nepal that examined factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were identified through searches across six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Nepal Journals Online and Kathmandu University Medical Journal) in January 2019. The SEM is a public health framework that describes how health is impacted at multiple levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Key themes were identified, and factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were categorized as per the level of socio-ecological model (SEM). After a comprehensive literature review, twenty peer-reviewed publications, published between 2003 and January 2019 were included in this review. Eighteen studies were descriptive and two were interventional. The main outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Nine studies focused on knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, seven studies highlighted reproductive health issues, three studies focused on prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, and one on school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene, inadequate WASH facilities, no sex education and culturally restrictive practices makes menstruation a challenge for Nepali women. These challenges have negative implications on women and girls' reproductive as well as mental health and school attendance among adolescent girls. There are gaps in the evidence for high quality interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address needs identified at all levels of the SEM.",['Sharma A; McCall-Hosenfeld JS; Cuffee Y'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35773696,systematic review of menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal employing a social ecological model. the aim of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective.
Mechanisms of Scarless Repair at Time of Menstruation: Insights From Mouse Models.,"The human endometrium is a remarkable tissue which may experience up to 400 cycles of hormone-driven proliferation, differentiation and breakdown during a woman's reproductive lifetime. During menstruation, when the luminal portion of tissue breaks down, it resembles a bloody wound with piecemeal shedding, exposure of underlying stroma and a strong inflammatory reaction. In the absence of pathology within a few days the integrity of the tissue is restored without formation of a scar and the endometrium is able to respond appropriately to subsequent endocrine signals in preparation for establishment of pregnancy if fertilization occurs. Understanding mechanisms regulating scarless repair of the endometrium is important both for design of therapies which can treat conditions where this is aberrant (heavy menstrual bleeding, fibroids, endometriosis, Asherman's syndrome) as well as to provide new information that might allow us to reduce fibrosis and scar formation in other tissues. Menstruation only occurs naturally in species that exhibit spontaneous stromal cell decidualization during the fertile cycle such as primates (including women) and the Spiny mouse. To take advantage of genetic models and detailed time course analysis, mouse models of endometrial shedding/repair involving hormonal manipulation, artificial induction of decidualization and hormone withdrawal have been developed and refined. These models are useful in modeling dynamic changes across the time course of repair and have recapitulated key features of endometrial repair in women including local hypoxia and immune cell recruitment. In this review we will consider the evidence that scarless repair of endometrial tissue involves changes in stromal cell function including mesenchyme to epithelial transition, epithelial cell proliferation and multiple populations of immune cells. Processes contributing to endometrial fibrosis (Asherman's syndrome) as well as scarless repair of other tissues including skin and oral mucosa are compared to that of menstrual repair.",['Kirkwood PM; Shaw IW; Saunders PTK'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304046,"the human endometrium may experience up to 400 cycles of hormone-driven proliferation, differentiation and breakdown during a woman's reproductive lifetime. the endometrium is a remarkable tissue which may experience up to 400 cycles of hormone-driven proliferation, differentiation and breakdown during a woman's reproductive lifetime."
"Mother-daughter communication of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) matters and associated factors among sinhalese adolescent girls aged 14-19 years, in Sri Lanka.","School-based and community-based sexuality education has not shown a significant impact on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes of Sri Lankan adolescents. Parents, as the primary educators of adolescents, could potentially serve as better sources for providing individualized sexuality education to their children. To assess the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) topics discussed between mothers and daughters, barriers to communication, and associations of SRH communication among Sinhala adolescent girls aged 14-19 years in Sri Lanka. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 810 Sinhala adolescent girls using a pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics pertaining to mother-daughter communication in SRH matters were presented using frequencies and percentages. Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the association of selected socio-demographic factors with mother-daughter SRH communication, while binary logistic analysis was used to assess the independent association of chosen demographic factors with mother-daughter SRH communication. The majority of the respondents (67.1%, n = 540) indicated a willingness to discuss SRH matters with their mothers. For 78.2% (n = 632) of the respondents, the mother was the preferred source of SRH information. Common topics discussed between the mothers and daughters included issues related to menstruation (88.4%, n = 701) and maintaining personal boundaries (94%, n = 718), whereas less discussed topics included homosexuality (21%, n = 166), and preventing unwanted pregnancy (38.6%, n = 305). Cultural barriers, fear of mothers' reactions, and mothers' lack of confidence in responding to their daughter's SRH matters were the main barriers to discussing SRH topics with mothers. Adolescent girls' age, and family income level were significantly associated with mother-daughter SRH communication. Although a majority of adolescent girls preferred to share their sexual health concerns with their mothers, a notable barrier was the lack of confidence from the mother's side. Furthermore, the scope of mother-daughter sexual communication in this study was largely limited to less sensitive topics. In light of these findings, it is suggested that interventions targeted at parents be developed alongside school-based sex education for adolescents. These interventions should aim to enhance parents' knowledge and skills in discussing sexual health matters with their adolescent children.",['Mataraarachchi D; A PTE; Buddhika P K M; C VPVS'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37653416,"parents could potentially serve as better sources for providing individualized sexuality education to their children. a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 810 Sinhala adolescent girls using a pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire."
Comprehensive assessment of holding urine as a behavioral risk factor for UTI in women and reasons for delayed voiding.,"Women of reproductive age group have greater predilection to urinary tract infections (UTI). Various risk factors increase the prevalence in women. Emergence of multidrug resistant uropathogens make clinical management of UTI challenging. Here we assess holding of urine as risk factor of UTI in women and reasons for delayed voiding. We also investigate the relationship between frequency of UTIs and overall behavioural features, menstrual hygiene and attitude of women towards their own health issues. A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was performed with 816 hostel residents with written consent. Self-reported data was statistically analysed using SPSS software. Urinalysis and urine culture were done for 50 women by random sampling to obtain the information on leading causative agents of UTI in the study population and their antimicrobial resistance profile. The prevalence of UTI among the participants without risk factors was found to be 27.5 (95% CI: 24.4-30.7). Attitude of women towards their own personal health issues and use of public toilets showed a correlation with prevalence of infection. Delay in urination on habitual basis was found to be associated with UTI. Uropathogens isolated by random sampling were resistant to multiple drugs that are generally used to treat UTI. Holding urine for long time had proven to be an important risk factor and amongst different reasons of holding urine, holding due to poor sanitary condition of public toilets was the most common. Higher frequency of self-reported UTIs is related to holding of urine, behavioural features and attitude of women.",['Jagtap S; Harikumar S; Vinayagamoorthy V; Mukhopadhyay S; Dongre A'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35668379,women of reproductive age group have greater predilection to urinary tract infections (UTI) Various risk factors increase the prevalence in women.
The Long Non-Coding RNA Gene <i>AC027288.3</i> Plays a Role in Human Endometrial Stromal Fibroblast Decidualization.,"During the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, endometrial fibroblast cells begin to change into large epithelial-like cells called decidual cells in a process called decidualization. This differentiation continues more broadly in the endometrium and forms the decidual tissue during early pregnancy. The cells undergoing decidualization as well as the resulting decidual cells, support successful implantation and placentation during early pregnancy. This study was carried out to identify new potentially important long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes that may play a role in human endometrial stromal fibroblast cells (hESF) undergoing decidualization in vitro, and several were found. The expression of nine was further characterized. One of these, <i>AC027288.3</i>, showed a dramatic increase in the expression of hESF cells undergoing decidualization. When <i>AC027288.3</i> expression was targeted, the ability of the cells to undergo decidualization as determined by the expression of decidualization marker protein-coding genes was significantly altered. The most affected markers of decidualization whose expression was significantly reduced were <i>FOXO1</i>, <i>FZD4</i>, and <i>INHBA</i>. Therefore, <i>AC027288.3</i> may be a major upstream regulator of the WNT-FOXO1 pathway and activin-SMAD3 pathways previously shown as critical for hESF decidualization. Finally, we explored possible regulators of <i>AC027288.3</i> expression during human ESF decidualization. Expression was regulated by cAMP and progesterone. Our results suggest that <i>AC027288.3</i> plays a role in hESF decidualization and identifies several other lncRNA genes that may also play a role.",['Thapa R; Marmo K; Ma L; Torry DS; Bany BM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38727314,i>AC027288.3/i> plays a role in human endometrial stromal fibroblast cells. the long non-coding RNA gene plays a role in human endometrial stromal fibroblast cells undergoing decidualization in vitro.
The prevalence and correlates of unintended pregnancy among female sex workers in South China: a cross-sectional study.,"Female sex workers (FSW) are particularly vulnerable to unintended pregnancy. Research examining the experience of unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex among Chinese FSW, however, is limited. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex among FSW in China. In 2021, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1257 FSW in five cities from Guangdong provinces in South China. Data were collected on social-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, experience of unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex and its pregnancy outcome, as well as experience of abortion in lifetime. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with unintended pregnancy. Among the 1257 FSW, 19.3% reported having at least one unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex. Of those, 96.7% chose to terminate the pregnancy through induced abortion, and 40.5% reported undergoing multiple induced abortions in their lifetime. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that FSW working in current location over one year (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI 1.71-4.64) and having more than seven clients in the past week (aOR: 4.53, 95% CI 2.74-7.51) were more likely to have had unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex. Working in high tier (aOR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.30) and consistent condom use with clients in the past month (aOR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.23) were associated with a lower proportion of FSW having ever had unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy are prevalent among FSW in South China. Interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of unintended pregnancy and enhancing post-abortion care could be necessary among Chinese FSW.",['Liang P; Zhao P; Shi Y; Huang S; Wang C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39049096,female sex workers are particularly vulnerable to unintended pregnancy. research examining the experience of unintended pregnancy due to commercial sex among Chinese FSW in 2021.
Menstrual Equity Initiatives at USA Universities: A Multiple Case Study of Common Obstacles and Enabling Factors.,"<b>Background:</b> In recent years there has been growing momentum in the USA around addressing issues of ""menstrual equity"" and ""period poverty,"" including a proliferation of university-level initiatives seeking to provide access to free menstrual products. This multiple case study examined four such efforts at a diversity of tertiary institutions to identify the factors that facilitated or impeded success. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a qualitative multiple case study, including a desk review and key informant interviews with student and administrative actors from universities with free menstrual product initiatives. We sought to identify key learning regarding common challenges and obstacles, enabling factors which supported success and sustainability, and practical learning for future initiatives. From the desk review, four schools (<i>n</i> = 4) were purposively selected to represent a range of geographic regions, student population size, and university type. Purposive sampling was used to identify students and administrators engaged in the menstrual equity initiatives on each campus (<i>n</i> = 20; 4-6 per school). Data from the desk review and interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. <b>Results:</b> Key themes included (1) the critical role of champions, (2) the importance of social and financial support, (3) challenges diffusing menstrual equity from pilot to scale, and (4) recommendations for future initiatives. University initiatives varied greatly in terms of their scope, funding, and implementation strategy. <b>Conclusion:</b> This multiple case study provides valuable insights regarding the facilitating factors and obstacles faced by initiatives providing free menstrual products at universities. To date, these initiatives have proven successful across the four case studies; however, in most cases, the scope of the initiatives was constrained by limited resources and sustainability concerns. Future campus menstrual equity strategies would benefit from cross-institutional learning and dialogue highlighting design and implementation successes and challenges.",['Gruer C; Goss T; Schmitt ML; Sommer M'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304028,a multiple case study examined four initiatives at universities. the study examined key learning regarding common challenges and obstacles. the study examined four initiatives at tertiary institutions.
"Menstrual patterns and gynecologic morbidity among university students in Kano, Nigeria.","To examine menstrual patterns and effects of menstrual disorders on social and academic lives of undergraduate students in Kano, Nigeria. Students attending Bayero University Kano, Nigeria (n = 383). Self-administered questionnaires. Sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual patterns, and associated symptoms were elicited. Treatment-seeking behavior and effects of symptoms on academic and social activities were ascertained. The mean age at menarche was 13.7 ± 1.68 years. Menstrual bleeding lasted an average of 5.2 ± 1.6 days. Cycle length was 21-35 days in 92% of cases (n = 353). Approximately 72% of respondents reported dysmenorrhea. After adjusting for confounding, age at menarche, menstrual cycle length, duration of menstrual bleeding and use of contraceptive pills remained significant predictors of dysmenorrhea. Menstrual disorders interfered with social and academic life of 91% and 84% of respondents respectively. Gynecologic morbidity related to menstruation is common among adolescent Nigerians and is associated with detrimental effects on academic and social activities.

Ovarian hormones predict cooperative strategies updating during multiple rounds of the prisoner's dilemma.,"Increasing research has focused on how ovarian hormones influence individual prosocial motivation and cooperation. However, most results remain ambiguous and contradictory. Here, we collected progesterone (PROG) and oestradiol from 62 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles to explore whether variations in ovarian hormones could flexibly change their cooperative preference according to their opponents' strategies in multiple rounds of a prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. Participants in different menstrual phases (32 in the follicular phase [FP] and 30 in the luteal phase [LP]) were asked to complete 20 rounds of PD games with each of three computer opponents holding different cooperative strategies. The results revealed that in PD games that did not require cooperation for increased outcomes, women in the LP (high PROG) reduced their cooperation rate more significantly than women in the FP (low PROG). In contrast, when the game design required reciprocity, simultaneously elevated levels of PROG and oestradiol predicted greater instances of participants choosing to cooperate. Furthermore, we found that elevated PROG levels accounted for women's elevated prosocial choices, regardless of the need to increase outcomes through cooperation. These results implied higher levels of PROG and oestradiol influence women's cooperative strategies resulting in increased social interactions.",['Wang JX; Fu L; Lei Q; Zhuang JY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38759584,progesterone (PROG) and oestradiol from 62 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles were collected from 62 healthy women. participants in different menstrual phases were asked to complete 20 rounds of PD games with each of three computer opponents holding different cooperative strategies.
Association between Myometrial Thickness and Assisted Reproductive Technologies Outcomes: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Myometrial thickness has been expected to be a prognosticator for lower uterine segment function. An abnormal function of the uterine muscle layer can cause common and important reproductive problems. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between baseline myometrial thickness and assisted reproductive technologies (ART) outcomes. In this prospective cohort study, 453 infertile women undergoing ART cycles without any obvious uterine pathology, participated in this prospective cohort study from February 2013 to May 2015. In order to measure the myometrial thickness in the anterior and posterior of the uterine, trans-vaginal ultrasounds were conducted on days 2-4 of the cycle (menstrual phase) preceding ovarian stimulation and the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. We defined three groups based on the baseline myometrial thickness in the anterior and posterior, including (A) <25 mm, (B) 25-29.9 mm and (C) ≥30 mm. Ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and luteal phase support were performed in accordance with the standard long protocol. Two weeks after embryo transfer, the patients underwent a pregnancy test by checking their serum β-hCG levels. The primary outcome measure was clinical pregnancy rate. Secondary outcome measures were, implantation rate, abortion rate and live birth rate. The clinical pregnancy (P=0.013) and implantation (P=0.003) rates were significantly lower in group A than in two other groups. Although the live birth rate was lower in group A than two other groups, this decrease was not statistically significant (P=0.058). The findings may be a way for clinicians to draw focus on providing therapeutic strategies and a specific supportive care for women with a baseline myometrial thickness <25 mm in order to improve the reproductive outcome of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI).",['Madani T; Jahangiri N; Moosavisadat SM; Mirzaagha E; Maroufizadeh S; Irani S; Ahmadi F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38368514,myometrial thickness has been expected to be a prognosticator for lower uterine segment function. an abnormal function of the uterine muscle layer can cause common and important reproductive problems. 453 infertile women undergoing ART cycles without any obvious uterine pathology participated in this prospective cohort study from February 2013 to May 2015.
Association between maternal multimorbidity and neurodevelopment of offspring: a prospective birth cohort study from the Japan Environment and Children's Study.,"To investigate the association between multimorbidity during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental delay in offspring using data from a Japanese nationwide birth cohort study. This study was a prospective birth cohort study. This study population included 104 059 fetal records who participated in The Japan Environment and Children's Study from 2011 to 2014. Pregnant women whose children had undergone developmental testing were included in this analysis. Neurodevelopment of offspring was assessed using the Japanese version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition, comprising five developmental domains. The number of comorbidities among the pregnant women was categorised as zero, single disease or multimorbidity (two or more diseases). Maternal chronic conditions included in multimorbidity were defined as conditions with high prevalence among women of reproductive age. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between multimorbidity in pregnant women and offspring development. Pregnant women with multimorbidity, single disease and no disease accounted for 3.6%, 30.6% and 65.8%, respectively. The ORs for neurodevelopmental impairment during the follow-up period were similar for infants of mothers with no disease comorbidity and those with a single disease comorbidity. However, the ORs for neurodevelopmental impairment were significantly higher for children born to mothers with multimorbidity compared with those born to healthy mothers. An association was observed between the number of comorbidities in pregnant women and developmental delay in offspring. Multimorbidity in pregnant women may be associated with neurodevelopmental delay in their offspring. Further research is required in this regard in many other regions of the world.",['Akagi T; Saijo Y; Yoshioka E; Sato Y; Nakanishi K; Kato Y; Nagaya K; Takahashi S; Ito Y; Iwata H; Yamaguchi T; Miyashita C; Ito S; Kishi R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097305,prospective birth cohort study was a prospective birth cohort study. study population included 104 059 fetal records who participated in the study.
Role of stress and physical activity on primary dysmenorrhea: A cross-sectional study.,"The initial physiological change in adolescent girls is the onset of menstruation. The most prevalent challenge they face regarding menstruation is primary dysmenorrhea, characterized by persistent or intermittent pelvic pain in the lower abdomen. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of stress levels and physical activities on primary dysmenorrhea. A cross-sectional was conducted in Cirebon, Indonesia, in 2023 included young women who had never given birth (nullipara), aged 17-25 years old, had menstruated, and had no history of smoking and alcohol. The data were collected using a set of questionnaires consisting of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to determine primary dysmenorrhea pain, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 42 (DASS 42) to determine the level of stress and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to determine physical activity. Pearson's correlation test was used to assess the correlation between the variables (stress levels, physical activity, and dysmenorrhea). A total of 150 young women were included in the study. Moderate stress levels (23.3%) and high physical activity (90.7%) were the most prevalent category observed among studied participants. Approximately 42% of them experienced mild dysmenorrhea pain. Our analysis indicated that stress levels and physical activities had strong positive and negative correlations with dysmenorrhea pain levels, with <i>r</i>=0.782 and <i>r</i>=-0.748, respectively, with both had <i>p</i><0.001.

Revisiting hemochromatosis: genetic <i>vs.</i> phenotypic manifestations.,"Iron overload disorders represent an important class of human diseases. Of the primary iron overload conditions, by far the most common and best studied is HFE-related hemochromatosis, which results from homozygosity for a mutation leading to the C282Y substitution in the HFE protein. This disease is characterized by reduced expression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, leading to increased dietary iron absorption and iron deposition in multiple tissues including the liver, pancreas, joints, heart and pituitary. The phenotype of HFE-related hemochromatosis is quite variable, with some individuals showing little or no evidence of increased body iron, yet others showing severe iron loading, tissue damage and clinical sequelae. The majority of genetically predisposed individuals show at least some evidence of iron loading (increased transferrin saturation and serum ferritin), but a minority show clinical symptoms and severe consequences are rare. Thus, the disorder has a high biochemical penetrance, but a low clinical prevalence. Nevertheless, it is such a common condition in Caucasian populations (1:100-200) that it remains an important clinical entity. The phenotypic variability can largely be explained by a range of environmental, genetic and physiological factors. Men are far more likely to manifest significant disease than women, with the latter losing iron through menstrual blood loss and childbirth. Other forms of blood loss, immune system influences, the amount of bioavailable iron in the diet and lifestyle factors such as high alcohol intake can also contribute to iron loading and disease expression. Polymorphisms in a range of genes have been linked to variations in body iron levels, both in the general population and in hemochromatosis. Some of the genes identified play well known roles in iron homeostasis, yet others are novel. Other factors, including both co-morbidities and genetic polymorphisms, do not affect iron levels <i>per se</i>, but determine the propensity for tissue pathology.",['Anderson GJ; Bardou-Jacquet E'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33987429,iron overload disorders represent an important class of human diseases. the most common and best studied is HFE-related hemochromatosis. the disease is characterized by reduced expression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin.
Comparative Analysis of Legislation on Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy: Italy's position relate to international panorama.,"The voluntary interruption of pregnancy (VIP) remains one of the most contentious issues worldwide, subject to different legal frameworks and cultural interpretations. Access to VIP is considered a fundamental right for women, recognized by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and supported by the United Nations. It is estimated that 40-50 million abortions are performed each year, of which about 75% are in developing countries. IVG is legal in only 25 countries, while in the others, it is severely restricted or illegal, leading to an increase in risky and illegal practices. We consulted government and ministerial websites in European countries to gather data on current abortion laws. In addition, scientific articles and legislative documents compare regulations across some countries, especially from 2020 to today, analyzing differences, similarities and implications. Percentage data on the number of abortions in several European countries, including Italy, were analyzed. Our analysis revealed significant differences in abortion laws between European countries. In many countries, abortion is allowed at the request of the woman within a certain gestational age limit, which typically ranges between 10 and 24 weeks. However, in some countries, the restrictions are much stricter, with limitations making access to legal abortion very difficult or impossible. In conclu-sion, the Italian experience highlights the importance of considering local sociocultural dynamics in shaping IVG policies and highlights the need for an evidence-based approach to guarantee women right to reproductive health internationally, surrounding reproductive rights, gender equality, and public health policy.","[""Pellegrini L; Sorace L; Tortorella V; Baggio U; De Paola L; D'Antonio G; La Russa R; Frati P""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39054994,the voluntary interruption of pregnancy is one of the most contentious issues worldwide. access to VIP is considered a fundamental right for women. it is estimated that 40-50 million abortions are performed each year.
"Knowledge of symptoms and risk factors of breast cancer among women: a community based study in a low socio-economic area of Mumbai, India.","Breast cancer (BC) is leading cancer among women in India accounting for 27% of all cancers among women. Factors that make the policymakers and public health system worried are rising incidence of breast cancer in India and more importantly high death rates among breast cancer patients. One of the leading causes of high breast cancer deaths is lack of awareness and screening leading to the late presentation at an advanced stage. Therefore, the current research aimed to understand the knowledge of breast cancer symptoms and risk factors among women in a low socio-economic area of Mumbai. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Prabhadevi, Mumbai and primary data was collected from 480 women aged 18-55 years. Structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data pertaining to awareness, signs and symptoms of breast cancer. Bivariate and multivariate regression techniques were used for understanding of the socio-demographic differentials in breast cancer awareness among women. The study found that around half (49%) of the women were aware of breast cancer. The women who were aware of breast cancer considered lump in breast (75%), change in shape and size of breast (57%), lump under armpit (56%), pain in one breast (56%) as the important and common symptoms. Less than one-fifth of the women who were aware of breast cancer reported early menstruation (5.6%), late menopause (10%), hormone therapy (13%), late pregnancy (15%) and obesity (19%) as the risk factors for breast cancer. The multivariate regression analysis showed women who had more than 10 years of schooling (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 3.93, CI: 2.57-6.02, P < 0.01) were about 4 times more likely to be aware of breast cancer than women who had less than 10 years of schooling. In conclusion, knowledge of danger signs and risk factors of breast cancer were low among women in the community. This may lead to late detection of breast cancer among women in the community. Therefore, the study calls for advocacy and larger intervention to enhance knowledge of breast cancer among women in the particular region with a special reference to women with low education.",['Prusty RK; Begum S; Patil A; Naik DD; Pimple S; Mishra G'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32423488,breast cancer is leading cancer among women in india accounting for 27% of all cancers among women. factors that make policymakers and public health system worried are rising incidence of breast cancer in India.
Economic burden of symptomatic iron deficiency - a survey among Swiss women.,"Symptomatic iron deficiency (ID) is a disorder affecting 10-20% of menstruating women. ID is diagnosed by measuring serum ferritin, a protein helping to store iron in the body. A deeper understanding of the association between ID and its societal and economic burden is relevant for patients, physicians, health care decision makers. An online household survey was carried out among Swiss women aged 18-50 years suffering from debilitating symptoms due to ID. The data was population-weighted for age and region. The costs of misdiagnosis and the ID-related economic burden (i.e. days of sick leave) from productivity losses on the labor market were determined and extrapolated to the Swiss population. Furthermore, the patient burden was assessed based on quality of life daily measurements. The total sample included 1010 women who received an ID diagnosis with a blood test in the last 2 years (mean age: 33.5 years). Most named symptoms were ""being tired or exhausted"" (96.4%) and reduced physical energy level (41.0%). In total, 354 (35.0% of the total sample) patients received an initial diagnosis other than ID. Of those, 46.8% were treated prior to the ID diagnosis with a pharmacological medical therapy or psychotherapy. Extrapolating these numbers to the Swiss female population aged 18-50 years, the direct medical costs would be CHF 78 million (assuming an annual ID incidence of ID diagnosis of 9.5%). On average, 28.5% of participants in the work-force had to take sick leave due to ID symptoms within a period of 2 years (mean: 5.2 days, i.e. 2.6 days/year). The estimated annual indirect costs in Switzerland would be CHF 33 million (human capital approach) or CHF 26 million (friction cost method), respectively. Being exhausted and impaired concentration appear to be the most important factors negatively impacting daily living and hence quality of life. The societal and economic burden among women due to debilitating symptoms of ID in Switzerland is substantial. Timely, correct diagnosis and treatment of ID may contribute to reducing this burden. Further studies are needed in this area to validate our results.",['Blank PR; Tomonaga Y; Szucs TD; Schwenkglenks M'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30808368,"symptomatic iron deficiency (ID) is a disorder affecting 10-20% of menstruating women. it is diagnosed by measuring serum ferritin, a protein helping to store iron in the body. an online household survey was carried out among Swiss women suffering from debilitating symptoms due to ID."
Menstrual Pattern among Unmarried Women from Northern India.,"Menstruation disorders are also responsible for emotional, physical, behavioural and dietary practice changes. These changes affect their normal functioning and social life. The present study was carried out to find the prevalence of menstrual problems among unmarried girls of Chandigarh, India and to compare their knowledge and beliefs regarding menstruation in different sub-groups. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 744 unmarried females in Rural, Urban and Slum strata of UT Chandigarh, India. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire on menstruation. Chi-square value was used for testing statistical significance. The mean age of the respondents was 16.84±3.05 years. Maximum respondents (40.9%) were educated up to 10th standard/High school. 448 (60.2%) were aware of menstruation before starting of menarche. Awareness was found to be significantly associated (p=0.02) with age. Socio-economic status and prior knowledge of respondents was also found to be significantly associated (p< 0.001). 61% (454) of the respondents had a regular flow during menses. Normal flow was reported by 70.2 %(522) of the respondents. Dysmenorrhea was found to be the most common problem suffered by 429 (57.7%) respondents.

Ultrasensitive detection of aggregated α-synuclein using quiescent seed amplification assay for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Seed amplification assays (SAA) enable the amplification of pathological misfolded proteins, including α-synuclein (αSyn), in both tissue homogenates and body fluids of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. SAA involves repeated cycles of shaking or sonication coupled with incubation periods. However, this amplification scheme has limitations in tracking protein propagation due to repeated fragmentation. We introduced a modified form of SAA, known as Quiescent SAA (QSAA), and evaluated biopsy and autopsy samples from individuals clinically diagnosed with PD and those without synucleinopathies (control group). Brain biopsy samples were obtained from 14 PD patients and 6 controls without synucleinopathies. Additionally, skin samples were collected from 214 PD patients and 208 control subjects. Data were analyzed from April 2019 to May 2023. QSAA successfully amplified αSyn aggregates in brain tissue sections from mice inoculated with pre-formed fibrils. In the skin samples from 214 PD cases and 208 non-PD cases, QSAA demonstrated high sensitivity (90.2%) and specificity (91.4%) in differentiating between PD and non-PD cases. Notably, more αSyn aggregates were detected by QSAA compared to immunofluorescence with the pS129-αSyn antibody in consecutive slices of both brain and skin samples. We introduced the new QSAA method tailored for in situ amplification of αSyn aggregates in brain and skin samples while maintaining tissue integrity, providing a streamlined approach to diagnosing PD with individual variability.

"Determinants of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and associated factors among regular undergraduate students at Hawassa University Southern, Ethiopia, 2023: institution-based cross-sectional study.","Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition causing severe emotional, physical, and behavioral symptoms before menstruation. It greatly hinders daily activities, affecting academic and interpersonal relationships. Attention is not given to premenstrual disorders among female students in higher education. As a result, students are susceptible to stress, and their academic success is influenced by various factors, including their menstrual cycle, and the long-term outcomes and consequences are poorly researched. Even though PMDD has a significant negative impact on student's academic achievement and success limited research has been conducted in low- and middle-income countries including Ethiopia, especially in the study setting. Therefore, a study is needed to assess premenstrual dysphoric disorder and associated factors among regular undergraduate students at Hawassa University. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 374 regular undergraduate female students at Hawassa University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences. A self-administered structured premenstrual symptoms screening tool for adolescents was used to assess premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The collected data were loaded into a statistical package for the social science version 25 and analyzed using it. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Each independent variable was entered separately into bivariate analysis, and a variable with a p-value less than 0.25 were included in the multivariate analysis to adjust the possible confounders. Statistically significant was declared at a 95% confidence interval when variable with a p-value less than 0.05 in the multivariate analysis with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The magnitude of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in this study was 62.6% (95% CI 57.4-67.5). Having severe premenstrual pain (AOR = 6.44;95%CI 1.02-40.73), having irregular menstrual cycle (AOR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.32-3.70), students who had poor social support (AOR = 5.10;95%CI, (2.76-12.92) and moderate social support (AOR = 4.93;95%CI (2.18-11.18), and students who used contraception (AOR = 3.76;95%CI, 2.21-6,40) were statistically significant factors with the outcome variable. The prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder was high as compared to other studies. There was a strong link between irregular menstrual cycle, severe menstrual pain (severe dysmenorrhea), poor social support, and contraception use with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This needs early screening and intervention to prevent the complications and worsening of the symptoms that affect students' academic performance by the institution.",['Chekol AT; Reta Y; Ayinewa F; Hailu L; Tesema M; Wale MA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38783237,"premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition causing severe emotional, physical, and behavioral symptoms before menstruation. it greatly hinders daily activities, affecting academic and interpersonal relationships."
Age-specific differences in women with implantable cardioverter defibrillators: an international multi center study.,"Common psychological adjustment difficulties have been identified for groups of implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients, such as those who are young (<50 years old), have been shocked, and are female. Specific aspects and concerns, such as fears of death or shock and body image concerns, that increase the chance of distress, have not been examined in different aged female implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients. The aim of the study was to investigate these areas of adjustment across three age groups of women from multiple centers. Eighty-eight female ICD patients were recruited at three medical centers: Shands Hospital at the University of Florida, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia. Women completed individual psychological assessment batteries, measuring the constructs of shock anxiety, death anxiety, and body image concerns. Medical record review was conducted for all patients regarding cardiac illnesses and ICD-specific data. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance revealed that younger women reported significantly higher rates of shock and death anxiety (Pillai's F=3.053, P=0.018, eta2p=0.067) and significantly greater body image concerns (Pillai's F=4.198, P=0.018, eta2p=0.090) than middle- and older-aged women. Women under the age of 50 appear to be at greater risk for the development of psychosocial distress associated with shock anxiety, death anxiety, and body image. Clinical-based strategies and interventions targeting these types of adjustment difficulties in younger women may allow for improved psychosocial and quality of life outcomes.",['Vazquez LD; Kuhl EA; Shea JB; Kirkness A; Lemon J; Whalley D; Conti JB; Sears SF'],2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19067804,common psychological adjustment difficulties have been identified for groups of implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients. the aim of the study was to investigate these areas of adjustment across three age groups of women from multiple centers.
Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in dysmenorrhea: a systematic review of effectiveness.,"To assess the effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. Data sources. The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (9 June 2004), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to Nov. 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Nov. 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Oct. 2003), MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, the citation lists of review articles and included trials, and contact with the corresponding author of each included trial. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of uterosacral nerve ablation or presacral neurectomy (both open and laparoscopic procedures) for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. The main outcome measures were pain relief and adverse effects. Two reviewers extracted data on characteristics of the study quality and the population, intervention, and outcome independently. Nine randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review. There were two trials with open presacral neurectomy; all other trials used laparoscopic techniques. For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation at 12 months was better when compared to a control or no treatment (OR 6.12; 95% CI 1.78-21.03). The comparison of laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation with presacral neurectomy for primary dysmenorrhea showed that at 12 months follow-up, presacral neurectomy was more effective (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.03-0.32). In secondary dysmenorrhea, along with laparoscopic surgical treatment of endometriosis, the addition of laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation did not improve the pain relief (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.43-1.39), while presacral neurectomy did (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.59-6.21). Adverse events were more common for presacral neurectomy than procedures without presacral neurectomy (OR 14.6; 95% CI 5-42.5). The evidence for nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhea is limited. Methodologically sound and sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are needed.",['Latthe PM; Proctor ML; Farquhar CM; Johnson N; Khan KS'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17230282,systematic review of effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. uterosacral nerve ablation or presacral neurectomy was better when compared to a control or no treatment.
Measuring the prevalence and impact of poor menstrual hygiene management: a quantitative survey of schoolgirls in rural Uganda.,"The primary objective was to describe Ugandan schoolgirls' menstrual hygiene management (MHM) practices and estimate the prevalence of inadequate MHM. Second, to assess the relative contribution of aspects of MHM to health, education and psychosocial outcomes. Secondary analysis of survey data collected as part of the final follow-up from a controlled trial of reusable sanitary pad and puberty education provision was used to provide a cross-sectional description of girls' MHM practices and assess relationships with outcomes. Rural primary schools in the Kamuli district, Uganda. Participants were 205 menstruating schoolgirls (10-19 years) from the eight study sites. The prevalence of adequate MHM, consistent with the concept definition, was estimated using dimensions of absorbent used, frequency of absorbent change, washing and drying procedures and privacy. Self-reported health, education (school attendance and engagement) and psychosocial (shame, insecurity, embarrassment) outcomes hypothesised to result from poor MHM were assessed as primary outcomes. Outcomes were measured through English surveys loaded on iPads and administered verbally in the local language. 90.5% (95% CI 85.6% to 93.9%) of girls failed to meet available criteria for adequate MHM, with no significant difference between those using reusable sanitary pads (88.9%, 95% CI 79.0% to 94.4%) and those using existing methods, predominantly cloth (91.5%, 95% CI 85.1% to 95.3%; χ<sup>2</sup> (1)=0.12, p=0.729). Aspects of MHM predicted some consequences including shame, not standing in class to answer questions and concerns about odour. This study was the first to assess the prevalence of MHM consistent with the concept definition. Results suggest that when all aspects of menstrual hygiene are considered together, the prevalence is much higher than has previously been reported based on absorbents alone. The work demonstrates an urgent need for improved assessment and reporting of MHM, and for primary research testing the links between menstrual management and health, education and psychosocial consequences.",['Hennegan J; Dolan C; Wu M; Scott L; Montgomery P'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28039290,"quantitative survey of schoolgirls in rural Uganda. primary objective was to describe schoolgirls' menstrual hygiene management practices. a third was to assess the relative contribution of aspects of MHM to health, education and psychosocial outcomes."

Murine modeling of menstruation identifies immune correlates of protection during <i>Chlamydia muridarum</i> challenge.,"The menstrual cycle influences the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (<i>C. trachomatis</i>), although the underlying immune contributions are poorly defined. A mouse model simulating the immune-mediated process of menstruation could provide valuable insights into tissue-specific determinants of protection against chlamydial infection within the cervicovaginal and uterine mucosae comprising the female reproductive tract (FRT). Here, we used the pseudopregnancy approach in naïve C57Bl/6 mice and performed vaginal challenge with <i>Chlamydia muridarum</i> (<i>C. muridarum</i>) at decidualization, endometrial tissue remodeling, or uterine repair. This strategy identified that the time frame comprising uterine repair correlated with robust infection and greater bacterial burden as compared with mice on hormonal contraception, while challenges during endometrial remodeling were least likely to result in a productive infection. By comparing the infection site at early time points following chlamydial challenge, we found that a greater abundance of innate effector populations and proinflammatory signaling, including IFNγ correlated with protection. FRT immune profiling in uninfected mice over pseudopregnancy or in pig-tailed macaques over the menstrual cycle identified NK cell infiltration into the cervicovaginal tissues and lumen over the course of endometrial remodeling. Notably, NK cell depletion over this time frame reversed protection, with mice now productively infected with <i>C. muridarum</i> following challenge. This study shows that the pseudopregnancy murine menstruation model recapitulates immune changes in the FRT as a result of endometrial remodeling and identifies NK cell localization at the FRT as essential for immune protection against primary <i>C. muridarum</i> infection.",['Lawrence LA; Vidal P; Varughese RS; Tiger Li ZR; Chen TD; Tuske SC; Jimenez AR; Lowen AC; Shafer WM; Swaims-Kohlmeier A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38826233,a mouse model simulating the immune-mediated process of menstruation could provide valuable insights into tissue-specific determinants of protection against chlamydial infection. the menstrual cycle influences the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Overwintering under ice: A novel observation for an Australian freshwater turtle.,"Frozen water bodies provide a physiological challenge to fauna by physically limiting access to atmospheric oxygen. To tolerate low temperatures, reptiles use brumation as a physiological strategy in winter. Cryptodira vary in their tolerance to freezing conditions but the extent of tolerance in pleurodirans is largely unknown. Australia's freshwater turtles inhabit warmer regions with less severe winters and have well-developed mechanisms to cope with high temperatures and drying waterbodies, rather than extreme cold tolerance. <i>Chelodina longicollis</i> is a widespread Australian freshwater turtle species that tolerates high temperatures and desiccation during hot, dry periods while also undergoing brumation during winter months. Despite extensive research, limited observations exist on their behaviour during severe winter periods at the extremes of their range. In an 11-month tracking study, we monitored adult <i>C. longicollis</i>, noting their movements, locations, and temperature weekly. We observed an adult female <i>C. longicollis</i> which, during a seven-month period within a single creek pool, survived brumation in extreme cold water including a 15-day period of total freezing of the surface water. After the ice melted following a rain event, the turtle was recaptured alive. This marks the first observation of brumation for an Australian chelid species under ice.",['Dowling J; Bower DS; Nordberg EJ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39011131,a new observation for an australian freshwater turtle. brumation is a physiological strategy to tolerate low temperatures. a chelid species is a common species of turtles.
An update on approved and emerging drugs for the treatment of postpartum depression.,"<p>Depression, anxiety and psychotic disorders are common perinatal mental health disorders in the postpartum period. Depressive symptoms that occur postpartum are also present in the prenatal period in 50% of patients. Risk factors for the development of postpartum depression include poor relationship with the partner, lack of social support, mother&rsquo;s low socioeconomic status and multiparity. It has been determined that reproductive hormones change significantly during peripartum. Progesterone is one of these hormones and acts on the central nervous system starting from the fetal period; neurogenesis, neuromodulation, sedation are some of these effects. It has also been observed that progesterone has positive effects on learning, memory and mood. Progesterone exerts its effects on the central nervous system by converting into its metabolite allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone is one of the neuroactive steroids, and found in similar amounts in the circulation of pregnant women and fetuses. It acts on synaptic and extrasynaptic &gamma;-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors and is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Allopregnanolone increases both the receptor&rsquo;s opening frequency and its open duration and improves GABAergic current. Low serum allopregnanolone levels in the second trimester are predictive of postpartum depression. Each 1 ng/mL increase in serum allopregnanolone level reduces the risk of development of postpartum depression by 63%. Brexanolone and zuranolone are synthetic allopregnanolone preparations approved by the FDA for use in female patients with postpartum depression. They act via positive allosteric modulation on the GABAA receptor. Brexanolone is administered via intravenous infusion at varying infusion rates in a healthcare facility over 60 hours. Its effect starts immediately after treatment and continues until the 30th day of follow-up, and depressive mood does not recur. Zuranolone was developed for oral use, and administered as a single dose of 50 mg after a fatty meal. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The development of other novel agents that act on the GABAA receptor and other pathways for the treatment of postpartum depression is in progress.</p>.",['Çulcu EA; Demiryürek Ş; Demiryürek AT'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082257,postpartum depression is common perinatal mental health disorders. depressive symptoms are present in the prenatal period in 50% of patients.
Quantifying the Impact of Dysmenorrhea Symptoms on Quality-of-Life and Access to Oral Contraceptives by Income.,"Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstrual periods, is one of the most common gynecological complaints. Most reports of uterine contractions range between moderate to severe pain, and patients often elect to cope with their discomfort without assistance from a physician. In the process, women experiencing dysmenorrhea are more likely to report absenteeism from work and school. This study measures the reported impact of dysmenorrhea on patients' lives and elucidates a relationship between income and access to oral contraceptives. Two hundred women completed a survey about their symptoms, level of pain, treatments, and the extent to which dysmenorrhea affected day-to-day obligations. Most questions were multiple-choice while others permitted several answer selections or were free response. The data was analyzed using JMP statistical software. Eighty-four percent of respondents reported moderate to severe pain during menstruation. This discomfort has caused 65.5% of the cohort to miss work and 68% to avoid participating in social gatherings. Pain relief medications are most often used as treatment - 143 respondents took ibuprofen, 93 took acetaminophen, and 51 took naproxen. 29.5% of respondents are prescribed birth control for cramps and blood flow. Income (p = 0.049), age (p = 0.002), and education (p = 0.002) were significant predictors for oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use. The lowest income groups were found to use OCPs at less than half the rate as the highest income respondents. Dysmenorrhea affected most participants in the cohort with an impact that extends beyond professional obligations. Income was found to be positively correlated with increased OCP use, whereas education level was inversely correlated. Clinicians should consider how patients' backgrounds influence their access to OCP options. An improvement on this study's findings would be to establish a causal relationship between these demographic factors and access to OCPs.",['Choksey R; Mangal RK; Stead TS; Jones T; Flores R; Ganti L'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37405315,dysmenorrhea is one of the most common gynecological complaints. most reports of uterine contractions range between moderate to severe pain. women experiencing dysmenorrhea are more likely to report absenteeism from work and school.
Deciphering the role of PGRMC2 in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle and in vitro decidualization using an in vitro approach.,"What is the human endometrial non-classical progesterone receptor (PGR) membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) expression pattern throughout the menstrual cycle and what role does it play during decidualization? Endometrial PGRMC2 expression fluctuates during the human menstrual cycle and is abundantly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells (hEnSCs) during in vitro decidualization, process where PGRMC2 is involved in embryo implantation-related pathways. The endometrial response to progesterone is mediated by the classical and non-classical PGRs. We previously demonstrated that PGR membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is critical for endometrial function, embryo implantation, and future placentation, however, the role(s) of PGRMC2, which is structurally similar to PGRMC1, have not been studied in the human endometrium. This prospective study comprehensively evaluated the endometrial expression of PGRMC2 throughout the human menstrual cycle and during in vitro decidualization of hEnSCs (isolated from 77 endometrial biopsies that were collected from 66 oocyte donors), using immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, western blot, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. In addition, functional analysis was carried out to validate the implication of PGRMC2 in hEnSCs during embryo invasion using an in vitro outgrowth model. In vitro decidualization of hEnSCs was induced using co-treatment with cAMP and medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate progestin, and evaluated by measuring prolactin by ELISA and F-actin immunostaining. RT-qPCR was employed to compare expression with other PGRs. To reveal the function of PGRMC2 during the decidualization process, we specifically knocked down PGRMC2 with siRNAs and performed RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics techniques (SWATH-MS). The common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) were considered for downstream functional enrichment analysis. Finally, to verify its implication in the trophoblast invasion, an outgrowth model was carried out where hEnSCs with silenced PGRMC2 were co-cultured with human trophoblastic spheroids (JEG-3) following in vitro decidualization. In contrast to PGRMC1 and classical PGRs, endometrial PGRMC2 gene expression was significantly lower during the late- versus mid-secretory phase (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the elevated PGRMC2 protein abundance observed in the endometrial epithelial glands throughout the menstrual cycle dropped in the late secretory phase, when abundance decreased in all endometrial compartments. Nevertheless, PGRMC2 protein increased during the mid-secretory phase in stromal and glandular cells, and PGRMC2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein (P < 0.001) levels were significantly enhanced in the membranes/organelles of decidualized hEnSCs, compared to non-decidualized hEnSCs. Notably, PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 mRNA were significantly more abundant than classical PGRs throughout menstrual cycle phases and in decidualized and non-decidualized hEnSCs (P < 0.05). RNA-seq and proteomics data revealed 4687 DEGs and 28 DEPs, respectively, in decidualized hEnSCs after PGRMC2 silencing. While functional enrichment analysis showed that the 2420 upregulated genes were mainly associated with endoplasmic reticulum function, vesicular transport, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell adhesion, the 2267 downregulated genes were associated with aerobic respiration and protein biosynthesis. The protein enrichment analysis showed that 4 upregulated and 24 downregulated proteins were related to aerobic respiration, cellular response, metabolism, localization of endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and ribonucleoside biosynthesis routes. Finally, PGRMC2 knockdown significantly compromised the ability of the decidualized hEnSCs to support trophoblast expansion in an outgrowth model (P < 0.05). Transcriptomic data are available via NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under GEO Series accession number GSE251843 and proteomic data via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD048494. The functional analyses were limited by the discrete number of human endometrial biopsies. A larger sample size is required to further investigate the potential role(s) of PGRMC2 during embryo implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Further, the results obtained in the present work should be taken with caution, as the use of a pure primary endometrial stromal population differentiated in vitro does not fully represent the heterogeneity of the endometrium in vivo, nor the paracrine communications occurring between the distinct endometrial cell types. The repression of endometrial PGRMC2 during the late- versus mid-secretory phase, together with its overexpression during decidualization and multiple implications with embryo implantation not only highlighted the unknown roles of PGRMC2 in female reproduction but also the potential to exploit PGRMC2 signaling pathways to improve assisted reproduction treatments in the future.

Testosterone and Prolactin Perturbations Possibly Associated with Reduced Levels of β-Arrestin1 in Mononuclear Leukocytes of Women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.,"Previously, we reported that a reduction in β-Arrestin1 protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMC) significantly correlated with the severity of depression symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This study aimed to determine whether the reduced premenstrual β-Arrestin1 protein levels were associated with changes in the regulator for late luteal phase progesterone secretion. The study participants (<i>n</i> = 25) were non-pregnant women between 18 and 42 years of age not taking any antidepressants or receiving therapy and experiencing the luteal phase of menstruation. ELISA determined the β-Arrestin1 protein in PBMC; testosterone and prolactin levels from the plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay. Reduced levels of β-Arrestin1 protein in women with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) scores above 19 were observed alongside significantly higher plasma testosterone and prolactin concentrations. Understanding the mechanism underlying the initiation of PMDD will allow for identification of a key perturbed metabolic enzyme that can serve as a target for drug development to ensure the alleviation of PMDD, which has been suggested earlier as a risk factor for developing major depressive disorders.",['Nayyar S; Archibong A; Nayyar T'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37895130,#NAME?
Personal and professional development activity tracking in a pharmacy curriculum.,"Personal and professional development (PPD) is an essential focus of pharmacy school curriculum in developing future pharmacists. This manuscript describes the creation, implementation, and data collection of a PPD Activity Tracker in a pharmacy curriculum. Previously, in ""Standards 2016"" and currently in ""Standards 2025"", colleges of pharmacy are tasked with documenting how students achieve PPD throughout their academic careers. Therefore, the PPD course directors developed a PPD Activities Tracker to provide student pharmacists a central location to document curriculum and co-curricular activities as they matriculate through the pharmacy program. The tracker was created using an electronic survey platform. Eleven activity categories were established, and students noted whether the activity was directed toward personal and/or professional development. The purpose of the tracker was to create a repository for student documentation of their PPD-promoting experiences and to provide a mechanism for individual and cohort reporting for assessment and accreditation. Student pharmacists from two class cohorts entered 3254 PPD activities into the tracker over a two-year period. All PPD categories were tracked with the highest attended activities, including personal development & self-care (19%) and self-reflection (19%); the next highest category was interprofessional education/collaboration (15%). Students noted that most PPD activities enhanced their personal and professional development (49%), while personal development only and professional development only were 31% and 19%, respectively. The students ""highly recommended"" (72%) most tracked PPD activities, while 26% of activities were ""recommended."" Individual student and class cohort data were also readily accessible. The PPD tracker created a central, easily accessible, and organized storehouse for successfully collecting curricular and co-curricular PPD activities throughout the student pharmacist's career. The data from this tracker could easily be collected and sorted individually as a class cohort or for an individual student pharmacist.",['Pound MW; Barnes CL; Perkins SL; Thornhill TH'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116696,a PPD Activity Tracker was created using an electronic survey platform. the tracker was created to provide a central location for student pharmacists. the tracker was created using an electronic survey platform.
Period during a pandemic: The neglected reality of Nigerian girls and women.,"Underneath the façade of supposedly bubbly girls, living daily lives in many parts of Nigeria lies the problem of lack of access to proper menstrual hygiene management tools or kits. From schools to business places, religious organizations amongst others, a hive of women and girls face the harsh reality of inability to manage their periods due to poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, common in many low- and middle-income countries of which Nigeria sits top. The issue of privacy and dignity during menstruation is still one area in which women and girls in Nigeria are failed every day. All of these further taking a toll on the emotional life, education, productivity of the girl child amongst others. The pandemic further impedes the ability/efforts of non-governmental organizations hitherto saddled with the responsibility of tutoring young girls in mostly rural and underserved communities the art of making re-useable pads to address the challenge of period poverty. Deep-seated Menstrual taboos, common among many Nigerian tribes have also served as major setbacks to proper menstrual hygiene management. With all of these, the period poverty struggle, made worse by poor water sanitation and hygiene facilities in Nigerian communities continues. There is still an urgent need to increase sensitization, and advocacy to break menstrual taboos, reduce cost and improve access to menstrual hygiene products and facilities especially following the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant overbearing effects.",['Odey GO; Amusile O; Oghenetejiri PO; David S; Adi A; Lucero-Prisno DE'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36101630,a pandemic of women and girls in many parts of Nigeria is a hive of women and girls. the problem of inability to manage their periods is still one area in which women and girls are failed every day. the issue of privacy and dignity during menstruation is still one area in which women and girls in Nigeria are failed every day.
Examining corporate support issues with health literacy as a key factor: The Case of a Hiroshima corporation.,"Given the dramatic decline in Japan's labor force, promoting women's participation in the workforce is essential. We aimed to take a Hiroshima company as an example and analyze the influencing factors of health literacy (HL) to clarify the issues of the active participation of female employees. From February to March 2023, a cross-sectional study was conducted by a company in Hiroshima prefecture that contained many male employees. A total of 1,114 valid respondents were received. Employees' demographics, menstrual-related concerns, women's activity promotion support, and HL were investigated in this study. The Chi-square test and logistic regression using SPSS statistical software version 25 were used. There were significant differences between high and low HL with age, women's menstrual problems, and women's activity promotion support. The participants who were unaware of women's menstrual-related problems and their company's implementation of women's activity promotion support were more likely to have high HL. In addition, female employees (including female management) and male management have significantly different cognitions about women's activity promotion support. This study found that overall HL among employees in male-dominated companies is low, even among participants who were aware of women's menstruation-related health issues and the company's women's activity promotion support. Increased women's representation in management can bridge policy perception gaps. Male-dominated companies should enhance HL via career programs, health education, and improved communication for active female engagement.",['Li Y; Kawasaki H; Yamasaki S; Nakaoka S; Shiraishi M; Cui Z'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38361877,a study was conducted by a company in Hiroshima prefecture. the study examined the influencing factors of health literacy. the study found that overall HL among employees in male-dominated companies is low.
Higher rating of perceived exertion and lower perceived recovery following a graded exercise test during menses compared to non-bleeding days in untrained females.,"The underrepresentation of the female population in exercise sciences could be attributed, at least in part, to difficulty in appropriately accounting for the effects of the menstrual cycle (MC). Previous studies examining the effects of the MC on aerobic performance and subjective measures of aerobic performance show conflicting results. <b>Purpose:</b> The study examined how the MC affects the objective and subjective measures of aerobic performance within untrained female participants and in comparison with untrained male participants assessed at similar time intervals. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-one participants (12 females and 9 males) completed a graded exercise test (GXT) on a cycle ergometer. The female participants were tested during their early follicular (EF; menses), ovulatory (O), and mid-luteal (ML) phases of the MC. The male participants were included as the control group and were randomly assigned to a menstrual cycle phase for each visit. During GXT, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>), peak blood lactate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were determined. Twenty-four hours post-exercise, the perceived recovery status (PRS) was assessed. The MC phase was estimated using basal body temperature (BBT) in the female participants. <b>Results:</b> The male participants obtained a higher peak power and VO<sub>2max</sub> compared to the female participants (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All objective measures of aerobic performance did not significantly differ across the MC phases or time points that were tested. In the untrained female participants, an effect of the MC phase on RPE was found, with RPE being higher at EF (8.92 ± 0.79) compared to O (7.67 ± 1.23; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and ML (7.75 ± 1.06; <i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, an effect of the MC phase on PRS was found, with perceived recovery being lower at EF (6.83 ± 0.94) compared to O (8.83 ± 1.12) and ML (8.67 ± 0.65; all <i>p</i> < 0.005) for the untrained female participants. No significant differences in RPE and PRS were found between tests in the untrained male participants. The female participants had lower perceived recovery following EF (6.83 ± 0.94) compared with the male participants (9.00 ± 1.00; <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The untrained female participants perceived greater exertion during GXT and impaired recovery following GXT in EF compared to O and ML. These results may be attributed to either a drop in female sex hormone concentrations or discomfort associated with menses. The male participants did not exhibit any changes over time. Future studies using subjective parameters such as perceived exertion to track the internal load of training in the naturally menstruating female population should consider menses.",['Delp M; Chesbro GA; Pribble BA; Miller RM; Pereira HM; Black CD; Larson RD'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38274043,the underrepresentation of the female population could be attributed to difficulty in appropriately accounting for the effects of the menstrual cycle (MC) previous studies examining the effects of the MC on aerobic performance and subjective measures of aerobic performance show conflicting results.
The latest reports and treatment methods on polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly recognized endocrine disorder. The pathogenesis is not fully known. Polycystic ovary syndrome is still difficult to diagnose correctly, despite simple diagnostic criteria. The aim of the study is to review the current knowledge about PCOS and treatment options for patients with the disease. To explore this topic, publications were reviewed and conclusions drawn from them. The incidence of hyperandrogenism in a patient with PCOS may be as high as 60-80%. Increased androgen levels affect ovulation and menstruation, and also result in hirsutism and acne. Additionally, patients have problems with proper glucose tolerance (insulin resistance), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. PCOS results in various symptoms in patients. The latest treatment methods were analysed. A standard review of publications in the field of diagnosis and treatment of PCOS, IR and hyperandrogenism was used. Lifestyle, especially diet, deserves special attention due to its ease of use. Sleep quality, physical activity and stress reduction are also important. Diet should be the treatment of first choice. Only if dietary intervention does not bring results, the doctor considers pharmacotherapy. Recently, acupuncture and herbal medicine, vagus nerve stimulation have been used in the treatment of PCOS and regulation of hormone levels. Patients are given supplementation to improve the quality of functioning, but it must be remembered that inappropriate doses or too long use may result in a toxic effect opposite to the therapeutic one. Appropriate diet, physical activity - lifestyle changes are crucial in the treatment of PCOS. Supplementation and pharmaceuticals support treatment. It is mandatory to examine these environmental and lifestyle factors as they not only contribute to the occurrence of the disease but also influence its progression.",['Stańczak NA; Grywalska E; Dudzińska E'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38965663,the latest reports and treatment methods on polycystic ovary syndrome were analysed. the study is to review the current knowledge about PCOS and treatment options for patients with the disease.
Segmentation and Multi-Timepoint Tracking of 3D Cancer Organoids from Optical Coherence Tomography Images Using Deep Neural Networks.,"Recent years have ushered in a transformative era in in vitro modeling with the advent of organoids, three-dimensional structures derived from stem cells or patient tumor cells. Still, fully harnessing the potential of organoids requires advanced imaging technologies and analytical tools to quantitatively monitor organoid growth. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising imaging modality for organoid analysis due to its high-resolution, label-free, non-destructive, and real-time 3D imaging capabilities, but accurately identifying and quantifying organoids in OCT images remain challenging due to various factors. Here, we propose an automatic deep learning-based pipeline with convolutional neural networks that synergistically includes optimized preprocessing steps, the implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model, and ad-hoc postprocessing methods, showcasing good generalizability and tracking capabilities over an extended period of 13 days. The proposed tracking algorithm thoroughly documents organoid evolution, utilizing reference volumes, a dual branch analysis, key attribute evaluation, and probability scoring for match identification. The proposed comprehensive approach enables the accurate tracking of organoid growth and morphological changes over time, advancing organoid analysis and serving as a solid foundation for future studies for drug screening and tumor drug sensitivity detection based on organoids.","[""Branciforti F; Salvi M; D'Agostino F; Marzola F; Cornacchia S; De Titta MO; Mastronuzzi G; Meloni I; Moschetta M; Porciani N; Sciscenti F; Spertini A; Spilla A; Zagaria I; Deloria AJ; Deng S; Haindl R; Szakacs G; Csiszar A; Liu M; Drexler W; Molinari F; Meiburger KM""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38928633,"Optical coherence tomography is a promising imaging modality for organoid analysis due to its high-resolution, label-free, non-destructive, and real-time 3D imaging capabilities. ad-hoc postprocessing methods showcase good generalizability and tracking capabilities over an extended period of 13 days."
Danazol's use for menstrual suppression in transgender individuals: A retrospective multi-site cohort study.,"Danazol is a synthetic progestin with androgenic effects that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of endometriosis, benign fibrocystic breast disease, and hereditary angioedema. In recent years, increasing numbers of transgender and nonbinary individuals seeking menstrual suppression have been offered danazol due to its potential to both induce amenorrhea and cause reversible androgenic side effects including pigmentation of vellus hairs and voice changes, which may be desirable in this population. There are currently no studies assessing use of danazol within the transgender population for menstrual suppression. This study's primary aim was to evaluate the use of danazol as a menstrual suppression agent in transgender patients. This was a retrospective multisite cohort study of all individuals who had been on danazol at two tertiary care centers between 2000 and 2022. All patients prescribed danazol were identified using a search of the electronic medical records. For demographic purposes, comparisons were made between those who did and did not use danazol for the purpose of menstrual suppression. A detailed chart review was then performed to analyze the experiences of menstrual suppression in transgender and nonbinary patients. Most transgender and nonbinary patients on danazol for menstrual suppression remained on it at their most recent follow-up visit, and many charts noted improvements in gender dysphoria, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Most transgender patients achieved amenorrhea. Danazol may be a reasonable option for menstrual suppression in transgender and nonbinary patients. Our findings show its potential to not only induce amenorrhea but cause desired androgenic symptoms and improve gender dysphoria, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and heavy bleeding. While the androgenic effects of danazol are less desirable in cisgender populations, it is an attractive option for menstrual suppression in transgender and nonbinary patients.",['Scatoni A; Roberts Z; Boskey ER; Staffa S; Roden RC; Redwood E; Grimstad F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39051650,danazol is a synthetic progestin with androgenic effects approved by the fda. it is a retrospective multi-site cohort study of transgender and nonbinary patients. there are currently no studies assessing use of danazol within the transgender population for menstrual suppression.
A Decade of Single-Center Experience in Children With Congenital Pyriform Sinus Fistula (CPSF).,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser cauterization in the treatment of pediatric congenital pyriform sinus fistula (CPSF), and to track and follow up the long-term outcome of the postoperative patients. This retrospective study was conducted at a single center, where clinical data and follow-up information of children with CPSF who underwent CO<sub>2</sub> laser cauterization with the assistance of a suspension laryngoscope and microscope were collected and analyzed their clinical characteristics and prognosis. Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of the number of laser cauterization procedures. A total of 238 children diagnosed with CPSF were recruited for this study, with 235 patients successfully achieving closure of the internal fistula through one or more CO<sub>2</sub> laser cauterization procedures without recurrence. The median duration of follow-up was 6.46 (5.20, 7.64) years. Merely three patients (1.3%) developed recurrent cervical infection and eventually underwent open neck surgery. There were no instances of permanent perioperative complications throughout the follow-up. Additionally, our analysis revealed that the age at the first operation of CO<sub>2</sub> laser cauterization was an independent risk factor associated with the number of operations. The CO<sub>2</sub> laser cauterization for children with CPSF is an effective and safe treatment with a low recurrence rate and minimal complications during the follow-up period. Consequently, it is advisable to consider CO<sub>2</sub> laser cauterization as a viable therapeutic option for managing pediatric CPSF. 4 Laryngoscope, 2024.",['Ji T; Long T; Liu Y; Tai J; Zhang J; Li Y; Zhang X; Liu Z; Liu Q; Sun N; Wang S; Ni X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082625,a retrospective study was conducted at a single center. the study was conducted at a single center. the study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of carbon dioxide (COsub>2/sub>) laser cauterization in the treatment of pediatric congenital pyriform sinus fistula.

A Qualitative Analysis of Urbanization and Menstrual Health Among Young Women.,"This qualitative study, grounded in theory, employed inductive coding for analysis, focusing on menstrual health among urban women aged 10-25. The research aims to explore the menstrual health status, practices, and beliefs of participants. The research delves into the impact of recent government initiatives on menstrual health and assesses the role of urbanization in shaping evolving menstrual health practices among young girls. Employing in-depth qualitative methods such as interviews and focus group discussions, the study seeks a comprehensive understanding of participants' experiences and perceptions related to menstrual health. The dynamics of women's menstrual experiences are significantly influenced by urbanization, heightened exposure to social media, evolving lifestyles, and government initiatives like the distribution of menstrual products in schools and the enhancement of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities in government institutions. Positive shifts have been observed, including reduced restrictions on menstruating individuals, enhanced access to affordable hygiene products, and improved disposal facilitated by municipal garbage collection services. However, notable gaps persist in basic knowledge about menstruation, hygienic practices, effective interpersonal communication with schoolteachers or community health care workers, and compliance with government programs promoting weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and biannual Albendazole intake, calling for substantial improvement.",['Dalai S; Malini DS; Satapathy DM; Patro S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38633924,"qualitative study aims to explore menstrual health status, practices, and beliefs of participants. study aims to explore the impact of recent government initiatives on menstrual health."
Prenatal risk assessment of Xp21.1 duplication involving the <i>DMD</i> gene by optical genome mapping.,"Structural variants (SVs) of unknown significance are great challenges for prenatal risk assessment, especially when involving dose-sensitive genes such as <i>DMD</i> The pathogenicities of 5'-terminal <i>DMD</i> duplications in the database remain controversial. Four prenatal cases with Xp21.1 duplications were identified by routine prenatal genomic testing, encompassing the 5'-UTR to exons 1-2 in family 1 and family 2, and to exons 1-9 in family 3. The duplication in family 4 was non-contiguous covering the 5'-UTR to exon 1 and exons 3-7. All were traced to unaffected males in the family pedigrees. A new genome-wide approach of optical genome mapping was performed in families 1, 2, and 3 to delineate the breakpoints and orientation of the duplicated fragments. The extra copies were tandemly inserted into the upstream of <i>DMD</i>, preserving the integrity of ORF from the second copy. The pathogenicities were thus reclassified as likely benign. Our data highlight the importance of structural delineation by optical genome mapping in prenatal risk assessment of incidentally identified SVs involving <i>DMD</i> and other similar large dose-sensitive genes.",['Zhang Y; Du Q; Gao H; Pan Y; Liu N; Qiu C; Liu X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39117454,Xp21.1 duplication involving i>DMD/i> gene. pathogenicities of 5'-terminal i>DMD/i> duplications remain controversial. four prenatal cases with Xp21.1 duplications were identified by routine prenatal genomic testing.
Myths and Methodologies: Standardisation in human physiology research-should we control the controllables?,"The premise of research in human physiology is to explore a multifaceted system whilst identifying one or a few outcomes of interest. Therefore, the control of potentially confounding variables requires careful thought regarding the extent of control and complexity of standardisation. One common factor to control prior to testing is diet, as food and fluid provision may deviate from participants' habitual diets, yet a self-report and replication method can be flawed by under-reporting. Researchers may also need to consider standardisation of physical activity, whether it be through familiarisation trials, wash-out periods, or guidance on levels of physical activity to be achieved before trials. In terms of pharmacological agents, the ethical implications of standardisation require researchers to carefully consider how medications, caffeine consumption and oral contraceptive prescriptions may affect the study. For research in females, it should be considered whether standardisation between- or within-participants in regards to menstrual cycle phase is most relevant. The timing of measurements relative to various other daily events is relevant to all physiological research and so it can be important to standardise when measurements are made. This review summarises the areas of standardisation which we hope will be considered useful to anyone involved in human physiology research, including when and how one can apply standardisation to various contexts.",['Merrell LH; Perkin OJ; Bradshaw L; Collier-Bain HD; Collins AJ; Davies S; Eddy R; Hickman JA; Nicholas AP; Rees D; Spellanzon B; James LJ; McKay AKA; Smith HA; Turner JE; Koumanov F; Maher J; Thompson D; Gonzalez JT; Betts JA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763158,the premise of research in human physiology is to explore a multifaceted system. the control of potentially confounding variables requires careful thought. a self-report and replication method can be flawed by under-reporting.
A randomized controlled trial of social media promotion in neurosurgical publishing.,"The importance of social media has seen a dramatic increase in recent times, but much about its influence in academia is still unknown. To date, no comparative studies analysing the effect of social media promotion on citation counts have been undertaken in neurosurgical publishing. We randomized 177 articles published in Acta Neurochirurgica from May to September 2020. The 89 articles in the intervention group received a standardized social media promotion through one post on our official Twitter/X account, whereas the 88 articles in the control group did not receive any social media promotion. Citation counts, website visits and PDF downloads were tracked at one and two years post-promotion. We found no significant difference in number of citations at one year post-promotion (Intervention: 1.85 ± 3.94 vs. Control: 2.67 ± 6.65, p = 0.322) or at two years (5.35 ± 7.39 vs. 7.09 ± 12.1, p = 0.249). Similarly, no difference was detected in website visits at one (587.46 ± 568.04 vs. 590.65 ± 636.25, p = 0.972) or two years (865.79 ± 855.80 vs. 896.31 ± 981.97, p = 0.826) and PDF downloads at one (183.40 ± 152.02 vs. 187.78 ± 199.01, p = 0.870) or two years (255.99 ± 218.97 vs. 260.97 ± 258.44, p = 0.890). In a randomized study, a structured promotion of general neurosurgical articles on Twitter/X did not significantly impact citation count, website visits, or PDF downloads compared to no social media promotion. Combined with published evidence to date, the impact of social media on citation counts in academic publishing ultimately remains unclear.",['Vieli M; Battilana B; Alamri A; Rabiei K; Lippa L; Karekezi C; Kolias A; Serra C; Regli L; Mathiesen T; Staartjes VE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39060778,177 articles were published in Acta Neurochirurgica from may to September 2020. no comparative studies have been undertaken in neurosurgical publishing.
Evaluation of menstrual irregularities following COVID-19 infection or vaccination: The impact of COVID anxiety and associated risk factors.,"There has been significant interest in the changes in menstrual cycles following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or vaccination. This study aimed to investigate the evidence for such changes and their potential risk factors. We used a descriptive study design and gathered data by sharing an online survey questionnaire on social media platforms. The questionnaire included questions regarding sociodemographic factors, menstrual cycle changes, and COVID-19 anxiety. The study population comprised women aged 18 to 49 years from Izmir. All data analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21.0. The risk factors influencing menstrual irregularities were determined after the COVID binary logistic regression analysis, including univariate and multivariate models. Among the 465 participants, those with an associate's degree had a significantly higher risk of menstrual irregularities than those with a high school diploma (P = .012). Anxiety scores emerged as a significant risk factor for menstrual cycle irregularities (P = .026). However, neither COVID-19 infection nor vaccination resulted in significant changes in the menstrual cycle characteristics (P > .05). Other sociodemographic variables, such as age, body mass index, and smoking, were not significantly associated with menstrual cycle changes(P > .05). The study findings suggest that educational level and anxiety may play a role in menstrual irregularities, whereas COVID-19 infection or vaccination itself may not directly affect menstrual cycle.",['Küçükerdem HS; Özdemir TD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941384,"study gathered data by sharing an online survey questionnaire on social media. the questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic factors, menstrual cycle changes, and COVID-19 anxiety."
"The effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the menstrual cycle in female in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Recently, few studies have mentioned minor changes in women's menstrual cycle after the COVID-19 vaccination. There were many reported cases of female menstrual cycle problems in primary healthcare clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study aimed to explore the prevalence of menstrual irregularities after the COVID-19 vaccine among females of childbearing age in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This observational cross-sectional study was conducted from dec 2021 to June 2022 in Saudi Arabia. The study was carried out by using a convenience sampling technique. Our analysis includes 1066 participants. Abnormal menstruation was significantly associated with hypertension (p-value = 0.024), polycystic ovary syndrome (p-value = 0.001), and at least one gynaecological condition (p-value < 0.001). However, the multivariate regression analysis showed that menstrual abnormality before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 0.09, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.14, p-value < 0.001) was more likely to be associated with abnormal menstruation after receiving the vaccine. Our study findings showed a significant association between covid-19 vaccination and menstruation irregularity before administering the covid-19 vaccine, irrespective of vaccine type or the number of doses administered. Future and ongoing clinical trials should investigate menstrual abnormalities, other abnormal vaginal bleeding and hormonal changes post-vaccination, especially the COVID-19 vaccine.",['Saleh Alzahrani H; Ali Algashami S; Abdulaziz Alharkan A; Sultan Alotaibi N; Waseem Algahs N'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37128295,study aimed to explore the prevalence of menstrual irregularities after the vaccine. abnormal menstruation was significantly associated with hypertension.
In vitro fertilization outcome based on the detailed early luteal phase trajectory of hormones: a prospective cohort study.,"Ovarian stimulation and the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for triggering oocyte maturation in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) introduces several differences in luteal phase hormone levels compared with natural cycles that may negatively impact on endometrial receptivity and pregnancy rates after fresh embryo transfer. Exogenous luteal phase support is given to overcome these issues. The suitability of a pragmatic approach to luteal phase support is not known due to a lack of data on early phase luteal hormone levels and their association with fertility outcomes during IVF with fresh embryo transfer. This study determined early luteal phase profiles of serum progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and hCG, and associations between hormone levels/hormone level profile after hCG trigger and the live birth rate in women undergoing IVF with fresh embryo transfer. This prospective single center, cohort study was conducted in Vietnam from January 2021 to December 2022. Women aged 18-38 years with normal ovarian reserve and undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol were included. Serum hormone levels were determined before trigger, at 12, 24 and 36 h after hCG, and daily from 1 to 6 days after oocyte pick-up. Serum hormone level profiles were classified as lower or upper. The primary outcome was live birth rate based on early luteal phase hormone level profile. Ninety-five women were enrolled. Live birth occurred in 19/69 women (27.5%) with a lower progesterone profile and 13/22 (59.1%) with an upper progesterone profile (risk ratio [RR] 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-3.60), and in 6/31 (19.4%) versus 26/60 (43.3%) with a lower versus upper serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone profile (RR 2.24; 95% CI 1.03-4.86). Nearly 20% of women had peak progesterone concentration on or before day 3 after oocyte pick-up, and this was associated with significantly lower chances of having a life birth. These data show the importance of proper corpus luteum function with sufficient progesterone/17-hydroxyprogesterone production for achievement of pregnancy and to maximize the chance of live birth during IVF.

Performance analysis and mechanical determinants of the opening lap of the team sprint in elite-level track cycling.,"The team sprint (TS) is a three-lap pursuit and the most revered event in track sprint cycling. The opening lap of the TS is an important determinant to the overall performance. But despite it being the most controlled and repeatable task in track sprint cycling, very little data are available to better understand the performance of the opening lap. The aim of this study was split into three-parts: part one, to better understand the profile and the indices thought to be determinants of the opening lap of the TS in elite sprint track cyclists. Part two of the study examined all available timing splits (15, 65, 125 and 250 m) from 36 standing-start laps. Part three of the study examined the peak torque outputs and peak power outputs of different various starts performed over a 3-month period. The results showed time to 125 m exhibited a near perfect relationship with starter lap performance. Very strong relationships were seen with 15 and 65 m split times and final lap performance. Peak torque of the lead starting leg and peak power output were shown to be highly predictive 15 m, 65 and 125 m performance in training. These data suggested the first 15 m is highly important and predicts a disproportionately high level of final opening lap time performance. Therefore, it is likely that peak power output normalised to system mass and peak torque of lead leg is a strong determinant of overall performance in the TS.",['Kordi M; van Rijswijk I'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38943450,the team sprint (TS) is a three-lap pursuit and the most revered event in track sprint cycling. but very little data are available to better understand the performance of the opening lap.
The impact of the menstrual cycle on orthopaedic sports injuries in female athletes.,"There is a disparity in sport-related injuries between sexes, with females sustaining non-contact musculoskeletal injuries at a higher rate. Anterior cruciate ligament ruptures are between two and eight times more common than in males, and females also have a higher incidence of ankle sprains, patellofemoral pain, and bone stress injuries. The sequelae of such injuries can be devastating to an athlete, resulting in time out of sport, surgery, and the early onset of osteoarthritis. It is important to identify the causes of this disparity and introduce prevention programmes to reduce the incidence of these injuries. A natural difference reflects the effect of reproductive hormones in females, which have receptors in certain musculoskeletal tissues. Relaxin increases ligamentous laxity. Oestrogen decreases the synthesis of collagen and progesterone does the opposite. Insufficient diet and intensive training can lead to menstrual irregularities, which are common in female athletes and result in injury, whereas oral contraception may have a protective effect against certain injuries. It is important for coaches, physiotherapists, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes to be aware of these issues and to implement preventive measures. This annotation explores the relationship between the menstrual cycle and orthopaedic sports injuries in pre-menopausal females, and proposes recommendations to mitigate the risk of sustaining these injuries.",['Raj RD; Fontalis A; Grandhi TSP; Kim WJ; Gabr A; Haddad FS'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37391203,"women have a higher incidence of musculoskeletal injuries than men. women have a higher incidence of ankle sprains, patellofemoral pain, and bone stress injuries."
Economic Burden of Endometrial Cancer Associated With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive-aged females, and women with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial cancer (EndoCA), the most common gynecological malignancy. Our study sought to assess the economic burden associated with EndoCA in PCOS. Using PRISMA systematic review guidelines, we evaluated studies on EndoCA rates in patients with PCOS. Excluded studies were reviews and case reports, non-human subjects, without controls, without full text available, or reporting solely on other conditions. Selected studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis used DerSimonian-Laird random effects model to assess pooled risk ratio (RR). Excess cost was assessed in U.S. dollars (USD). Of 98 studies screened, nine were included. Pooled RR for EndoCA in PCOS was 3.46 (95% CI 2.28-5.23), p=<0.001. In the US, prevalence of EndoCA in patients with PCOS in 2020 was 1.712%, compared with a baseline estimated prevalence in all women of 0.489%. The excess prevalence of EndoCA attributable to PCOS was 1.223%, approximately 98,348 affected women. A population-attributable fraction of EndoCA for PCOS was 24.4%. Given estimated cost of EndoCA exceeds $1.9 billion (in 2023 USD), the economic burden of EndoCA attributable to PCOS exceeds $467 million/year. The excess annual healthcare cost for EndoCA attributable to PCOS exceeds $467 million/year (2023 USD) for the US. Although a concerning morbidity of PCOS, it is notable that the economic burden of EndoCA attributable to the disorder represents only a small fraction of its total healthcare burden.",['Pace L; Markovic D; Buyalos R; Bril F; Azziz R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39106216,polycystic ovary syndrome is most common endocrine disorder among reproductive-aged females. women with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial cancer.
Menstrual cycle phases and dosage of synthetic hormonal contraceptives influence diurnal rhythm characteristics of distal skin temperature.,"This study aimed to explore how natural menstrual cycle phases and dosage of oral hormonal contraceptives (OC) influence the diurnal rhythm of distal skin temperature (DST) under real-life conditions. Participants were 41 healthy females (23.9 ± 2.48 y), comprising 27 females taking monophasic hormonal oral contraceptives (OC users) and 14 females with menstrual cycles (non-OC users). Wrist DST was continuously recorded and averaged over two consecutive 24-hour days during (pseudo)follicular and (pseudo)luteal menstrual phases. Diurnal rhythm characteristics, i.e. acrophase and amplitude, describing timing and strength of the DST rhythm, respectively, were calculated using cosinor analysis. Results show that non-OC users experienced earlier diurnal DST maximum (acrophase, <i>p</i> = 0.019) and larger amplitude (<i>p</i> = 0.016) during the luteal phase than during the follicular phase. This was observed in most (71.4%) but not all individuals. The OC users showed no differences in acrophase or amplitude between pseudoluteal and pseudofollicular phases. OC users taking a higher dosage of progestin displayed a larger amplitude for DST rhythm during the pseudoluteal phase (<i>p</i> = 0.009), while estrogen dosage had no effect. In conclusion, monophasic OC cause changes in diurnal DST rhythm, similar to those observed in the luteal phase of females with menstrual cycles, suggesting that synthetic progestins act in a similar manner on skin thermoregulation as progesterone does.",['Dittmar M; Möllgaard L; Engelhard F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38634452,menstrual cycle phases and dosage of synthetic hormonal contraceptives influence diurnal rhythm characteristics of distal skin temperature. participants were 41 healthy females (23.9  2.48 y) and 27 females taking monophasic hormonal oral contraceptives (OC users) and 14 females with menstrual cycles (non-OC users)
The monthly trends of malaria cases in children under 5 years of age in Guinea: comparative analysis between a seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and a non-SMC health district.,"The Republic of Guinea, where malaria represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children, the seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is deployed only in areas with very seasonal modes of transmission. It should target children at the highest risk of serious illness. The objective of the study was to prevent uncomplicated and serious cases of malaria in the target population. This study aimed to analyse the monthly trends in malaria-related morbidity among children under the age of 5 in Guinea. This was a quasi-experimental study with routine data from the National Health Information System (SNIS). The two districts Mamou (the SMC intervention site) and Kindia (the control site) were selected to compare the monthly trends in malaria cases among children under the age of 5, from July to October, covering the years from 2015 to 2020. The statistical analysis used interrupted time series to estimate the effects of the SMC. The SMC programme contributed to a significant average reduction in the number of malaria cases of 225 cases per month in the intervention district (95% CI - 362 to - 88; p = 0.002), compared to the control district. However, the study also revealed that the effect of SMC varied between cycles, presenting different monthly malaria cases. The SMC contributed to a significant reduction in malaria cases among children under the age of 5 in the health district of Mamou from 2018 to 2020. However, this reduction varied by monthly SMC cycle. This study suggests extending the SMC in other areas with high perennial seasonal transmission respecting the World Health Organization SMC eligibility criteria, as a strategy in the dynamic of reducing malaria cases in children under the age of 5 in Guinea.",['Keita KS; Camara BS; Camara S; Barry F; Sidibe T; Kourouma K; Diallo R; Toure M; Camara A; Balde MD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39118160,seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is deployed only in areas with very seasonal modes of transmission. it should target children at the highest risk of serious illness. the aim of the study was to prevent uncomplicated and serious cases of malaria in the target population.
Productivity loss due to menstruation-related symptoms: a nationwide cross-sectional survey among 32 748 women.,"To evaluate age-dependent productivity loss caused by menstruation-related symptoms, measured in absenteeism (time away from work or school) and presenteeism (productivity loss while present at work or school). Design/setting: internet-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in the Netherlands from July to October 2017. 32 748 women aged 15-45 years, recruited through social media. self-reported lost productivity in days, divided into absenteeism and presenteeism; impact of menstrual symptoms; reasons women give when calling in sick; and women's preferences regarding the implications of menstruation-related symptoms for schools and workplaces. A total of 13.8% (n=4514) of all women reported absenteeism during their menstrual periods with 3.4% (n=1108) reporting absenteeism every or almost every menstrual cycle. The mean absenteeism related to a woman's period was 1.3 days per year. A total of 80.7% (n=26 438) of the respondents reported presenteeism and decreased productivity a mean of 23.2 days per year. An average productivity loss of 33% resulted in a mean of 8.9 days of total lost productivity per year due to presenteeism. Women under 21 years were more likely to report absenteeism due to menstruation-related symptoms (OR 3.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 3.6). When women called in sick due to their periods, only 20.1% (n=908) told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. Notably, 67.7% (n=22 154) of the participants wished they had greater flexibility in their tasks and working hours at work or school during their periods.

Pathophysiology and management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: a review.,"According to World Health Organization (WHO), iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is considered the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting approximately 30% of the global population. While gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women are the primary causes of IDA, insufficient dietary iron intake and reduced iron absorption contribute to the condition. The aim of IDA treatment is to restore iron stores and normalise haemoglobin levels in affected patients. Iron plays a critical role in various cellular mechanisms, including oxygen delivery, electron transport, and enzymatic activity. During pregnancy, the mother's blood volume increases, and the growing foetus requires a significant increase in iron. Iron deficiency during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes such as maternal illness, low birth weight, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Iron supplementation is commonly used to treat IDA; however, not all patients benefit from this therapy due to factors such as low compliance and ineffectiveness. In the past, IV iron therapy was underutilised due to its unfavourable and occasionally unsafe side effects. Nevertheless, the development of new type II and III iron complexes has improved compliance, tolerability, efficacy, and safety profiles. This article aims to provide an updated overview of the diagnosis and management of IDA during pregnancy. It will discuss the advantages and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron and the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and overall management of IDA in pregnancy.",['Kirthan JPA; Somannavar MS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37787837,iron deficiency anaemia is considered the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women are the primary causes of IDA. but insufficient dietary iron intake and reduced iron absorption contribute to the condition.
Breast Cancer in the Transgender Population.,"ES is a 41-year-old transgender male who presented to medical oncology as a referral from surgical oncology for T2N0M0 right breast cancer. At that time, he was receiving weekly testosterone injections intramuscularly at 0.25 mg, and had been on this regimen for 7 months. He was planning bilateral mastectomies in the spring. That winter, he palpated a mass in his right breast, and imaging revealed a 2.5-cm hypoechoic mass. A biopsy of the mass revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, with a nuclear grade of 3. His tumor was estrogen receptor positive (H-score of 180), progesterone receptor positive (H-score of 90), androgen receptor positive (H-score of 220), and HER-2/<i>neu</i> positive by FISH, with a Ki-67 of 90%. The clinical experience of ES illustrates challenges common to the sexual and gender minority population. ES presented to the clinic with a female friend. At that time, his name and gender in the electronic medical record (EMR) matched his driver's license, and not his preferred name or gender. Consequently, when he was called from the waiting room, he was called by his former name. The staff had not been notified of the appropriate name or pronoun to use prior to ES's arrival, and consequently was associating ES with a female gender, as indicated in the EMR. When the question about menstrual status was addressed, he stated that he had not had a period in 7 months since beginning testosterone treatment. The medical assistant questioned the use of testosterone, and ES had to explain his gender reassignment journey. By the time the physician assistant (PA) entered the room to perform the first part of the shared visit, ES was visibly upset, expressing anger with nonverbal cues. During the conversation, the PA did not acknowledge or establish the relationship of ES's female friend. The PA did not address the issue of gender identity, the use of testosterone, or plans for reassignment surgery. The physician also deferred discussion of gender reassignment during his portion of the visit and, without asking about gender reassignment, recommended cessation of testosterone therapy. Neoadjuvant docetaxel/cyclophosphamide/trastuzumab/pertuzumab was ordered, and ES agreed to treatment, but declined following the suggestion to stop testosterone. At each treatment visit, ES had to check in at the desk with his former name, resulting in confusion from the staff. With each lab draw, his name and birthdate were confirmed using the former name. With every administration of chemotherapy, double-nurse verification at the chairside was performed by reading his arm band and comparing it to the drug label. For each visit, ES had to use his old name six times. With new staff assigned to him each week, he felt pressured to explain his gender identity to several new people at each visit. At one particular visit, a patient's family in the next cubicle overheard this conversation, and ES overheard them discussing and laughing about his gender identity. ES dreaded his chemotherapy appointments not just due to the expected toxicity, but also because of the insensitivity toward his chosen gender. ES tolerated chemotherapy and proceeded to surgery. He underwent bilateral mastectomies by the surgical oncologist, who had discussed his gender reassignment with him and had referred him to plastic surgery for co-management of the surgical intervention. The plastic surgery team planned for reconstruction to include skin and soft-tissue rearrangement to give an incision line along the lower border of the pectoralis for better male cosmetic outcomes. Together, they performed bilateral mastectomies with right sentinel lymph node biopsy, horizontal mastopexy, and nipple-areolar grafting. Ultimately, the pathology revealed a complete response, and ES was pleased with the cosmetic outcome. ES was then started on tamoxifen. Again it was suggested that he discontinue testosterone therapy. He determined that he was more comfortable with an increased risk of recurrence than he was with feminine physical characteristics and chose to continue testosterone. After 6 weeks of tamoxifen, his menses resumed. He elected to discontinue tamoxifen. He had no more vaginal bleeding after that episode. He was referred for bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (BSO), with the intent to treat with an aromatase inhibitor. He proceeded with BSO and opted against the aromatase inhibitor, citing concerns about unknown interactions with gender-affirming medication. He completed 1 year of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and continued surveillance visits.",['Fehl A; Ferrari S; Wecht Z; Rosenzweig M'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33343986,ES is a transgender male who presented to medical oncology as a referral from surgical oncology for right breast cancer. he was receiving weekly testosterone injections intramuscularly at 0.25 mg. he was planning bilateral mastectomies in the spring.
"""You're Not Alone"": How Adolescents Share Dysmenorrhea Experiences Through Vlogs.","Many adolescents experience severe pain during menstruation, yet their attempts to receive medical attention to alleviate or manage this pain are often met with dismissal or disbelief. In light of these barriers to care, many adolescents turn to social media to share their experiences with menstruation and pain, as well as hear from other members of their community. In this study, we investigated how adolescents present their experiences with menstruation in vlogs (or ""video blogs""). Using critical qualitative methods and a four-column analysis structure, we transcribed and thematically analyzed the audio and video content of 17 YouTube vlogs wherein adolescents described their experiences with menstrual pain. We found that stylistically, the vloggers modulated between a polished documentary style and an intimate storytime style of video production. We additionally found that vloggers spoke about their menstrual pain experiences from three perspectives: as a <i>Patient</i> managing and diagnosing physical symptoms, as a <i>Self</i> considering how the pain affects their life and ambitions, and as a <i>Teacher</i> educating their audience. Considering both the visual and audio data, we discuss how healthcare providers can use these findings to inform their approach to discussing menstrual pain with adolescents. We further discuss possible future directions for research into health story sharing on social media.",['Mohammed SS; Gagnon MM; Cummings JA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38127003,vlogs are a series of videos that show menstrual pain. the videos are a series of videos that help adolescents share their experiences. the videos are a way to share their experiences with menstruation.
Circulating profile of Activin-Follistatin-Inhibin Axis in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea in response to leptin treatment.,"Chronic energy deficiency observed in women that exercise strenuously affects reproductive function, often leading to hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA). In such conditions, hypoleptinemia and robust changes in the Activin-Follistatin-Inhibin Axis (AFI) are observed. Treatment with leptin restores menstruation in many (60% responders) but not all (40% non-responders) women, suggesting that leptin is not the only regulator of reproductive function related to energy balance. In this work, we aimed to identify differences in hormonal profiles between leptin responders and non-responders among women with HA, with particular focus on the AFI axis. AFI axis and reproductive hormones (LH, FSH, Estradiol, ΑΜΗ) were measured in blood in: a) An open-label interventional study, b) a randomized placebo-controlled trial, both investigating responders versus non-responders/women with HA treated with leptin. Women with HA that responded to leptin treatment have higher circulating levels/peak values of Inhibin A, Estradiol (E2), higher LH/FSH ratio and a trend to lower AMH compared with non-responders. Components of the AFI axis are associated with improvement of reproductive function in women with HA treated with leptin. ΑΜΗ may serve as a marker of ovarian recovery under HA treatment.",['Bouzoni E; Perakakis N; Mantzoros CS'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33045195,Activin-Follistatin-Inhibin Axis is a hormonal regulator of reproductive function. leptin is not the only regulator of energy balance related to energy balance.
"The impact of rotating work schedules, chronotype, and restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease on sleep quality among female hospital nurses and midwives: A cross-sectional survey.","Decreases in subjective sleep quality are prevalent among nurses and midwives engaged in rotating shift work. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between differences in work schedules and subjective sleep quality among female nursing staff. A cross-sectional survey design was used for descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Data collection was conducted from December 2016 to September 2017. Participants were recruited from five regional core hospitals in Japan. A total of 1253 nurses and midwives were included in the final analysis. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Chronotype and social jet lag were calculated for both work day and work-free day. Symptoms related to restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease were assessed using the Japanese version of the Cambridge-Hopkins questionnaire short form 13. Participants with the urge to move their legs, though not fulfilling the restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease criteria, were classified as having leg motor restlessness. Logistic regression analyses for poor sleep were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, drinking, menstruation status, the presence of premenstrual syndrome, and the presence of a spouse. Rates of poor sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score ≥6) among those working, day shifts, rotating 12.5 hour night shifts, rotating 16 hour night shifts, and three-shift rotations were 41.2%, 51.1%, 44.5%, and 60.4%, respectively. Approximately 40% of three-shift rotation workers experienced difficulty initiating sleep. Shift workers tended to exhibit evening chronotype, delayed sleep phase, and high social jet lag. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease was 2.5%. Leg motor restlessness was observed in. 15.5% of participants. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of three-shift work (vs. day shift), evening chronotype (vs. morning chronotype), and the presence of leg motor restlessness (vs. no leg motor restlessness) for those with poor sleep were 2.20 (1.47-3.30), 1.95 (1.29-2.94), and 1.66 (1.15-2.39), respectively. Regardless of the working schedules, rates of poor sleep were high among female hospital nurses and midwives. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is influenced by three-shift rotation, the evening chronotype, and leg motor restlessness.",['Uekata S; Kato C; Nagaura Y; Eto H; Kondo H'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31129552,a cross-sectional survey was used to examine the relationship between differences in work schedules and subjective sleep quality among female nursing staff. a total of 1253 nurses and midwives were recruited from five regional core hospitals in Japan.
The impact of the war in Ukraine on the reproductive health of female military personnel.,"To explore the link between mental health, physical well-being, and reproductive system pathology in females who suffered war-related concussions. A study was conducted at the Kyiv Center of Reproductive and Perinatal Medicine with 715 participants. The group included 457 female military personnel with concussions (211 with post-concussive syndrome (PCS), 246 without), 208 women from occupied/deoccupied areas (103 with PCS, 105 without), and 50 civilians from safe zones. Average deployment time (mean ± standard deviation) was 60.26 ± 42.21 months, and trauma occurred 18.81 ± 9.221 months ago. Medical history and physical examinations were performed. Female soldiers with PCS had a 1.3 times higher likelihood (P < 0.015) of experiencing longer menstrual periods. Painful menstruation was 1.47 times more frequent (P < 0.001), and heavy periods were 1.64 times more common (P < 0.003). Infertility duration in concussed women was 5.36 ± 0.13 years, whereas those with PCS experienced 1.29 times longer duration (6.02 ± 0.21 years) (P < 0.001) compared with women without PCS (4.69 ± 0.13 years). Among concussed soldiers, 69.27% had endometrial structural pathology, with PCS occurring 1.64 times more often (P < 0.001). The health decline in female veterans and active-duty personnel extends beyond medical implications and has social significance.

Interconnected microbiomes-insights and innovations in female urogenital health.,"The paradigm that the vaginal microbiota is a protective gateway for the urinary and reproductive systems has endured for more than a century and driven decades of probiotic research. Evidence robustly supports the notion that healthy urogenital microbiomes are predominantly colonized by lactobacilli, particularly Lactobacillus crispatus, which can acidify the local environment and protect against urogynecologic pathogen colonization. However, recent studies are beginning to delve deeper into the intricate mechanistic interactions connecting the microbiome, its diverse functional potential, host immunity, pathogens, and the development of urogenital diseases. Leveraging these emerging insights alongside past successes presents promising opportunities for future therapies aimed at enhancing the management of conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, bladder pain, urinary incontinence, and beyond.",['Al KF; Parris J; Engelbrecht K; Reid G; Burton JP'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080993,urogenital microbiomes are a protective gateway for the urinary and reproductive systems. the paradigm that the vaginal microbiota is a protective gateway for the urinary and reproductive systems has endured for more than a century.
Acceptability of Gynecologic e-Health Modalities by Hispanic/Latina Women of Reproductive Age.,"Electronic health (e-Health) modalities effectively address healthcare access limitations; however, there are limited data on their adoption by Hispanic/Latina women who are disproportionally affected by health disparities. We conducted a cross-sectional study by disseminating an anonymous electronic questionnaire via social media to assess the perception of Hispanic/Latina women of reproductive age regarding facilitators and barriers for using e-Health modalities, including telemedicine and mobile apps, to monitor gynecologic health. The questionnaire was completed by 351 Hispanic/Latina participants with high levels (98.3%) of advanced technological expertise. Current use of a gynecologic mobile app was reported by 63.8%, primarily for menstruation (85.1%) and ovulation (46.3%) tracking. While only 17.6% of participants were offered the option of a gynecologic consultation via telemedicine, the majority (90.5%) would agree to one. Higher education and advanced technological expertise correlated with acceptance of telemedicine for gynecological consults. Being younger (<29 y/o), a student, not having a preferred gynecologist and having a lower income significantly correlated with gynecologic mobile app acceptability. We showed that e-Health modalities are highly acceptable for Hispanic/Latina women of reproductive age to facilitate gynecological care and documented factors that are significantly associated with e-Health acceptability. These findings are relevant to public health emergencies that cause access to care limitations disproportionally affecting this already underserved population.",['Alvarado A; Ramos-Echevarría P; Cotto-Vázquez AC; Núñez-González S; Nieves-Vázquez CI; Sierra CR; Más-Vayas L; Soto-Soto DM; Llorens A; Bell C; Roy A; Flores I'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38947976,e-Health modalities effectively address healthcare access limitations. there are limited data on their adoption by Hispanic/Latina women.
Sexual dysfunction in women with diabetic kidney.,"Few studies address alteration of sexual function in women with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Quality of life surveys suggest that discussion of sexual function and other reproductive issues are of psychosocial assessment and that education on sexual function in the setting of chronic diseases such as diabetes and CKD is widely needed. Pharmacologic therapy with estrogen/progesterone and androgens along with glycemic control, correction of anemia, ensuring adequate dialysis delivery, and treatment of underlying depression are important. Changes in lifestyle such as smoking cessation, strength training, and aerobic exercises may decrease depression, enhance body image, and have positive impacts on sexuality. Many hormonal abnormalities which occur in women with diabetes and CKD who suffer from chronic anovulation and lack of progesterone secretion may be treated with oral progesterone at the end of each menstrual cycle to restore menstrual cycles. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most common sexual problem reported by women with diabetes and CKD. Sexual function can be assessed in women, using the 9-item Female Sexual Function Index, questionnaire, or 19 items. It is important for nephrologists and physicians to incorporate assessment of sexual function into the routine evaluation protocols.",['Satta E; Magno C; Galì A; Inferrera A; Granese R; Aloisi C; Buemi M; Bellinghieri G; Santoro D'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276130,studies address alteration of sexual function in women with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) nephrologists and physicians should incorporate assessment of sexual function into routine evaluation protocols.
"Implications of Argentine Tango for Health Promotion, Physical Well-Being as Well as Emotional, Personal and Social Life on a Group of Women Who Dance.","The aim of the research was to determine the effect that dance has on the promotion of health, physical well-being, as well as the emotional, personal and social life of women who dance. In addition, the impact of the physical activity of long, often all-night dancing events on women's health was investigated. This included possible disturbances in their monthly cycle and circadian rhythm, taking into account symptoms of biological rhythm disturbances. The study involved 214 women: tango group: 109, sedentary group: 105. The Mann-Whitney U and chi<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare the groups, as well as multiple ordinal regression to analyse individual predictors of missed menstrual periods. The tango vs. sedentary groups did not differ in the duration of menstrual bleeding, the degree of pain during menstruation, the regularity of menstruation, the number of regular monthly cycles per year, and amenorrhea. Intermenstrual spotting was more common in dancers (tango 12.8% vs. sedentary 4.8%; <i>p</i> = 0.038). The frequency of missed periods was not increased by any of the assessed aspects. In 59.6% of female dancers, milongas caused disturbances in circadian rhythms, including extreme fatigue and drowsiness (36.7%), 66.0% of the dancers mentioned only positive aspects of Argentine Tango's impact on their personal life. tango plays a positive and multifaceted role in the lives of dancers and fulfils the need for social contact. The physical effort put into this form of physical activity does not significantly affect the menstrual cycle, and thus the reproductive functions, and can be recommended as an attractive and safe form of physical recreation for women.",['Witkoś J; Hartman-Petrycka M'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34072683,"study involved 214 women: tango group: 109, sedentary group: 105. tango vs. sedentary groups did not differ in the duration of menstrual bleeding, the degree of pain during menstruation, the number of regular monthly cycles per year, and amenorrhea."
Survival-Related Genes on Chromosomes 6 and 17 in Medulloblastoma.,"Survival of Medulloblastoma (MB) depends on various factors, including the gene expression profiles of MB tumor tissues. In this study, we identified 967 MB survival-related genes (SRGs) using a gene expression dataset and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Notably, the SRGs were over-represented on chromosomes 6 and 17, known for the abnormalities monosomy 6 and isochromosome 17 in MB. The most significant SRG was <i>HMGA1</i> (high mobility group AT-hook 1) on chromosome 6, which is a known oncogene and a histone H1 competitor. High expression of <i>HMGA1</i> was associated with worse survival, primarily in the Group 3γ subtype. The high expression of <i>HMGA1</i> was unrelated to any known somatic copy number alteration. Most SRGs on chromosome 17p were associated with low expression in Group 4β, the MB subtype, with 93% deletion of 17p and 98% copy gain of 17q. GO enrichment analysis showed that both chromosomes 6 and 17 included SRGs related to telomere maintenance and provided a rationale for testing telomerase inhibitors in Group 3 MBs. We conclude that <i>HMGA1</i>, along with other SRGs on chromosomes 6 and 17, warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in selected subgroups or subtypes of MB.",['Vriend J; Liu XQ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39062749,chromosomes 6 and 17 included a'survival-related' gene expression dataset. the most significant SRG was i>HMGA1/i> (high mobility group AT-hook 1) on chromosome 6.
Trends in mortality after emergency department presentation for suicidal behaviour in California.,"Emergency department patients presenting with non-fatal suicidal behaviour face elevated risk of suicide and all-cause mortality, but the extent to which this has changed over time is unknown. This study tracked trends in mortality risks faced by emergency department patients presenting with deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation in California. Using statewide linked emergency department and death data, we estimated 2010-2016 trends in suicide and all-cause mortality among emergency department patients with either deliberate self-harm (n=111 658) or suicidal ideation (n=162 959). We also calculated average annual percent changes in age-adjusted mortality rates and compared these to the general California population. Deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation patients' age-adjusted suicide rates decreased by approximately 5% per year during the study period; however, their all-cause mortality trends were flat. In the general California population, suicide rate trends were flat while all-cause mortality slightly declined. Suicide mortality unexpectedly declined among self-harming and suicidal patients presenting to California emergency departments. Additional research is needed to understand the reasons behind this decline and inform quality improvement efforts for suicide prevention in hospital settings.",['Goldman-Mellor S; Olfson M; Schoenbaum M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39009434,emergency department patients presenting with non-fatal suicidal behaviour face elevated risk of suicide and all-cause mortality. this study tracked trends in suicide and all-cause mortality among emergency department patients with either deliberate self-harm (n=111 658) or suicidal ideation (n=162 959)
Magnitude and associated factors of unmet need for family planning among reproductive-aged women in Ethiopia: An umbrella review.,"The World Health Organization defines women with an unmet need for family planning as individuals who are fecund, sexually active, and wanting to either to limit childbirth or postpone their next birth but are not utilizing any form of contraception. Previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have focused on this topic, but no comprehensive summary of the evidence was available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a summary of the findings on the unmet need for family planning among reproductive-aged women in Ethiopia. A search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and RESEARCH 4 LIFE including Hinari, to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies on the prevalence and determinants of the unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool, and the estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. The umbrella review included five studies with a total of 56,169 reproductive-aged women. The pooled prevalence of unmet need for family planning was found to be 27.44% (95% CI: 22.32-32.55), with the heterogeneity index (I square = 99.45%, P = 0.000). Failure to discuss with her partner about family planning methods (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.81, 4.00), being illiterate (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.42, 2.92), age at first marriage (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.44), and educational status of woman's partner (OR: 2.61, 95% CI: 0.83, 4.40) were the factors significantly and positively associated with unmet needs for family planning. The study concludes that the unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia is a significant issue that can be addressed through increasing the educational levels of women and their partners, promoting open discussions about family planning, and preventing early marriages. Collaboration between families, school administrators, and healthcare providers is essential to mitigating this problem.",['Ayele M; Yilak G; Alamrew A; Lake ES; Tilahun BD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39088583,"the world health organization defines women with an unmet need for family planning as individuals who are fecund, sexually active, and wanting to limit childbirth. previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have focused on this topic, but no comprehensive summary of the evidence was available."
Prognostic value of anthropometric- and biochemistry-based nutrition status indices on blood chemistry panel levels during cancer treatment.,"Body weight, body mass index (BMI), Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) are among vital nutrition status indices employed during cancer treatment. These have also been associated with levels of blood chemistry panels (BCPs), which are touted as significant indicators of disease prognosis. However, it remains unclear which nutrition status index better predicts future trends in specific BCPs. Using the records of 407 cancer patients, we retrospectively examined the potential of nutritional status indices at baseline for predicting changes in specific BCPs over a 6-week period. Generally, both serum biochemical parameters and nutrition status indices fluctuated over the study period among study participants. PNI was often linearly associated with blood cell counts (white blood cells [WBCs] and hemoglobin) compared with anthropometric-based nutrition status indices. Increase in body weight was protective against having abnormal lymphocyte levels at 6 weeks (odds ratio [OR]: 0.960-0.974; CI: 0.935-0.997; P < 0.05), while increase in baseline PNI was associated with 0.865-0.941 and 0.675-0.915 odds of having future abnormal WBC and lymphocyte levels, respectively. Increases in PNI were also protective against having future abnormal albumin levels (OR: 0.734-0.886) and 8.5-12.5% decreases in the odds of having an abnormal C-reactive protein level in subsequent visits. Changes in NRS2002 tended to be associated with the odds of having future abnormal blood glucose levels. In conclusion, the serum biochemistry-derived nutrition status index, PNI, is a more consistent measure as an early indicator to track the trends of future changes in the BCPs of cancer patients. This implies that PNI could be targeted as an early-warning measure with relevant preventive interventions for patients at risk of malnutrition.",['Li S; Amakye WK; Zhao Z; Xin X; Jia Y; Zhang H; Ren Y; Zhou Y; Zhai L; Kang W; Lu X; Guo J; Wang M; Xu Y; Yi J; Ren J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39111096,"body weight, body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) are among vital nutrition status indices employed during cancer treatment. these have also been associated with levels of blood chemistry panels (BCPs) which are touted as significant indicators of disease prognosis. however, it remains unclear which nutrition status index better predicts future trends in specific BCPs."
Menstruation and social inequities in Spain: a cross-sectional online survey-based study.,"Available research suggests that menstrual inequity has an impact on (menstrual) health outcomes and emotional wellbeing. It is also a significant barrier to achieve social and gender equity and compromises human rights and social justice. The aim of this study was to describe menstrual inequities and their associations with sociodemographic factors, among women and people who menstruate (PWM) aged 18-55 in Spain. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in Spain between March and July 2021. Descriptive statistical analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were performed. A total of 22,823 women and PWM were included in the analyses (Mean age = 33.2, SD = 8.7). Over half of the participants had accessed healthcare services for menstruation (61.9%). The odds for accessing menstrual-related services were significantly higher among participants with university education (aOR: 1.48, 95% CI, 1.13-1.95). Also, 57.8% reported having had partial or no menstrual education pre-menarche, with odds being higher among participants born in non-European or Latin American countries (aOR: 0.58, 95% CI, 0.36-0.93). Lifetime self-reported menstrual poverty was between 22.2-39.9%. Main risk factors for menstrual poverty were identifying as non-binary (aOR: 1.67, 95% CI, 1.32-2.11), being born in non-European or Latin American countries (aOR: 2.74, 95% CI, 1.77-4.24), and not having a permit to reside in Spain (aOR: 4.27, 95% CI, 1.94-9.38). Completed university education (aOR: 0.61, 95% CI, 0.44-0.84) and no financial hardship < 12 months (aOR: 0.06, 95% CI, 0.06-0.07) were protective factors for menstrual poverty. Besides, 75.2% reported having overused menstrual products due to lack of access to adequate menstrual management facilities.

Period poverty and mental health implications among college-aged women in the United States.,"The purpose of this study is to examine the frequency of ""period poverty,"" or not being able to afford sanitary products, among university students, and associations with poor mental health. An online survey was conducted with a nationally-drawn sample (N = 471) of college-attending women to assess the association between period poverty and depression. Period poverty was measured via two questions designed for this study; depression was measured with the standard PHQ-9. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized for analysis. Among our sample, 14.2% of women had experienced period poverty ever in the past-year; an additional 10% experienced it every month. Compared to those who had never experienced period poverty, adjusted analysis revealed that women with monthly past-year period poverty were the most likely to report moderate/severe depression (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-4.99), followed by those who had experienced it ever in the past year (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI, 0.99-3.38). Many young women cannot afford menstrual health products to meet their monthly needs, and this may impact their mental well-being. Improved access to affordable menstrual products is needed to support these young women.",['Cardoso LF; Scolese AM; Hamidaddin A; Gupta J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407330,"college-aged women in the united states report period poverty and depression. period poverty is a common cause of depression, or not being able to afford sanitary products. depression is measured with the standard PHQ-9."
The combination of dydrogesterone and micronized vaginal progesterone can render serum progesterone level measurements on the day of embryo transfer and rescue attempts unnecessary in an HRT FET cycle.,"To evaluate the role of serum progesterone (P4) on the day of embryo transfer (ET) when dydrogesterone (DYD) and micronized vaginal progesterone (MVP) are combined as luteal phase support (LPS) in a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) frozen ET (FET) cycles. Retrospective study, including single euploid HRT FET cycles with DYD and MVP as LPS and P4 measurement on ET day. Initially, patients with P4 levels < 10 ng/ml increased MVP to 400 mg/day; this ""rescue"" was abandoned later. 560 cycles of 507 couples were included. In 275 women, serum P4 level was < 10 ng/ml on the ET day. Among those with low P4 levels, MVP dose remained unchanged in 65 women (11.6%) and was increased in 210 women (37.5%). Women with P4 levels ≥ 10 ng/ml continued LPS without modification. Overall pregnancy rates in these groups were 61.5% (40/65), 54.8% (115/210), and 48.4% (138/285), respectively (p = n.s.). Association of serum P4 levels with ongoing pregnancy rates was analyzed in women without any additional MVP regardless of serum P4 levels (n = 350); multivariable analysis (adjusted for age, BMI, embryo quality (EQ)) did not show a significant association of serum P4 levels with OPR (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90-1.02; p = 0.185). Using inverse probability treatment weights, regression analysis in the weighted sample showed no significant association between P4 treatment groups and OP. Compared to fair EQ, the transfer of good EQ increased (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.15; p = 0.001) and the transfer of a poor EQ decreased the odds of OP (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97; p = 0.029). In HRT FET cycle, using LPS with 300 mg/day MVP and 30 mg/day DYD, it appears that serum P4 measurement and increase of MVP in patients with P4 < 10 ng/ml are not necessary.",['Lawrenz B; Kalafat E; Ata B; Del Gallego R; Melado L; Elkhatib I; Fatemi H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38372882,dydrogesterone and micronized vaginal progesterone combined as luteal phase support. 560 cycles of 507 couples included. dydrogesterone and micronized vaginal progesterone combined as luteal phase support.
The prevalence of menstrual disorders and their association with psychological stress in Syrian students enrolled at health-related schools: A cross-sectional study.,"Menstrual disorders are among the most prevalent health issues among young female students studying in health science faculties. This study aimed to provide insights into the menstrual patterns among medical faculty students and determine whether stress can be a risk factor for its various disorders. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy at the Syrian Private University, Damascus, Syria, between October and November 2022. A total of 980 female students anonymously completed the identification of menstrual problems and the perceived stress scale (PSS) questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS-25. The mean age of students was 21.52 ± 2.06 years. The most common menstrual disorders in this study were dysmenorrhea (88%), and premenstrual syndrome (87%). A total of 82% had mild to moderate stress, 10% had high stress, and 8% had low stress. Moderate to high perceived stress was associated with an increased risk of PMS (OR = 1.79, P = 0.0037). These findings stress the importance of universities, especially health science faculties, establishing protocols for early detection and intervention in students with stress and menstrual disorders. Implementing stress reduction education and timely counseling, along with preventive measures, is crucial for students' well-being. Further research is needed to refine interventions for this group.",['Kahal F; Alshayeb S; Torbey A; Al Helwani O; Kadri S; Helwani A; Al-Habal S; Moufti M; Johari M; Aldarra A; Alswaedan G; Albaghajati S; Sarraj H; Ataya S; Mansour M; Sakka K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37743817,menstrual disorders are among the most prevalent health issues among young female students studying in health science faculties. study aimed to provide insights into the menstrual patterns among medical faculty students and determine whether stress can be a risk factor for its various disorders.
Development and validation of the Self-Efficacy in Addressing Menstrual Needs Scale (SAMNS-26) in Bangladeshi schools: A measure of girls' menstrual care confidence.,"Qualitative studies have described girls' varying levels of confidence in managing their menstruation, with greater confidence hypothesized to positively impact health, education, and social participation outcomes. Yet, measurement of this and other psychosocial components of adolescent girls' menstrual experiences has been weak in global health research, in part due to a dearth of appropriate psychometric tools. We describe the development and validation of the Self-Efficacy in Addressing Menstrual Needs Scale (SAMNS-26). We conducted nine focus group discussions with girls in schools in rural and urban Bangladesh to identify tasks involved in menstrual self-care. This informed our creation of an initial pool of 50 items, which were reviewed by menstrual health experts and refined through 21 cognitive interviews with schoolgirls. Using a self-administered survey, we administered 34 refined items plus additional validation measures to a random sample of 381 post-menarcheal girls (ages 9-17) and retested a subsample of 42 girls two weeks later. We examined the measure's dimensionality using exploratory factor analysis and assessed internal consistency, temporal stability, and construct validity. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a 26-item scale comprising three correlated sub-scales: the 17-item Menstrual Hygiene Preparation and Maintenance (α = 0.86), the 5-item Menstrual Pain Management (α = 0.87), and the 4-item Executing Stigmatized Tasks (α = 0.77). Sub-scales exhibited good temporal stability. SAMNS-26 scores correlated negatively with measures of anxiety, and girls who preferred to stay at home during their periods had lower SAMNS-26 scores than those who did not. The SAMNS-26 provides a reliable measure of a schoolgirl's confidence in her capabilities to address her menstrual needs. There is initial evidence to support the measure's construct validity in the Bangladesh context as indicated by its relationships with other factors in its theorized nomological network. The tool enables incorporation of self-efficacy into multivariate models for exploring the relationships among antecedents to menstrual experiences and hypothesized impacts on health, wellbeing, and education attainment. Further testing of the tool is recommended to strengthen evidence of its validity in additional contexts.",['Hunter EC; Murray SM; Sultana F; Alam MU; Sarker S; Rahman M; Akter N; Mobashara M; Momata M; Winch PJ'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36201478,adolescent girls' menstrual experiences have been weak in global health research. adolescent girls' menstrual experiences have been a key component of menstrual self-care.
Simulation-based caregiving skills training for family members of high-grade glioma patients.,"Because family caregivers of patients with a high-grade glioma experience high levels of distress and feel unprepared to perform the complex caregiving tasks associated with the disease and its treatment, we pilot-tested a caregiving skills intervention that integrates hands-on caregiving with coping skill training. In this single-arm trial, caregivers participated in a 4-session research nurse-led intervention involving simulation-based caregiving skills training at the hospital and psychoeducation delivered via videoconference. We collected measures of patients' and caregivers' psychological symptoms; caregivers' caregiving self-efficacy and role adjustment; and patients' cancer-related symptoms (MDASI) at baseline and again postintervention. We tracked feasibility data. We approached 29 dyads of which 10 dyads (34%) consented. All patients (mean age: 60 years, 89% male) and caregivers (mean age: 58 years, 80% female, 80% spouses) completed the baseline and 7 dyads completed the follow-up assessments (attrition was related to patient's hospice transfer). Seven caregivers completed all 4 sessions and rated the program as beneficial. Paired <i>t</i>-tests revealed a significant improvement in caregiving self-efficacy at 6 weeks postintervention (<i>t</i> = -3.06, <i>P</i> = .02). Although improvements in caregiver role adjustment and patient and caregiver symptoms were not observed, no decreases in symptom burden or role adjustment were found during the follow-up period. This novel supportive care program appears to be safe, feasible, acceptable, and perceived as useful for caregivers of patients with high-grade glioma. Based on feasibility indicators and a signal of intervention efficacy, a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",['Whisenant M; Weathers SP; Li Y; Aldrich E; Ownby K; Thomas J; Ngo-Huang A; Bruera E; Milbury K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39006525,caregiving skills training for family members of high-grade glioma patients. caregivers participated in a 4-session research nurse-led intervention. we collected measures of patients' and caregivers' psychological symptoms.
Tracking intra-species and inter-genus transmission of KPC through global plasmids mining.,"Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) poses a major public health risk. Understanding its transmission dynamics requires examining the epidemiological features of related plasmids. Our study compiled 15,660 bla<sub>KPC</sub>-positive isolates globally over the past two decades. We found extensive diversity in the genetic background of KPC, with 23 Tn4401-related and 341 non-Tn4401 variants across 163 plasmid types in 14 genera. Intra-K. pneumoniae and cross-genus KPC transmission patterns varied across four distinct periods. In the initial periods, plasmids with narrow host ranges gradually established a survival advantage. In later periods, broad-host-range plasmids became crucial for cross-genera transmission. In total, 61 intra-K. pneumoniae and 66 cross-genus transmission units have been detected. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction dated the origin of KPC transmission back to 1991 and revealed frequent exchanges across countries. Our research highlights the frequent and transient spread events of KPC mediated by plasmids across multiple genera and offers theoretical support for high-risk plasmid monitoring.",['Cai M; Song K; Wang R; Wang S; Chen H; Wang H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38923465,"Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase poses a major public health risk. plasmids mining compiled 15,660 blasub>KPC/sub>-positive isolates globally."
Burden of early neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Globally, with a neonatal mortality rate of 27/1000 live births, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate in the world and is responsible for 43% of all infant fatalities. In the first week of life, almost three-fourths of neonatal deaths occur and about one million babies died on their first day of life. Previous studies lack conclusive evidence regarding the overall estimate of early neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this review aimed to pool findings reported in the literature on magnitude of early neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. This review's output is the aggregate of magnitude of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Up until June 8, 2023, we performed a comprehensive search of the databases PubMed/Medline, PubMed Central, Hinary, Google, Cochrane Library, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The studies were evaluated using the JBI appraisal check list. STATA 17 was employed for the analysis. Measures of study heterogeneity and publication bias were conducted using the I2 test and the Eggers and Beggs tests, respectively. The Der Simonian and Laird random-effect model was used to calculate the combined magnitude of early neonatal mortality. Besides, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta regression were carried out to identify the source of heterogeneity. Fourteen studies were included from a total of 311 articles identified by the search with a total of 278,173 participants. The pooled magnitude of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa was 80.3 (95% CI 66 to 94.6) per 1000 livebirths. Ethiopia had the highest pooled estimate of early neonatal mortality rate, at 20.1%, and Cameroon had the lowest rate, at 0.5%. Among the included studies, both the Cochrane Q test statistic (χ2 = 6432.46, P <0.001) and I2 test statistic (I2 = 99.80%, p <0.001) revealed statistically significant heterogeneity. Egger's weighted regression (p <0.001) and funnel plot show evidence of publication bias in this meta-analysis. This review demonstrated that the pooled magnitude of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is substantial. Therefore, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, international organizations, healthcare providers and institutions and academic and research institutions should give a due attention and design strategies to reduce early neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa.",['Moges N; Dessie AM; Anley DT; Zemene MA; Gebeyehu NA; Adella GA; Kassie GA; Mengstie MA; Seid MA; Abebe EC; Gesese MM; Kebede YS; Feleke SF; Dejenie TA; Tesfa NA; Bayih WA; Chanie ES; Bantie B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052580,"sub-saharan africa has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world. in the first week of life, almost three-fourths of neonatal deaths occur. in the first week of life, almost three-fourths of neonatal deaths occur."
Comparing gingival inflammation and salivary acidity to hormonal variation during menstruation.,"Hormonal changes are associated with healthy female in different stages of her life, such as menarche, pregnancy, and menopause. The main female hormones (i.e., Estrogen and progesterone) act as modulators and effectors during different phases of menstrual cycle. Additionally, these hormones were shown to affect the body inflammatory status. Few studies addressed gingivitis and female hormones. Although gingivitis main cause is dental biofilm, female hormones might modulate this inflammation. If no treatment provided, gingivitis might proceed to periodontitis and alveolar bone destruction may appear. was to assess the changes in gingival inflammation, and salivary pH in relation to changes in hormonal levels during different menstrual phases in young females. 25 healthy young females with regular menstrual cycles were included. The volunteers were invited to visit the clinic during their 2nd day of menstrual cycle (menses phase (MP)). During the visit, plaque index (PLI) and gingival index (GI) were scored. Additionally, salivary pH was calculated. Follow-up readings were taken on the 20th day of menstruation (pre-menstrual phase (PMP)). The difference in PLI, GI and salivary pH was analysed using <i>t</i>-test and chi-square test. The study showed that PLI and GI increased statistically significantly with increasing levels of female hormones during PMP and decreased during MP (P-value = 0.012 for PLI and 0.0003 for GI). Salivary pH decreases slightly during PMP and saliva becomes more alkaline during MP (P-value = 0.015). The study showed increased gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation during the premenstrual period. It is recommended to raise awareness of gingival inflammation among adult females to prevent progressive changes of periodontitis. However, due to the limited sample size of this study, a comprehensive population-based study is needed to support the findings.",['Kamal Asaad N; Abbood HM'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37091273,menstrual hormones are associated with healthy females in different stages of her life. menstrual hormones are regulated by hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. menstrual hormones are regulated by hormones such as a sex hormone.
Natural helping functions of lay health advisors in breast cancer education.,"The Save Our Sisters Project builds on the roles of 95 ""natural helpers"" to increase mammography screening among older African American women in a NC county. Natural helpers are lay people to whom others naturally turn for advice, emotional support, and tangible aid. Findings from 14 focus group interviews showed that older women seek out these individuals when they have a female-specific concern, rather than or before seeking help from professionals. The characteristics of natural helpers, revealed in the findings, were used to identify and recruit them to become trained lay health advisors in breast cancer education. Through the SOS Project, natural helpers provide a community-based system of care and social support that complements the more specialized role of health professionals; linking them to women through places and ways that no health professional could begin to acquire. The three roles of lay health advisors are: (1) to assist individuals in their social networks with needs that are difficult for professionals to address; (2) to negotiate with professionals for support for the health system; and (3) to mobilize the resources of associations in their community to sustain support from the health system.",['Eng E; Smith J'],1995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7612900,"the save our sisters project builds on the roles of 95 ""natural helpers"" to increase mammography screening among older african american women. the characteristics of natural helpers were used to identify and recruit them to become trained lay health advisors in breast cancer education."
Demystifying the landscape of endometrial immune microenvironment in luteal-phase from cuprotosis: Implications for the mechanism and treatment of RPL.,"Adaptive changes in the endometrial immune microenvironment during the luteal phase are essential for pregnancy, and their abnormalities are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Nevertheless, the specific mechanism is still unknown. Cuprotosis, an innovatively discovered type of programmed cell death, provides us with a pioneering perspective to decipher the landscape of luteal-phase endometrial immune microenvironment in RPL. This study aimed to analyze the immune landscape of luteal-phase endometrial microenvironment in RPL and explore the association of cuprotosis with it through integrative bioinformatics analysis. The microarrays involving the luteal phase endometrial tissue of RPL were obtained from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of RPL were screened and key modules were detected by WGCNA. GO, KEGG, and GSEA immune enrichment analyses were performed on the DEGs in the most relevant modules to RPL. Then, the endometrial immune microenvironment landscape of RPL was analyzed, including immune infiltration analysis and correlation analysis between immune cells or immune functions. The interaction of cuprotosis-related genes (CRGs), the expression level between groups, the immune localization and their correlation with immune cells and immune function were analyzed. LASSO regression and Nomogram evaluated the diagnostic value of immune-related CRGS in RPL. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the RPL signature CRGs. And RPL samples were grouped according to the expression of 7 RPL signature CRGs through unsupervised clustering analysis. After that, we analyzed the expression level of CRGs and immune infiltration, as well as performed immune function enrichment analysis in subtypes. In addition, we also screened potential drugs that might act on CRGs to improve the pathological mechanism of RPL. In this study, we uncovered that DEGs and genes in key modules derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were involved in immune regulation. And the immune infiltration landscape of RPL was significantly different from healthy controls. Furthermore, six hub genes were screened from CRGs based on Cytohubba, and their expression profilings were verified in RPL and normal mouse samples. Besides, seven CRGs closely associated with the immune regulation of RPL were identified by Spearman correlation analysis, including SLC31A1, LIAS, DLD, DLAT, DBT, ATP7B, and ATP7A, named as immune-related CRGs. Furthermore, three subgroups clustered according to these seven genes showed significant differences in immune landscape, suggesting a remarkable effect of CRGs on immune regulation. Last but not least, we analyzed the regulation network of transcription factors, miRNAs, and CRGs, and screened potential compounds for the treatment of RPL by targeting CRGs. The abnormal endometrial immune microenvironment in the luteal phase was associated with the pathomechanism of RPL, and cuprotosis was closely involved in the immune microenvironment in the luteal phase endometrium of RPL. Collectively, this study revealed the potential contribution of CRGs to the pathogenesis of RPL, providing a novel breakthroughs in insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of RPL.",['Zhao X; Wang S; Du T; Jiang Y; Zhao Y; Ma Y; Shen D; Shen Y; Ma J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38253297,luteal-phase endometrial immune microenvironment in luteal-phase is analyzed. adapted changes in the endometrial immune microenvironment during the luteal phase are essential for pregnancy. recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.
Contemporary Issue: Health and Safety of Female Wrestlers.,"Female wrestling has grown exponentially over the past decade. Within the United States, 46 states now recognize female high school wrestling, and 153 colleges have programs. It is on track to become an NCAA championship-level sport in 2026. A primary health and safety risk among this cohort pertains to rapid weight loss strategies. These can lead to intentional caloric restriction and decreased body fatness, with the perceived goal of attaining a competitive advantage. Low energy availability and low body fatness are associated with a number of health concerns including menstrual dysfunction and loss of bone mineral density in girls and women. The current recommendation of 12% as a minimum for percentage body fat is very likely too low, opening the door for health perturbations among this population. The minimum threshold might more appropriately fall within the range of 18% to 20%. Body fat assessment methods, primarily skinfold measures that are used to guide weight class selection, have not been adequately validated among this population and therefore should be an area of research focus, while also exploring alternative assessment techniques. Further, we recommend that weight cycling, restrictive energy intake, and intentional dehydration be avoided. Research should assess the effects of frequent weight cycling (to ""make weight"") and prolonged periods of low body fat on the reproductive and bone health of these athletes. Finally, research and clinical evaluations on female wrestlers are limited, and we offer a list of research priorities for future investigation into this contemporary issue.",['Jagim AR; Moschelli JS; Woodroffe LM; Horswill CA; Bloomfield SA; Oppliger RA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941548,a number of health concerns include menstrual dysfunction and bone mineral density loss. a minimum of 12% for percentage body fat is very likely too low. research should assess the effects of frequent weight cycling.
"Dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, menstrual flow volume changes, and irregularities following COVID-19 vaccination and the association with vaccine skepticism: A retrospective observational study.","COVID-19 vaccines have provided fertile ground for research, especially with the unprecedented spread of misinformation about this disease and its vaccines. Among women, one of the most frequently reported side effects of the vaccine has been menstrual disturbance. To investigate the perceived impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the menstrual cycle. In addition, the research seeks to identify factors that could predispose certain individuals to experience these effects, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the interplay between vaccines and menstrual health. We conducted a retrospective observational cross-sectional study. Any woman of menstruating age who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and currently resides in Saudi Arabia was invited to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire compared menstruation characteristics-regularity, volume, intermenstrual bleeding, and dysmenorrhea-before and after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, taking into consideration possible predisposing factors such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, contraceptives, or period-blocking pills. Women without polycystic ovarian syndrome experienced less change in dysmenorrhea post-vaccine compared to those with polycystic ovarian syndrome (23.88% versus 37.78%, <i>p</i> = 0.045). Women using hormonal contraceptives were about two times more likely to experience changes in volume compared to those not using contraceptives (odds ratio = 2.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-3.57, <i>p</i> = 0.006). COVID-19 vaccine skeptics were about three times more likely to perceive changes in regularity post-vaccine compared to non-skeptics (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.79-4.90, <i>p</i> < 0.001). They were also three times more likely to perceive changes in volume post-vaccine (odds ratio = 3.04, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-4.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Our data suggest significant associations between COVID-19 skepticism, the use of hormonal contraceptives, and the reported post-vaccine menstrual disturbances.

"Period poverty, reuse needs, and depressive symptoms among refugee menstruators in Jordan's camps: a cross-sectional study.","Period poverty is a significant issue that impacts the physical and psychological well-being of menstruators worldwide which can further contribute to poor mental health outcomes. For menstruators living in refugee camps, access to menstrual hygiene products is often limited or non-existent, leading to increased anxiety, shame, and embarrassment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of the period poverty and to comprehensively analyze the association between period poverty, reusing menstrual products, and depressive symptoms among menstruators living in refugee camps in Jordan. A cross-sectional study surveyed refugee menstruators living in camps in Jordan, aged post-menarche to pre-menopause. Data collection included socio-demographics, menstrual practices, and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Period poverty was assessed through affordability and frequency of struggles with menstrual products. Chi-squared test, independent sample t-test, One Way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Post hoc, and logistic regression models were used in the analysis. The study included a diverse sample of 386 refugee menstruators living in camps in Jordan (mean age 32.43 ± 9.95, age range 13-55). Period poverty was highly prevalent, with 42.0% reporting monthly struggles to afford menstrual products, and 71.5% reusing menstrual products. Univariate analysis revealed that experiencing period poverty was significantly associated with a younger age of marriage, increased number of children, lower education level, lower mother and father education levels, unemployment, decreased monthly income, absence of health insurance, lower reuse need score, and increased PHQ-9 score (p < 0.05). Menstruators experiencing monthly period poverty were 2.224 times more likely to report moderate to severe depression compared to those without period poverty (95% CI 1.069-4.631, P = 0.033). This study highlights a significant association between period poverty and depressive symptoms among refugee menstruators in living in camps in Jordan, as high rates of period poverty were associated with a 2.2-fold increased likelihood of reporting moderate to severe depression.

Dynamics of usage of menstrual hygiene and unhygienic methods among young women in India: a spatial analysis.,"Menstruation, especially the menstrual cycle, is a vital sign for female adolescent health and maintaining menstrual hygiene is of utmost importance for menstruating girls and women. However, menstrual hygiene and management are issues that have not received adequate attention. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore spatial patterns of menstrual hygiene practices in India and to identify their socioeconomic and demographic determinants among women aged 15-24 years. The study utilized data from the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted during 2019-21 in India. The analysis was limited to 241,180 women aged 15-24 years. The statistical methods range from multinomial logistic regression, spatial autocorrelation in terms of Moran's I statistics, to spatial regression in order to understand the spatial dependence and clustering in different methods of menstrual practices across the districts of India. Almost half of the respondents (49.8 percent) reported using hygienic methods of bloodstain protection, while 22.7 percent still relied on unhygienic methods and 27.5 percent reported using both hygienic and unhygienic methods during their menstruation. Factors like age, place of residence, caste, religion, education, wealth index and toilet facility were found to be significantly associated with the use of unhygienic and both methods. It was also observed that the percentage of women practicing hygienic methods was predominantly higher in the Southern region. On the other hand, states like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar appeared to be hotspots for unhygienic menstrual practices. The univariate Moran's I value for unhygienic and both methods were 0.722 and 0.596, respectively, depicting high spatial autocorrelation across districts in India. In spatial regression, rural residence, illiteracy, poverty, and no toilet facility were found to be statistically significant predictors of the use of unhygienic method and both methods. Young women should be educated about the importance of menstrual hygiene practices and the physiological consequences of unhygienic practices. Furthermore, interventions should target socio-economically disadvantaged women to increase the use of sanitary napkins.",['Meher T; Sahoo H'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37932760,"study aimed to explore spatial patterns of menstrual hygiene practices in india. analysis limited to 241,180 women aged 15-24 years."
The hidden burden of dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls in Palestine refugee camps: a focus on well-being and academic performance.,"Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) is a condition that may have a profound effect on adolescent girls' health status and well-being. It can impede their engagement in daily activities and hamper their regular school attendance. This study aims to explore the relationship between dysmenorrhea, well-being, and academic performance among adolescent girls living in Palestine refugee camps in the West Bank and Jordan. We conducted a household survey between June and September 2019, with a total sample of 2737 adolescent girls 15 to 18 years old. Dysmenorrhea severity was assessed using the Working Ability, Location, Intensity, Duration of pain Dysmenorrhea scale (WaLIDD). The WHO-5 scale was used to evaluate the girls' overall well-being. Menstrual academic disruption (MAD) was measured using a self-reported scale. Multiple linear regression models were employed to evaluate the association between dysmenorrhea, well-being, and academic performance. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) were employed to identify variables for control in regression models. The mean dysmenorrhea score was 6.6 ± 2.6, with 37.9% and 41.2% expressing moderate and severe symptoms, respectively. The mean WHO-5 score was 58.7 ± 25.1, and 34.9% reported a low well-being status. The mean MAD score was 3.1 ± 3.3. 26% reported missing school due to dysmenorrhea, 36% said dysmenorrhea impacted their ability to concentrate, and 39% were unable to study for tests, and complete homework. The first regression analysis showed a reduction of 1.45 units in WHO-5 score for each unit increase in dysmenorrhea. The second regression analysis showed a non-linear increase in MAD score for increasing dysmenorrhea. For each dysmenorrhea score less than 4 (mild) there was a modest increase in MAD scores (coefficient 0.08, p-value = 0.006), and for each dysmenorrhea score above 4 there was a stronger increase in MAD scores (coefficient 0.95, p < 0.001). Dysmenorrhea poses significant challenges to the well-being and academic performance of adolescent girls living in Palestine refugee camps. Collaborative efforts and multifaceted approaches are crucial to address dysmenorrhea effectively. This involves research, targeted interventions, culturally sensitive strategies, and fostering a supportive environment that empowers girls to thrive academically and beyond.",['Ghandour R; Hammoudeh W; Stigum H; Giacaman R; Fjeld H; Holmboe-Ottesen G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38448826,dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) is a condition that may have profound effect on adolescent girls' health status and well-being. it can impede their engagement in daily activities and hamper their regular school attendance.
Impact of Experimental Tuberculosis on Fertility of Female BALB/c Mice.,"The study revealed no effects of pregnancy and childbirth on the course of tuberculosis in female BALB/c mice after aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, we demonstrated a negative effect of tuberculosis infection on the fertility of infected females, which manifested in a longer period from mating to pregnancy and in a smaller litter size. Impaired reproductive function in response to the effect of the systemic infectious process was accompanied by the development of immunosuppression confirmed by an immunological test (delayed-type hypersensitivity to tuberculin) and the formation of genital tract dysbiosis during pregnancy and postpartum period.",['Kayukova SI; Karpina NL; Ulyumdzhieva VA; Semenova LA; Donnikov AE; Bocharova IV; Nikonenko BV'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39093472,study revealed no effects of pregnancy and childbirth on the course of tuberculosis in female BALB/c mice. but we demonstrated a negative effect of tuberculosis infection on the fertility of infected females.
"Maternal exposure to heat and its association with miscarriage in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: A population-based cohort study.","We sought to improve the current understanding of how climate change impacts women's reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the relationship between maternal heat exposure and miscarriage (pregnancy ending before 20 weeks gestation) in a South African setting. Population-based cohort study. Our study involved data for pregnancies collected via a health and demographic surveillance system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 2012 and 2016. Data from the South African Weather Service were used to compute maternal exposure to heat during the following time windows for each pregnancy: during the month preceding conception (T1) and during the week preceding the study outcome (either a miscarriage or no miscarriage, T2). Heat exposure was operationalized as a continuous variable and defined as the number of days that a mother was exposed to a mean daily temperature of > 26.6°C (A ""hot day,"" equivalent to a mean daily temperature of > 80°F) during T1 or T2. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between maternal heat exposure and miscarriage. A total of 105/3477 pregnancies included in our analysis ended in miscarriage (3.0%). Each additional hot day during T1 was associated with a 26% higher odds of miscarriage (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-1.38). No significant associations were observed between maternal heat exposure during T2 and the odds of miscarriage (odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.20). The relationship between maternal heat exposure during T1 and the odds of miscarriage was J-shaped. There is a clear relationship between maternal heat exposure during the month preceding conception and miscarriage in our sub-Saharan African setting. Given the lack of feasible strategies to reduce pregnancy loss associated with prevailing high temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa, progressive climate change will likely exacerbate existing challenges for women's reproductive health in this region.",['Moodley Y; Asare K; Tanser F; Tomita A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066467,"maternal heat exposure and miscarriage in rural KwaZulu-Natal, south africa. heat exposure was operationalized as a continuous variable. heat exposure was defined as the number of days that a mother was exposed to a mean daily temperature of > 26.6°C during T1 or T2."
Periods Shouldn't Bring Any Adolescents' World to a Full Stop. Period. An Online Survey of Adolescents' Experience of Menstruation.,"Few studies have explored what specific outcome measures contained in assessment tools for period and pelvic pain are most relevant to adolescents. Co-design is a valuable method of ensuring input from those with lived experience. The Longitudinal Study of Teenagers with Endometriosis Periods and Pelvic Pain in Australia (LongSTEPPP) Co-Design Periods Survey comprised an anonymous online survey of adolescents' experience of menstruation to inform patient-reported outcome measures for the larger 5-year project. Adolescents aged 12-18 years whose periods had commenced at least 3 months previously and with demonstrated capacity to consent were invited to participate in an online survey. Recruitment was primarily via social media channels. Of the 1811 adolescents who participated, 85% reported that periods had a ""moderate"" or greater impact on their life. Pain (90.7%), heavy flow (56.2%), and worry about leakage (49%) were common reasons for missed activities. Menstrual symptoms were wide-ranging and included cramping, nausea, poor energy, and impacts on mood. When asked where adolescents sought assistance with their periods, 39.8% had seen their general practitioner, 21.3% their school nurse, and almost 1 in 10 had consulted a mental health practitioner (9.3%). To manage menstrual symptoms, heat packs (66.0%), over-the-counter medications (55.8%), and prescription medications (28.6%) were used. We found a lack of menstrual health awareness in adolescents. Periods had a significant effect on their lives, and adolescents commonly missed activities. In managing menstruation, a wide range of practitioners were consulted. Nearly a third were prescribed medication to manage their periods. These findings have directed the longitudinal study as to how best to capture outcome measures that reflect the impact of periods on adolescents.",['Munro CB; Walker EN; Schembri R; Moussaoui D; Grover SR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37722525,an online survey of adolescents' experience of menstruation was conducted. the survey included an anonymous online survey of adolescents' experience of menstruation. the survey was conducted by a group of 1811 adolescents.
Similar outcomes in collision athletes with subcritical glenoid bone loss and on-Track Hill Sachs lesion versus off-track Hill Sachs lesion managed with open Bankart repair plus inferior capsular shift.,"Open Bankart repair plus inferior capsular shift has not yet been tested under the concept of glenoid track as a predictor of failure. The aim of this study was to compare the subjective and objective outcomes in collision athletes with subcritical glenoid bone loss and on-track Hill Sachs lesions versus those with off-track Hill Sachs lesions, all treated with open Bankart repair. Two study groups were created: 50 patients had on-track Hill Sachs lesions, while 38 had off-track lesions. The subcritical glenoid bone loss was ≤ 10%. A minimum follow-up period of 3 years was established. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of each group and between them was performed. The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index score and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scale were used to assess subjective outcomes. Recurrence rate, range of motion and return to sport were evaluated as objective outcomes. Significant differences were reported in the WOSI and ASES scores between preoperative and postoperative values in each group. There were no significant differences between the two groups (p-value = 0.36 and 0.71). Three dislocations (6%) in the on-track group and 3 (7.8%) in the off-track group were recorded, showing no differences between the two groups (p-value = 0.83). There were no differences in ROM between pre- and post-operatively in each group or when comparing the two groups. We found no differences between the outcomes of the two groups.

Reproductive Considerations in the Transgender and Gender Diverse Population: A Review.,"Many transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals will be considering gender-affirming treatments during their reproductive lifespan. These medically necessary treatments have a negative impact on reproductive potential. All TGD individuals should be counseled regarding fertility. Options for fertility preservation for individuals who have undergone puberty include mature oocyte, embryo, and sperm cryopreservation. In prepubertal individuals, ovarian tissue cryopreservation may be considered, but testicular tissue cryopreservation remains experimental only.

Chronic fatigue in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-Hypermobile type.,"Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia, hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co-morbid conditions that result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional support, as well as providing on-going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about proposed treatments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[""Hakim A; De Wandele I; O'Callaghan C; Pocinki A; Rowe P""]",2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28186393,chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. there is overlap in symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. a proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified.
"The Impact of Sleeve Gastrectomy on Females With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome From 2018 to 2020 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Prospective Study.","Obesity is one of the most common risk factors for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Reducing body weight has shown to improve the symptoms of PCOS; however, it is still unclear if the surgical treatment of obesity can have better outcomes to control obesity and improve PCOS. This study aims to identify the impact of sleeve gastrectomy on PCOS symptoms in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with a comparison of other weight reduction surgeries. This is a prospective study that included patients with PCOS who had weight reduction surgeries between 2018 and 2020, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Using an online questionnaire, demographic data will be collected and information about menstruation, abortion, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and bariatric surgeries (if any). Data analysis was done through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Ninety-nine female patients responded to this survey, all of whom had PCOS; 57.6% of these patients had a positive family history of PCOS. The most-reported PCOS symptoms were irregular menses (63.6%) and weight gain (53.5%), while 9.1% were asymptomatic. 52.5% were obese, and 91.1% underwent gastric sleeve surgery to treat their obesity. 41.4% of the females had a regular cycle before the operation, which increased to 60.6% after the operation; 48.5% had a normal flow before the operation, which increased to 61.6% after the operation. 15.2% conceived once before the operation, which increased to 16.2% after the operation. 11.1% had one abortion before surgery, which decreased to 7.1% after surgery. 55.6% observed an improvement in their PCOS symptoms after surgery, and 47.5% found that their fertility improved according to their own perception. Females with a positive family history of PCOS had a higher prevalence of PCOS (p-value <0.001). Also, females 30-39 years old are significantly more likely to have PCOS (p-value <0.001). The incidence of abnormal menstrual flow and irregular menstrual cycle was seen significantly more in PCOS patients than non-PCOS (p-value=0.019 and 0.004, respectively). PCOS symptoms and fertility significantly improved after surgery (p-value=0.031 and 0.043, respectively). Sleeve gastrectomy can lead to significant improvement in fertility and symptoms of PCOS. It can also reduce the incidence of abortion.

Interventions for improving the health and socioeconomic well-being of young parents in Africa: a systematic review protocol.,"Early childbearing is highly prevalent in Africa. Despite the harmful consequences of early childbearing on young people, there is limited documentation of interventions that aim to improve the health and socioeconomic well-being of young parents on the continent. In this systematic review, we will map and provide a critical synthesis of interventions that aim to improve the health and socioeconomic well-being of young parents in Africa to inform future policy and programmatic decision-making. The systematic review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We will conduct an electronic search of peer-reviewed articles published in six databases: PubMed, Science Direct, AJOL, JSTOR, ERIC and Google Scholar. We will also search for grey literature through Google search and organisations' websites to broaden the number of interventions retrieved. Articles will be included if (1) the study participants are young mothers and fathers aged 10-24 years, (2) the article reports on interventions targeting young mothers and fathers in Africa or individual countries in Africa, (3) the article is published in English or French, (4) the article reports on health and socioeconomic well-being outcomes and (5) the article was published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2023.

T-2 toxin exposure induces ovarian damage in sows: lncRNA CUFF.253988.1 promotes cell apoptosis by inhibiting the SIRT3/PGC1α pathway.,"T-2 toxin, a mycotoxin found in foods and feeds, poses a threat to female reproductive health in both humans and animals. LncRNA CUFF.253988.1 (CUFF.253988.1), highly expressed in pigs, has an undisclosed regulatory role. This study aimed to establish a model of T-2 toxin-induced ovarian injury in sows, both in vivo and in vitro, and to explore the regulatory role and potential mechanisms of CUFF.253988.1. The results showed that feeding T-2 toxin-contaminated feed (1 mg/kg) induced ovarian follicle atresia and mitochondrial structural damage, accompanied by a significant upregulation of CUFF.253988.1 expression in the ovaries. Additionally, T-2 toxin inhibited the SIRT3/PGC1-α pathway associated with mitochondrial function. Moreover, T-2 toxin induced cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Cyt c, Bax, cleaved-caspase-9, and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins. In T-2 toxin-induced injury to the ovarian granulosa AVG-16 cells at concentrations of 10, 40 and 160 nM, not only were the previously mentioned effects observed, but also a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, and an elevation in ROS levels. However, downregulating CUFF.253988.1 reversed T-2 toxin's inhibition of the SIRT3/PGC1-α pathway, alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cell apoptosis. Notably, this may be attributed to the inhibition of T-2 toxin-induced enrichment of CUFF.253988.1 in mitochondria. In conclusion, CUFF.253988.1 plays a pivotal role in T-2 toxin-induced ovarian damage, operating through the inhibition of the SIRT3/PGC1-α pathway and promotion of cell apoptosis.",['Yang C; Fan H; Wu Y; Liang Z; Wang Y; Wu A; Li Y; Yuan Z; Yi J; Yin D; Wu J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39067079,"lncRNA CUFF.253988.1 promotes cell apoptosis by inhibiting the SIRT3/PGC1- pathway. ovarian granulosa AVG-16 cells at concentrations of c, c, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins."
Assessment of the Impact of a Short-Term Intervention on Menstrual Hygiene Practices of Adolescent Girls in Rural Parts of Central India.,"Introduction Menstruation affects many young girls in a negative way in relation to their physical and psychological health despite being a reasonably common issue in daily life. Their health relies on their learning about fundamental menstruation hygiene. They have a significant risk of developing ailments due to their lack of education in this area. Young girls can avoid several preventable illnesses by being educated about menstruation hygiene and practices. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the impact of a health education intervention on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of teenage girls about menstrual hygiene. Materials and methods The current educational interventional study design evaluates the impact of an educational intervention on menstrual hygiene in teenage females. Adolescent girls were educated about the practices and taboos related to menstruation. They were assessed using a pretest and post-test after the intervention. The results of the pre- and post-study tests were compared, and the effect of the intervention was determined. Result A noteworthy observation of the study was that only 87 (34.8%) teenage girls were aware of hygienic practices before menarche. The didactic lecture had a favorable impact, and after two months, 2.40% of the 6.80% of females who changed their reusable pads just once a week began replacing them every two days. Additionally, a shift in hygiene behaviors was noted; 17.20% of the 33.60% of individuals started washing their hands with soap and water after changing their menstruation pads, which was significant (p=0.05). Conclusion The study assessed the impact of a short-term intervention on the menstrual habits practiced by adolescent girls. We concluded that an intervention in the form of educational counseling can significantly impact the menstrual hygiene practices of adolescent girls. Teaching teenage females resulted in a considerable improvement in their menstruation habits, which has a beneficial overall effect.",['Vagha K; Sawhney S; Varma A; Vagha JD; Mishra N'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37818519,study aims to assess impact of a short-term intervention on menstrual hygiene in teenage girls. a pre- and post-study test was used to assess the impact of the intervention.
Repeated use of pre- and postcoital hormonal contraception for prevention of pregnancy.,"Repeated use of postcoital hormonal contraception is not currently recommended due to the higher risk of side effects and lower contraceptive effectiveness compared to other modern methods of contraception. However, emerging evidence indicates renewed interest in a regular coitally-dependent method of oral contraception. We evaluated the existing data on safety and effectiveness of pericoital use of levonorgestrel and other hormonal drugs to prevent pregnancy. To determine the effectiveness and safety of repeated use of pre- and postcoital hormonal contraception for pregnancy prevention. We searched until 1 September 2014 for trials that tested repeated pre- and postcoital use of hormonal drugs for pregnancy prevention. Databases included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and POPLINE. We searched for current trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. For the initial review, we also searched EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS, and wrote to researchers to identify other trials. We considered published and unpublished studies of repeated postcoital or immediately precoital use of hormonal drugs for contraception with pregnancy as an outcome. Two authors independently confirmed eligibility and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated confidence intervals (CI) around individual study Pearl indices using a Poisson distribution. We presented individual study estimates and pooled estimates and their 95% CI, where appropriate. We found 22 trials that evaluated pericoital use of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy. The studies included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs and doses evaluated included levonorgestrel (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in doses other than 0.75 mg (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability.Pericoital levonorgestrel was reasonably efficacious and safe. The pooled Pearl Index for the 0.75 mg dose of LNG was 5.4 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.1 to 7.0). The pooled Pearl Index for all doses of LNG was 5.0 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.4 to 5.6). Other hormonal drugs appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effects reported. However, the studies provided no consistent evidence of a relationship between bleeding abnormalities and either frequency of pill intake or total dose of the drug. Non-menstrual side effects were reportedly mild and not tabulated in most studies. Most women liked the pericoital method in spite of frequent menstrual irregularities. The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues. Most reports were decades old and provided limited information. However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies. Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception among women with infrequent intercourse. If the method is shown to be efficacious, safe and acceptable, the results may warrant revision of the current World Health Organization recommendations and marketing strategies.",['Halpern V; Raymond EG; Lopez LM'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25259677,repeated use of pre- and postcoital hormonal contraception is not currently recommended. emerging evidence indicates renewed interest in a regular coitally-dependent method of oral contraception.
The Implication of Mechanistic Approaches and the Role of the Microbiome in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): A Review.,"As a complex endocrine and metabolic condition, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects women's reproductive health. These common symptoms include hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, irregular menstruation, and infertility. No one knows what causes it or how to stop it yet. Alterations in gut microbiota composition and disruptions in secondary bile acid production appear to play a causative role in developing PCOS. PCOS pathophysiology and phenotypes are tightly related to both enteric and vaginal bacteria. Patients with PCOS exhibit changed microbiome compositions and decreased microbial diversity. Intestinal microorganisms also alter PCOS patient phenotypes by upregulating or downregulating hormone release, gut-brain mediators, and metabolite synthesis. The human body's gut microbiota, also known as the ""second genome,"" can interact with the environment to improve metabolic and immunological function. Inflammation is connected to PCOS and may be caused by dysbiosis in the gut microbiome. This review sheds light on the recently discovered connections between gut microbiota and insulin resistance (IR) and the potential mechanisms of PCOS. This study also describes metabolomic studies to obtain a clear view of PCOS and ways to tackle it.",['Mukherjee AG; Wanjari UR; Kannampuzha S; Murali R; Namachivayam A; Ganesan R; Dey A; Babu A; Renu K; Vellingiri B; Ramanathan G; Priya Doss C G; Elsherbiny N; Elsherbini AM; Alsamman AM; Zayed H; Gopalakrishnan AV'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36677054,"polycystic ovarian syndrome affects women's reproductive health. symptoms include hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction. phenotypes are tightly related to enteric and vaginal bacteria."

Risk factors for breast cancer among Indian women: A case-control study.,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females all over the world. The incidence of breast cancer is persistently on the rise due to urbanization and lifestyle changes. Although various risk factors have been suggested for estimating the risk of developing breast cancer, most of these have been studied in the Western population. A better understanding of local characteristics of risk factors may help in devising locally effective prevention strategies for breast cancer. The primary objective of the study was to study the risk factors for carcinoma breast among Indian women. This was a case-control study, conducted from January 2011 to December 2012, at a tertiary level teaching institution. A total of 100 patients of Indian origin, attending the General Surgery Department with carcinoma breast during this period were the cases. Controls were the blood relatives of patients with other diagnosed malignancies. The major risk factors for breast cancer are found to be age, diet, waist size, hip size, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, more than three pregnancies, number of years of menstruation, atypical hyperplasia in the previous biopsy, and history of carcinoma in relatives. Waist size and WHR are the major risk factors for carcinoma of breast.

"Female-specific education, management, and lifestyle enhancement for implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients: the FEMALE-ICD study.","Significant rates of psychological distress occur in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. Research has demonstrated that women are particularly at risk for developing distress and warrant psychosocial attention. The major objectives were to implement and test the effectiveness of a female-specific psychosocial group intervention on disease-specific quality of life outcomes in outpatient female ICD recipients versus a wait-list control group. Twenty-nine women were recruited for the study. Fourteen women were randomized to the intervention group and participated in a psychosocial intervention focused on female-specific issues; 15 were randomized to the wait-list control group. All women completed individual psychological batteries at baseline and at 1-month follow-up measuring shock anxiety and device acceptance. Pre-post measures of shock anxiety demonstrated a significant time by group interaction effect with the intervention group having a significantly greater decrease (Pillai's trace = 5.58, P = 0.026). A significant interaction effect (Pillai's trace = 5.05, P = 0.046) was found, such that women under the age of 50 experienced greater reduction in shock anxiety than their middle-aged cohorts. Pre-post measures of device acceptance revealed a significant time by group interaction effect with the intervention group having significantly greater increases (Pillai's trace = 5.80, P = 0.023). Structured interventions for female ICD patients involving ICD-specific education, cognitive behavioral therapy strategies, and group social support provide improvements in shock anxiety and device acceptance at 1-month re-assessment.

Correlation of perceived stress with monthly cyclical changes in the female body.,"Women are liable to stress-related disorders as female sex hormone, estrogen has been indicated to be protective against stress disorders. The hormone level varies with different phases of menstrual cycle. Moreover, postmenopausal women are at risk for stress-related disorders. So this study was done to correlate the different phases of menstrual cycle with the perceived stress in different phases of monthly cycle. This study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Shri Guru Ram Rai Institute of Medical and Health Sciences (SGRRIMHS), Dehradun. Four hundred girls in the age group of 18-26 years were selected for the study. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire was circulated via Google forms after briefing them about the study. Informed consent was also taken. The menstrual history of the subjects was enquired by one-to-one interaction. The participants completed the PSS questionnaire twice in the same cycle. Data collected were statistically analyzed, using Independent <i>t</i>-test and Chi-square test and point biserial correlation test. The analysis showed strong statistical association of PSS with two phases of menstrual cycle. The PSS score was higher in the late luteal and menstrual phase, while it was less in the late follicular phase (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Conclusion: The decreased oestrogen levels in the late luteal & menstrual phase are strongly associated with perceived stress in our study. Hormonal changes in the monthly cycles are related with stress, behavioral shift and many other physical changes in females. This information to the family physicians would be beneficial in counseling the females regarding various changes occurring during the menstrual cycle.",['Jain P; Chauhan AK; Singh K; Garg R; Jain N; Singh R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38186841,"women are liable to stress-related disorders as female sex hormone, estrogen. hormone level varies with different phases of menstrual cycle. postmenopausal women are at risk for stress-related disorders."
Promoting menstrual health among persian adolescent girls from low socioeconomic backgrounds: a quasi-experimental study.,"Research in the past decade has revealed average to poor menstrual health among many Iranian girls. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a health promotion project on improving menstrual health in adolescent girls in Iran. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the health intervention program. A total of 698 students (study participants and controls) in several schools in Mazandaran province, Iran were included. The project comprised 10 two-hour educational sessions. Educational topics included the significance of adolescence, physical and emotional changes during adolescence, pubertal and menstruation health and premenstrual syndrome. A self-administered questionnaire measuring demographic characteristics, behaviors during menstruation, menstrual patterns, sources of information about menstruation and personal health data was administered. The questionnaire was administered to all participating students after the experimental group received the training. Among the most significant results was the impact of educational sessions on bathing and genital hygiene. A total of 61.6% in the experimental group compared with 49.3% in the control group engaged in usual bathing during menstruation (p = 0.002). Individual health status was significantly statistically correlated with menstrual health. Attitude towards menstruation was also significantly related to menstrual health. The present study confirms that educational interventions, such as the health promotion project in this study, can be quite effective in promoting menstrual health.",['Fakhri M; Hamzehgardeshi Z; Hajikhani Golchin NA; Komili A'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22420743,"study investigated effectiveness of health promotion project on improving menstrual health in adolescent girls in Iran. a total of 698 students (study participants and controls) in several schools in Mazandaran province, Iran were included. educational topics included the significance of adolescence, physical and emotional changes during adolescence, pubertal and menstruation health and premenstrual syndrome."
Vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a review.,"A common health problem known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), is characterized by irregular periods, an excess of androgen production, and polycystic ovaries. It is one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age, affecting 4-20% of women worldwide. Numerous studies have found a connection between the onset and symptoms of PCOS and Vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency causes calcium dysregulation and follicular arrest in women with PCOS, which is connected to menstrual irregularities and fertility issues. Studies have connected PCOS metabolic alterations to VDR polymorphisms such as iApa-I, Taq-I, Cdx2, and Fok-I. Insulin resistance is directly related to Vitamin D, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the PCOS phenotype. Thus, it is suggested that Vitamin D therapy may help PCOS patients with their insulin sensitivity. In addition to insulin resistance, cardiovascular issues are a second metabolic disturbance that PCOS patients with low Vitamin D levels experience. Dyslipidemia is not linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in PCOS-affected women. Vitamin D dramatically improves glucose metabolism by increasing insulin production, insulin receptor expression and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effect of Vitamin D on the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions associated with PCOS may be mediated by an overall impact on insulin resistance. Vitamin D supplementation improved menstrual periods, increased folliculogenesis, and decreased blood testosterone levels in PCOS patients, all of which had a significant impact on the ability to procreate. As a result, it might be a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating PCOS concurrently.",['Mohan A; Haider R; Fakhor H; Hina F; Kumar V; Jawed A; Majumder K; Ayaz A; Lal PM; Tejwaney U; Ram N; Kazeem S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427232,vitamin D insufficiency causes calcium dysregulation and follicular arrest. vitamin D insufficiency causes calcium dysregulation and follicular arrest. vitamin D insufficiency is linked to menstrual irregularities and fertility issues.
Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire: assessing the influence of heavy menstrual bleeding on quality of life.,"Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), has a negative impact on women's quality of life (QOL). The objective was to develop, validate, and assess the performance of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement instrument for HMB (the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire [MIQ]). The MIQ was designed to measure the effect of HMB on a woman's self-assessment of menstrual blood loss (MBL), limitations in social/leisure activities, physical activities, and ability to work. Meaningfulness of these observed MBL changes were also measured. The development and psychometric validation of the MIQ was performed utilizing data from a long-term safety study of tranexamic acid (Lysteda * *Lysteda is a registered trade name of Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA. ), with comparison to an age-matched normal control group recruited from the general population. Performance of the MIQ was also evaluated using data from a six-cycle, randomized, double-blind, clinical study of tranexamic acid for the treatment of HMB. Correlations and sensitivity of each pertinent MIQ item to the treatment-induced changes in MBL were assessed, and the minimally important differences (MID) for the individual MIQ items were determined. The psychometric properties of the MIQ were fully validated. Correlations between individual MIQ items and changes in MBL were statistically significant (p < 0.001). A clear differentiation between tranexamic acid and placebo groups confirmed sensitivity of the MIQ and its ability to detect treatment-induced changes in MBL. MIDs were estimated for the individual MIQ items, with sensitivities and specificities in the 64-79% and 63-82% ranges using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, respectively. MIDs were found to be equal to or greater than 0.5. Statistically significant treatment differences were also observed for the proportions of subjects achieving at least 1-point improvement in MIQ scores. The MIQ contains validated constructs important to women with HMB.

Menstrual Hygiene Practice among Rural Adolescent School Girls: An Intervention Study.,"Menstruation, an essential part of the reproductive cycle, is experienced by all adolescent girls. Poor menstrual hygiene is associated with serious ill-health and drop-out from school. An intervention study was carried out to evaluate the outcome of health education on menstrual hygiene practice among randomly selected 45 adolescent girls attending in a purposively selected Shomospur Girls' High School, Khoksha at Kushtia district in 2018. Data were collected before and after intervention by pre-tested, semi-structured interview schedule with a view to explore the practice during menstruation. Majority 23(51.11%) subjects were between 10 to 14 years of age with a mean of 14.42±1.03 years. Mean age at menarche was 12.38±1.15 years. During menstrual period, adolescent girls used to refrain from performing daily household chores (34), skip from attending school (26), stay alone (26) and avoid to mix with others (25). Over two-thirds 31(68.89%) girls forbade nutritious foods like fish, meat, egg and tamarinds. As many as 39(86.67%) girls used to clean their genitalia, and everybody used to have regular bath and washing hands after changing menstrual absorbent. Generally, most of the girls (39, 86.67%) accustomed to use the reusable absorbent. Nearly one third 15(33.33%) girls used to dry the reusable absorbent in room corner, while 5(11.11) in shaded area and 3(6.67%) in the toilet. A considerable number of girls (12) stored the reusable materials in room corner and under the bed. At least 27(60.00%) girls did not use to change menstrual absorbent at school. While after intervention, none of the girls hesitated to attend others and felt safe to perform daily household chores. Moreover, they were confident to attend school and need not to stay alone during menstruation. Cent percent girls practiced to have food containing iron, vitamin C, and drank plenty of water. Warm water with soap and/or detergent was used for cleaning sanitary cloths. An overwhelming number 42(93.33%) of girls used to dry reusable materials in sunlight with a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Change of behaviour as to frequency of changing sanitary pad (p<0.05) and methods of disposal of sanitary materials was revealed. It can be concluded that imparting knowledge to adolescent girls is effective to keep away from harmful social behaviours, food intake practice and use of sanitary napkin, replace of menstrual absorbent at regular interval and cleaning and storage of reusable sanitary materials with their hygienic disposal.",['Khandaker S; Kabir S; Rahman MR; Toaha MM; Ferdoshi N; Islam F; Basher MS'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999687,menstrual hygiene is an essential part of the reproductive cycle. poor menstrual hygiene is associated with serious ill-health and drop-out from school.
A Case Series of Potential Pediatric Cyanotoxin Exposures Associated with Harmful Algal Blooms in Northwest Ohio.,"Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are increasing in prevalence and severity in the Great Lakes region, as well as both globally and locally. CyanoHABs have the potential to cause adverse effects on human health due to the production of cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria. Common routes of exposure include recreational exposure (swimming, skiing, and boating), ingestion, and aerosolization of contaminated water sources. Cyanotoxins have been shown to adversely affect several major organ systems contributing to hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal distress, and pulmonary inflammation. We present three pediatric case reports that coincided with CyanoHABs exposure with a focus on presentation of illness, diagnostic work-up, and treatment of CyanoHAB-related illnesses. Potential cyanotoxin exposure occurred while swimming in the Maumee River and Maumee Bay of Lake Erie in Ohio during the summer months with confirmed CyanoHAB activity. Primary symptoms included generalized macular rash, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe respiratory distress. Significant labs included leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. All patients ultimately recovered with supportive care. Symptoms following potential cyanotoxin exposure coincide with multiple disease states representing an urgent need to develop specific diagnostic tests of exposure.",['French BW; Kaul R; George J; Haller ST; Kennedy DJ; Mukundan D'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37987403,"potential cyanotoxin exposure occurred while swimming in the Maumee River and Maumee Bay of Lake Erie in Ohio during the summer months. primary symptoms included generalized macular rash, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe respiratory distress."
Adjuvant gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure in premenopausal women.,"This is an update of the original review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 11, and updated in 2015, Issue 4.Chemotherapy has significantly improved prognosis for women with malignant and some non-malignant conditions. This treatment, however, is associated with ovarian toxicity. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, both agonists and antagonists, may have a protective effect on the ovaries. The primary mechanism of action of GnRH analogues is to suppress the gonadotropin levels to simulate pre-pubertal hormonal milieu and subsequently prevent primordial follicles from maturation and therefore decrease the number of follicles that are more vulnerable to chemotherapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of GnRH analogues given before or in parallel to chemotherapy to prevent chemotherapy-related ovarian damage in premenopausal women with malignant or non-malignant conditions. The search was run for the original review in July 2011, and for the first update in July 2014. For this update we searched the following databases in November 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, which examined the effect of GnRH analogues for chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure in premenopausal women, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed binary data using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and for continuous data, we used the standardized mean difference (SMD) to combine trials. We applied the random-effects model in our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table for our main outcomes of interest. We included 12 RCTs involving 1369 women between the ages of 12 and 51.1 years. Participants were diagnosed with breast malignancy, ovarian malignancy, or Hodgkin's lymphoma, and most of them received alkylating, or platinum complexes, based chemotherapy. The included studies were funded by a university (n = 1), research centres (n = 4), and pharmaceutical companies (n = 1). Trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.Comparison 1: GnRH agonist plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy aloneThe incidence of menstruation recovery or maintenance was 178 of 239 (74.5%) in the GnRH agonist group and 110 of 221 (50.0%) in the control group during a follow-up period no longer than 12 months (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.24; 5 studies, 460 participants; I<sup>2</sup> = 79%; low-certainty evidence), with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH agonist (P = 0.006). However, we observed no difference during a follow-up period longer than 12 months between these two groups (P = 0.24). In the GnRH agonist group, 326 of 447 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (72.9%) in comparison to the control group, in which 276 of 422 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (65.4%) during a follow-up period longer than 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.22; 8 studies, 869 participants; I<sup>2</sup> = 56%; low-certainty evidence).The incidence of premature ovarian failure was 43 of 401 (10.7%) in the GnRH agonist group and 96 of 379 (25.3%) in the control group (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.61; 4 studies, 780 participants; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH agonist (P < 0.00001).The incidence of pregnancy was 32 of 356 (9.0%) in the GnRH agonist group and 22 of 347 (6.3%) in the control group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.70; 7 studies, 703 participants; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.09). However, we are cautious about this conclusion because there were insufficient data about whether the participants intended to become pregnant.The incidence of ovulation was 29 of 47 (61.7%) in the GnRH agonist group and 12 of 48 (25.0%) in the control group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.26; 2 studies, 95 participants; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low-certainty evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH (P = 0.001).The most common adverse effects of GnRH analogues included hot flushes, vaginal dryness, urogenital symptoms, and mood swings. The pooled analysis of safety data showed no difference in adverse effects between GnRH agonist group and control group.Comparison 2: GnRH agonist-antagonist cotreatment plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy aloneOnly one RCT discussed GnRH agonist-antagonist cotreatment. The limited evidence showed the incidence of menstruation recovery or maintenance was 20 of 25 (80%) in both cotreatment group and control group during a 12-month follow-up period (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 1.00). In the cotreatment group, 13 of 25 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (52.0%) in comparison to the control group, in which 14 of 25 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (56.0%) during a follow-up period longer than 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.55; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.78). The incidence of pregnancy was 1 of 25 (4.0%) in the cotreatment group and 0 of 25 (0%) in the control group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.30; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.49). GnRH agonist appears to be effective in protecting the ovaries during chemotherapy, in terms of maintenance and resumption of menstruation, treatment-related premature ovarian failure and ovulation. Evidence for protection of fertility was insufficient and needs further investigation. Evidence was also insufficient to assess the effect of GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist cotreatment on ovarian protection against chemotherapy. The included studies differed in some important aspects of design, and most of these studies had no age-determined subgroup analysis. Large and well-designed RCTs with longer follow-up duration should be conducted to clarify the effects of GnRH analogues in preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, especially on different age groups or different chemotherapy regimens. Furthermore, studies should address the effects on pregnancy rates and anti-tumour therapy.",['Chen H; Xiao L; Li J; Cui L; Huang W'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30827035,"the original review was published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011. it was updated in 2015, Issue 4. the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues may have a protective effect on the ovaries."
Effects of Hormonal Contraception and the Menstrual Cycle on Fatigability and Recovery From an Anaerobic Exercise Test.,"Cabre, HE, Ladan, AN, Moore, SR, Joniak, KE, Blue, MNM, Pietrosimone, BG, Hackney, AC, and Smith-Ryan, AE. Effects of hormonal contraception and the menstrual cycle on fatigability and recovery from an anaerobic exercise test. J Strength Cond Res 38(7): 1256-1265, 2024-This study sought to evaluate the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) and hormonal intrauterine device (H-IUD) use, compared with a eumenorrheic (EUM) cycle, on fatigability and recovery between hormone the phases. Peak power (PP), average power (AP), fatigue index (FI), blood lactate, vessel diameter, and blood flow (BF) were measured from a repeated sprint cycle test (10 × 6 seconds) in 60, healthy, active women (mean ± SD ; age: 26.5 ± 7.0 years, BMI: 22.5 ± 3.7 kg·m -2 ) who used monophasic OC (≥6 months; n = 21), had a H-IUD (≥6 months; n = 20), or had regular naturally occurring menstrual cycle (≥3 months) or had a nonhormonal IUD (EUM; n = 19). Subjects were randomly assigned to begin in either the low-hormone phase (LHP) or high-hormone phase (HHP) and were tested once in each phase. Separate univariate analyses of covariances assessed the change from HHP to LHP between the groups, covaried for progesterone, with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. All groups demonstrated similar changes in PP, AP, FI, blood lactate, vessel diameter, and BF between the phases ( p > 0.05). Although not significant, AP was higher in LHP for OC (Δ -248.2 ± 1,301.4 W) and EUM (Δ -19.5 ± 977.7 W) and higher in HHP for H-IUD (Δ 369.3 ± 1,123.0 W). Oral contraceptive group exhibited a higher FI (Δ 2.0%) and reduced blood lactate clearance (Δ 2.5%) in HHP. In recreationally active women, hormonal contraception and hormone phases may minimally impact fatigue and recovery. Individual elite female athletes may benefit from understanding hormonal contraception type as performance and recovery may slightly vary across the cycle.",['Cabre HE; Ladan AN; Moore SR; Joniak KE; Blue MNM; Pietrosimone BG; Hackney AC; Smith-Ryan AE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38598545,"effects of hormonal contraception and the menstrual cycle on fatigability and recovery from an anaerobic exercise test. a repeated sprint cycle test in 60 healthy, active women measured peak power (PP), average power (AP), fatigue index (FI), blood lactate, vessel diameter, and blood flow (BF)"
"Anticoagulant therapy for women: implications for menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation.","Estrogen exposure, in the setting of pregnancy, the postpartum state, combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), or hormone therapy use, has been clearly associated with increased rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although recurrence rates are low in these settings, up to 70% of anticoagulated menstruating individuals experience abnormal or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which commonly results in iron deficiency with or without anemia. Patients taking rivaroxaban appear to experience higher rates of HMB compared with those on apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin. HMB can often be diagnosed in a single visit with a good menstrual history assessing for factors with a known association with increased or heavy bleeding, such as changing pads or tampons more often than every 2 hours, clots larger than a quarter, and iron deficiency (ferritin <50  ng/mL). HMB can be managed with hormonal therapies, including those associated with VTE risk, such as CHCs and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). In many cases, continuing CHCs or DMPA while a patient is therapeutically anticoagulated is reasonable, so long as the therapy is discontinued before anticoagulation is stopped. Modification of the anticoagulation regimen, such as decreasing to a prophylactic dose in the acute treatment period, is not currently recommended. For patients who are currently pregnant, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is still standard of care during pregnancy; routine monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels is not currently recommended. Warfarin or LMWH may be considered in the postpartum setting, but direct-acting oral anticoagulants are currently not recommended for lactating patients.",['DeLoughery E; Bannow BS'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36485151,"up to 70% of anticoagulated menstruating individuals experience abnormal or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). rivaroxaban appears to experience higher rates of HMB compared with those on apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin."
The contribution of intimate partner violence to vertical HIV transmission: a modelling analysis of 46 African countries.,"Addressing gender inequities could be key to the elimination of vertical transmission of HIV. Women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) might be at an increased risk of vertical transmission due to their vulnerability to HIV acquisition and barriers to access to and retention in care. Sub-Saharan Africa, where IPV burden is among the highest globally, accounts for most new paediatric HIV infections. We aimed to examine the proportion of excess vertical transmission attributable to IPV in this region. In this modelling analysis, we created a probability tree model of vertical HIV transmission among women aged 15-49 years in 46 African countries. We estimated the proportion of vertical transmission attributable to past-year physical or sexual IPV, or both, as an age-standardised population attributable fraction (PAF) and as excess vertical transmission risk per 1000 births among women experiencing IPV. We incorporated perinatal and postnatal vertical transmission among women who acquired HIV before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding. Fertility, HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, and ART retention varied in the model by women's IPV experience. The model was parameterised using UNAIDS' 2023 Spectrum model data, WHO's Global Database on Violence Against Women, and the peer-reviewed literature. Uncertainty intervals (95% UI) were calculated through 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. Across 46 countries 13% (95% UI 6-21) of paediatric HIV infections in 2022 were attributed to IPV, corresponding to over 22 000 paediatric infections. The PAF ranged from 4% (2-7) in Niger to 28% (13-43) in Uganda. The PAF was highest among girls aged 15-19 years (20%, 8-33) and lowest among women aged 45-49 years (6%, 3-9). In southern Africa, where women's HIV prevalence is highest (23%), IPV led to 11 (5-20) additional infections per 1000 births among women affected by IPV. IPV might be responsible for one in eight paediatric HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Ending IPV could accelerate vertical transmission elimination, especially among young women who bear the highest burden of violence.

Physician infertility: a structured literature review.,"Physician infertility has become a growing concern because of the increasingly high rates of infertility physicians experience associated with their strenuous work schedules, environmental exposures, and delayed family planning due to their necessitated years of training. Fortunately, there has been an increase in awareness, advocacy, and urgency for institutional support alongside this suboptimal association. This awareness is reflected in the vast existing literature regarding physician infertility; in this scoping review, we aggregated and assessed the current data as well as identified gaps in the available research. Including 56 articles regarding various aspects of the current state of physician infertility, we compiled and synthesized the available data to understand the role of infertility in physician family planning, including specific analyses for surgeons and comparisons of male and female physicians. We discussed the utilization and downsides of artificial reproductive technologies for this population in terms of finances and logistics, contributing to this complex and, until recently, neglected issue.

Role of oxylipins in ovarian function and disease: A comprehensive review.,"Ovaries are essential for healthy female reproduction, with the follicles as their fundamental functional units, which consist of an oocyte and surrounding granulosa cells. The development and formation of follicles in the ovaries are closely linked to reproductive health. Oxylipins refer to oxidative metabolites produced from the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, either through automatic oxidation or with the help of specific enzymes. They play crucial regulatory roles in the immune system, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions and are intimately linked to the development of numerous illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, oxylipins have a complex relationship with ovarian function, and both prostaglandins and leukotrienes produced by arachidonic acid affect processes such as follicle growth and development, ovulation, and hormone regulation. The synthesis and metabolism of oxylipins in the ovaries are finely regulated. Oxylipin dysregulation has been linked to various ovarian diseases, including endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cancer, and premature ovarian insufficiency. In addition, potential therapeutic targets and interventions targeting the oxylipin pathway for the treatment of ovarian diseases have become a prominent research focus, including regulating the enzymes responsible for oxylipin synthesis, using anti-inflammatory agents, and regulating lipid metabolism. Recent research has been directed towards improving the reproductive outcomes of women with ovarian diseases through this series of interventions. An overview of the role of oxylipins in ovarian function and disease is provided in this article, which will aid researchers in understanding the current state of the field and in identifying future directions.",['Xu M; Liu D; Wang L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094547,"oxylipins are oxidative metabolites produced from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. they play crucial regulatory roles in the immune system, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions. oxylipin dysregulation has been linked to various ovarian diseases."
Myths and Methodologies: Standardisation in Human Physiology Research-Should We Control the Controllables?,"The premise of research in human physiology is to explore a multifaceted system whilst identifying one or a few outcomes of interest. Therefore, the control of potentially confounding variables requires careful thought regarding the extent of control and complexity of standardisation. One common factor to control prior to testing is diet, as food and fluid provision may deviate from participants' habitual diets, yet a self-report and replication method can be flawed by under-reporting. Researchers may also need to consider standardisation of physical activity, whether it be through familiarisation trials, wash-out periods, or guidance on levels of physical activity to be achieved before trials. In terms of pharmacological agents, the ethical implications of standardisation require researchers to carefully consider how medications, caffeine consumption and oral contraceptive prescriptions may affect the study. For research in females, it should be considered whether standardisation between- or within-participants in regards to menstrual cycle phase is most relevant. The timing of measurements relative to various other daily events is relevant to all physiological research and so it can be important to standardise when measurements are made.

Global prevalence of non-partner sexual violence against women.,"Sexual violence against women is a human rights violation and public health concern, with serious implications for women's physical and mental health. Reducing non-partner sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault and other forms of non-contact sexual abuse, is one of the main indicators of the sustainable development goals. World Health Organization estimates, based on available prevalence data from 137 countries between 2000 and 2018, showed that, globally, 6% of women aged 15-49 years reported experiencing sexual violence in their lifetime from someone other than an intimate partner, with prevalence rates varying across regions. However, the reporting, measurement and documentation of the global extent of non-partner sexual violence against women is methodologically challenging, resulting in a gross underestimation of its magnitude and impact. To prevent and respond to this issue, policy-makers must consider interventions on education, access to relevant health-care services, public awareness, and effective and comprehensive legislation. To better estimate the prevalence of both sexual violence overall and non-partner sexual violence, it is essential to continue to strengthen the measurement of non-partner sexual violence, including the types of acts asked about and the mode of interviewing. Further research is needed to understand the cumulative impact of different forms of sexual violence on the lives of women and girls, including sexual violence during childhood and its associated risk with further exposure. Funding is required for more research and implementation of interventions to prevent and reduce all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence.",['Sardinha L; Stöckl H; Maheu-Giroux M; Meyer SR; García-Moreno C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070596,6% of women aged 15-49 years reported experiencing sexual violence in their lifetime. a global prevalence of non-partner sexual violence against women is a human rights violation.
Land in limbo: Nearly one third of Indonesia's cleared old-growth forests left idle.,"Indonesia has experienced rapid primary forest loss, second only to Brazil in modern history. We examined the fates of Indonesian deforested areas, immediately after clearing and over time, to quantify deforestation drivers in Indonesia. Using time-series satellite data, we tracked degradation and clearing events in intact and degraded natural forests from 1991 to 2020, as well as land use trajectories after forest loss. While an estimated 7.8 Mha (SE = 0.4) of forest cleared during this period had been planted with oil palms by 2020, another 8.8 Mha (SE = 0.4) remained unused. Of the 28.4 Mha (SE = 0.7) deforested, over half were either initially left idle or experienced crop failure before a land use could be detected, and 44% remained unused for 5 y or more. A majority (54%) of these areas were cleared mechanically (not by escaped fires), and in cases where idle lands were eventually converted to productive uses, oil palm plantations were by far the most common outcome. The apparent deliberate creation of idle deforested land in Indonesia and subsequent conversion of idle areas to oil palm plantations indicates that speculation and land banking for palm oil substantially contribute to forest loss, although failed plantations could also contribute to this dynamic. We also found that in Sumatra, few lowland forests remained, suggesting that a lack of remaining forest appropriate for palm oil production, together with an extensive area of banked deforested land, may partially explain slowing forest loss in Indonesia in recent years.",['Parker D; Tosiani A; Yazid M; Sari IL; Kartika T; Firmansyah R; Said Z; Wijaya A; Potapov P; Tyukavina A; Stehman SV; Zalles V; Pickens A; Pickering J; Turubanova S; Hansen MC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38950360,nearly one third of Indonesia's cleared old-growth forests left idle. we tracked degradation and clearing events in intact and degraded natural forests.
Influence of COVID-19 infection/vaccination on menstrual regularity and hormonal function in Saudi females of reproductive age.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on women's health, particularly on their menstrual cycles. The menstrual cycle serves as a crucial indicator of fertility and reproduction. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 infection and vaccination on menstrual regularity in Saudi women of childbearing age. Additionally, it sought to explore the potential effects of COVID-19 vaccination on serum hormonal levels during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, along with their relationship with Vit.D. This case‒control study investigated the impact of COVID-19 infection and vaccination on menstrual regularity and hormonal function in Saudi women of reproductive age. Data were collected from 79 women who attended the Outpatient Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King Faisal Medical Complex in Taif, Saudi Arabia. All participants had received COVID-19 vaccines. The data collection process was comprehensive, encompassing various participant characteristics, such as demographic information, history of COVID-19 infection, and details about menstrual patterns before and after infection and vaccination. Furthermore, hormonal measurements, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), oestradiol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and vitamin D (Vit.D) levels, were extracted from the participants' medical records. Among the participants, 39.24 % had a history of COVID-19 infection, and following the infection, there was a significant increase in the proportion of women experiencing irregular menstruation. After receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, 72.15 % of the participants continued to have irregular menstrual cycles. The study found that a considerable number of participants had menstrual cycles outside the normal range, with 43.80 % having cycles shorter than 21 days and 35.10 % having cycles longer than 35 days. Comparing participants with regular and irregular cycles after COVID-19 vaccination, no significant changes were observed in most hormonal levels. However, the prolactin hormone showed a significant increase in participants with irregular cycles, while Vit.D levels were significantly decreased in this group. The study findings indicate a higher prevalence of irregular menstruation among participants, particularly after vaccination. Notably, irregular menstrual cycles were found to be associated with elevated levels of prolactin hormone and decreased levels of Vit.D.",['Alsaeedi FA; Gharib AF; Hassan AF; Alrehaili AA; Megli Althubiti R; Alharthi FM; Suleiman Alotaibi S; Mohammed Al Thomali A; Bakhuraysah MM; Alsalmi O; Ismail A'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38058640,the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on women's health. the menstrual cycle serves as a crucial indicator of fertility and reproduction.
Menstrual Cycle Disturbances after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Following COVID-19 vaccination, some women suffered from menstrual cycle disturbances. This study aimed to investigate menstrual cycle disturbances after COVID-19 vaccination in women of reproductive age. This cross-sectional study was performed on 407 vaccinated women in the vaccination center of Imam Hossein Hospital (Tehran, Iran) between October 2021 and October 2022. They were interviewed based on a research-made checklist which consisted of two areas of questions about the baseline characteristics of participants and menstrual cycle characteristics to explore menstrual characteristics following COVID-19 vaccination. The prevalence of menstrual disturbances was higher after the third dose (38.3%) compared with the second (27.9%) and first (17.7%) doses (P<0.001). After the first dose, a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome [PCOS, odds ratio (OR)=7.35, 95% confidential interval (CI)= (3.64-14.82), P<0.001] and menstrual disturbances with unknown etiology [OR=15.23, 95% CI=(6.30-36.80), P<0.001] could predict menstrual disturbances. After the second dose, a history of menstrual disturbances with unknown etiology [OR=3.83, 95% CI=(1.47-9.94), P=0.006] and menstrual disturbances after the first dose [OR=201.96, 95% CI= (40.99-994.90), P<0.001] were predictors of menstrual disturbances. After the third dose, a history of menstrual disturbances with unknown etiology [OR=3.09, 95% CI= (1.00-9.52), P=0.048], menstrual disturbances after the first [OR=9.82, 95% CI=(1.38-69.69), P=0.022] and second [OR=7.83, 95% CI=(1.46-41.92), P=0.016] doses could predict menstrual disturbances. We detected that many women experienced various menstrual disturbances after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Furthermore, a history of menstrual abnormalities (before COVID-19 vaccination and following the previous doses of these vaccines) was associated with developing menstrual disturbances.",['Rahimi Mansour F; Keyvanfar A; Najafiarab H; Hooshmand Chayijan S; Farzaneh F; Mortezaei G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38973271,cross-sectional study was performed on 407 vaccinated women. prevalence of menstrual disturbances was higher after third dose.
Neocortical long-range inhibition promotes cortical synchrony and sleep.,"Behavioral states such as sleep and wake are highly correlated with specific patterns of rhythmic activity in the cortex. During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the <i>in vivo</i> circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.",['Ratliff JM; Terral G; Lutzu S; Heiss J; Mota J; Stith B; Lechuga AV; Ramakrishnan C; Fenno LE; Daigle T; Deisseroth K; Zeng H; Ngai J; Tasic B; Sjulson L; Rudolph S; Kilduff TS; Batista-Brito R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38948753,neocortical long-range inhibition promotes cortical synchrony and sleep. behavioural states such as sleep and wake are highly correlated with specific patterns of rhythmic activity in the cortex.
Neodymium Laser Treatment for Overactive Bladder and Vulvodynia in Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome Patient: A Case Report.,"The Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a condition that affects a small proportion of female individuals at birth, resulting in the absence or underdevelopment of reproductive organs. However, this case report introduces overactive bladder (OAB) and vulvodynia, conditions that have not been previously reported in MRKH patients. The 36-year-old patient began developing breast tissue around the age of 12 but never experienced menstruation. Simultaneously, she started experiencing discomfort in the genital region and frequent urination. These symptoms gradually worsened, making it difficult for her to continue her education, and initially, she was misdiagnosed with a developmental disorder. Typically, the general understanding of MRKH syndrome has focused on reproductive anomalies, but this case underscores its diversity. Diagnostic assessments, including ultrasound, MRI, and various tests, revealed that the patient's severe genital discomfort and urinary symptoms were improved through a specialized Neodymium YAG laser therapy named ""PIANO mode,"" resulting in significant symptom relief and improved quality of life. This report emphasizes the importance of comprehensive and individualized approaches to managing MRKH syndrome. It aims to raise awareness that MRKH syndrome, while often associated with reproductive abnormalities, can also involve related symptoms like OAB and vulvodynia, which can significantly impact daily life.",['Okui N; Ikegami T; Erel CT'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283779,the mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome patient: a case report. the 36-year-old patient began developing breast tissue around the age of 12. she began developing breast tissue around the age of 12 but never experienced menstruation.
Experience of menstruation with the use of reusable menstrual products: a qualitative study among menstruators in Israel.,"Menstruation is an embodied experience that influences menstruators' perceptions of the self and body. The stigma surrounding menstruation and its negative representation in popular culture has consequences for women's sexual and reproductive health. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with forty 18-50 year old participants who used reusable menstrual products to examine their experience of menstruation and how their use of these products shaped their self-body image. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants commonly reported physical, medical and emotional improvement in menstrual experience and improved acceptance of the menstrual body alongside changes in feeling towards menstrual products and related issues. The participants described menstruation, menstrual blood, and the menstrual body more positively than before, reported a high comfort level with and in their bodies, and rejected common representations of menstruation. Findings suggest that using reusable menstrual products can contribute to body appreciation. Given these benefits, further research is needed to assess how knowledge of alternative menstrual products can stimulate positive views about the menstruating body and contribute to menstrual health.",['Kubovski A; Cohen Shabot S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37782548,menstruation is an embodied experience that influences menstruators' perceptions of the self and body. the stigma surrounding menstruation and its negative representation in popular culture has consequences for women's sexual and reproductive health.
"Health outcomes among former female collegiate gymnasts: the influence of sport specialization, concussion, and disordered eating.","<b>Objective</b>: Gymnastics is a popular sport with high injury rates, especially at the collegiate level. There is limited evidence, however, regarding the risks of early specialization in this sport, the rate of concussions in gymnasts, and the long-term effects of disordered eating in gymnasts. We sought to describe health-related outcomes of former collegiate gymnasts and the association with early sport specialization, concussion history, and disordered eating.<b>Methods</b>: We distributed an online survey through social media outlets. A total of 473 former female collegiate gymnasts completed the survey and were grouped according to early (<14 years) specialization, presence or absence of concussion history, and history of disordered eating. We determined the number of participants who had time-loss injuries, injuries requiring surgery, and injuries resulting in retirement. We also evaluated menstrual history, reasons for sport retirement, functional outcome measures, and mental health.<b>Results</b>: The median age of gymnastics specialization was 8 years [interquartile range = 6-11 years]. The proportion of injuries sustained during college did not significantly differ by specialization age. A significantly greater proportion of early specializers required surgery for college sports-related injuries (60% vs. 44%; p = 0.02). Forty-two percent of the respondents reported concussion history, and a greater proportion of those with concussion history reported seeking mental health treatment during college (32% vs. 23%; p = 0.03), and anxiety disorder diagnosis (16% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Disordered eating history was reported by 34% of the respondents, and this group had a higher proportion of time-loss injury (78% vs 65%; p = 0.004), and osteoporosis (4% vs 0%; p = 0.003) during college, and worse current pain (11.5 vs 10.2; p = 0.007) and physical function (12.2 vs 11.0; p = 0.01) than those without disordered eating.<b>Conclusion</b>: Athletes and clinicians should be aware of the long-term effects of early specialization, concussions, and disordered eating in gymnastics as these issues are common in female collegiate gymnasts.",['Sweeney E; Howell DR; Seehusen CN; Tilley D; Casey E'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33186080,"health outcomes among former female collegiate gymnasts: influence of sport specialization, concussion, and disordered eating. a total of 473 former female collegiate gymnasts completed the survey."
Circulating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Soluble fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1 as Biomarkers for Endometrial Remodeling Across the Menstrual Cycle.,"To characterize variation in circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1), across the menstrual cycle in normal ovulating women in relation to reproductive hormones to identify the utility of VEGF and sFLT-1 as peripheral biomarkers of endometrial remodeling. Ninety-six healthy, regularly menstruating ovulatory women, aged 18-44 years, enrolled in the BioCycle Study, a prospective cohort study at a U.S. academic research center. Vascular endothelial growth factor and sFLT-1 were measured in concurrently collected plasma, serum, and urine up to eight times across a single cycle. Reproductive hormones were measured in serum. Mean concentrations of VEGF and sFLT-1 were compared across phases of the cycle, and correlations between specimen types were calculated. Harmonic models estimated associations between VEGF and sFLT-1 and characteristics of hormonal patterns. No variation in VEGF or sFLT-1 levels were detected over the menstrual cycle. Median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) concentrations of VEGF during the menstrual cycle were 31.2 pg/mL (24.1, 56.9) in plasma, 194.1 pg/mL (125.4, 350.2) in serum, and 101.7 pg/mL (64.2, 165.8) in urine. Plasma and serum measures were consistently correlated, whereas urinary measures were not. Vascular endothelial growth factor was not consistently associated with reproductive hormone concentrations, although sFLT-1 was associated with higher mean and amplitude of estradiol. Circulating VEGF and sFLT-1 did not vary across the menstrual cycle and therefore are unlikely to be useful peripheral biomarkers of endometrial changes across the menstrual cycle. For studies measuring circulating VEGF for other reasons, plasma may be the preferred medium and timing to menstrual cycle phase need not be considered for reproductive-age women.",['Zolton JR; Sjaarda LA; Mumford SL; DeVilbiss EA; Kim K; Flannagan KS; Radoc JG; Perkins NJ; Silver RM; Wactawski-Wende J; Hill MJ; DeCherney AH; Schisterman EF'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278289,soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) were used as biomarkers for endometrial remodeling. soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 was used in menstrual cycles. sFLT-1 was used in ovulatory women in relation to reproductive hormones.
Association Between Particulate Matter Exposure and Preterm Birth in Women With Abnormal Preconception Thyrotropin Levels: Large Cohort Study.,"Prior research has linked exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) with preterm birth (PTB). However, the modulating effect of preconception thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels on the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and PTB has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether preconception TSH levels modulate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on PTB. This cohort study was conducted in Guangdong, China, as a part of the National Free Pre-Pregnancy Checkups Project. PM2.5 exposure was estimated by using the inverse distance weighting method. To investigate the moderating effects of TSH levels on trimester-specific PM2.5 exposure and PTB, we used the Cox proportional hazards model. Additionally, to identify the susceptible exposure windows for weekly specific PM2.5 exposure and PTB, we built distributed lag models incorporating Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 633,516 women who delivered between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, were included. In total, 34,081 (5.4%) of them had abnormal preconception TSH levels. During the entire pregnancy, each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was linked to elevated risks of PTB (hazard ratio [HR] 1.559, 95% CI 1.390-1.748), early PTB (HR 1.559, 95% CI 1.227-1.980), and late PTB (HR 1.571, 95% CI 1.379-1.791) among women with abnormal TSH levels. For women with normal preconception TSH levels, PM2.5 exposure during the entire pregnancy was positively associated with the risk of PTB (HR 1.345, 95% CI 1.307-1.385), early PTB (HR 1.203, 95% CI 1.126-1.285), and late PTB (HR 1.386, 95% CI 1.342-1432). The critical susceptible exposure windows were the 3rd-13th and 28th-35th gestational weeks for women with abnormal preconception TSH levels, compared to the 1st-13th and 21st-35th gestational weeks for those with normal preconception TSH levels. PM2.5 exposure was linked with a higher PTB risk, particularly in women with abnormal preconception TSH levels. PM2.5 exposure appears to have a greater effect on pregnant women who are in the early or late stages of pregnancy.",['Xu T; Ni H; Cai X; Dai T; Wang L; Xiao L; Zeng Q; Yu X; Han L; Guo P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39114947,"association between Particulate Matter Exposure and Preterm birth in women with abnormal preconception thyrotropin levels: large cohort study. prior research has linked exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 m (PM2.5) with preterm birth (PTB) however, the modulating effect of preconception TSH levels on the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and PTB has not been investigated."
"Epidemiological Characteristics and Spatiotemporal Patterns of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Xinjiang, China, during 2004-2021.","The spread of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a serious global zoonotic parasitic disease, is mostly under control; however, several cases have been reported in recent decades in Xinjiang, China. This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological status and spatiotemporal clustering characteristics of VL in Xinjiang, China, between 2004 and 2021 to provide a basis for the development and implementation of surveillance and response measures. Data on VL incidence during 2004-2021 were collected from the National Diseases Reporting Information System of China. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis, identification of local indicators of spatial association, and spatial-temporal clustering analysis were conducted to identify the distribution and high-risk areas. A total of 2034 VL cases were reported, with a mean annual incidence of 0.50 per 100,000. There was a general decreasing trend in the incidence of VL during our study period. The majority of the cases were reported from October to February of the following year, and fewer cases were reported from April to July. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that the incidence of VL was spatially clustered within a few counties. Significant differences were observed during the study period (Moran's I = 0.74, Z = 4.900, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio was 1.37:1, and most patients were in the age group 0-3 years. Cases were primarily distributed in seven regions and two autonomous prefectures, and Kashgar reported the highest number of cases (1688, 82.98%). Spatial analysis revealed that the aggregation of VL was predominantly observed in southwest Xinjiang. This was in alignment with the high-risk areas identified by spatiotemporal clustering analysis. The H-H clustering region was primarily observed in Gashi, Atushi, Shufu, Injisha, Kashgar, Yepuhu, and Bachu. These findings indicate that integrated control measures must be taken in different endemic areas to strengthen the VL control program in Xinjiang, China.",['Zhao J; Zhang Y; Zhang H; Wang S; He H; Shi G; Maimaitijiang W; Hou Y; Zhang L; Yin J; Wang Y; Cao J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39058195,"the spread of visceral leishmaniasis is mostly under control. however, several cases have been reported in recent decades in Xinjiang, china."
Footedness in merlins: Raptors perching in a cold climate.,"<b>ABSTRACT</b>Perching or standing on one foot is commonly reported in birds but the level of consistency in using one foot over the other has been less-well documented in most species, particularly birds of prey. For birds experiencing colder temperatures, unipedal perching has been attributed to limiting heat loss through unfeathered legs and feet; individuals should spend longer periods of time perched on one foot as temperatures decrease. Using radio tracking, I collected 486 hours of observations on nine overwintering, free-living merlins (<i>Falco columbarius</i>) in Saskatoon, Canada. Five merlins displayed clear preferences to perch on one foot, however the direction of preference was not consistent and four birds were ambidextrous. There was a curvilinear response in the proportion of time spent in unipedal posture versus temperature, with a peak of ∼22% of the time at moderate temperatures (-10 to -19°C), but lower values at warmer and colder temperatures; the main effect of the squared term for temperature was highly influential while individual foot preference had no impact on the use of unipedal perching. Although preferential use of one foot for perching was displayed by some individuals, thermoregulation may not be the primary driver of this behaviour at colder temperatures.",['Warkentin IG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38980996,merlins: Raptors perch in a cold climate have been compared to a foot. a higher level of consistency in using one foot over the other has been less-well documented in most species.
Uterine Uptake of Estrogen and Progestogen-Based Radiotracers in Rhesus Macaques with Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disorder of menstruating primates where tissues similar to the inner lining of the uterus exist ""ectopically"" outside of the uterus. The ectopic endometrium, like the endometrium within the uterus, expresses estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and undergoes hormone-dependent cell proliferation and bleeding each menstrual cycle. The goal of this study was to conduct abdominopelvic positron emission tomography (PET) scans with computed tomography (CT) imaging of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using radiotracers that target ER and PR [16α-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroestradiol (FES) and 12-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-furanyl-nor-progesterone (FFNP)] in individuals with and without endometriosis. We also aimed to determine if menstrual cycle phase and/or the presence of endometriosis affected the uptake of these radiotracers. Rhesus macaques with either clinically diagnosed endometriosis (n = 6) or no endometriosis (n = 4) underwent PET/CT scans with FES. A subset of the animals also underwent PET/CT scans with FFNP. Standard uptake values corrected for body weight (SUVs) were obtained for each radiotracer in target and background tissues (e.g., intestinal). We performed repeated measure analysis of variance tests to determine how uterine and background uptake differed with scan time, phase of the menstrual cycle, and disease state. Abdominopelvic PET/CT could not resolve small, individual endometriotic lesions. However, macaques with endometriosis displayed higher uterine uptake compared to those without the disorder. Radiotracer uptake differed by menstrual cycle phase with increased uterine uptake of both radiotracers in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Background intestinal uptake of FFNP increased over time after infusion, but only during the proliferative phase. PET/CT with FES and FFNP support the concept that ER and PR levels are altered in individuals with endometriosis. This highlights the impact of the disease on typical reproductive tract function and may provide a novel pathway for the identification of individuals with endometriosis.",['Wilson RC; Link JM; Lee YZ; Oldan JD; Young SL; Slayden OD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38133866,endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disorder of menstruating primates. the ectopic endometrium expresses estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and undergoes hormone-dependent cell proliferation and bleeding each menstrual cycle.
Menstrual hygiene management in public high schools in Ghana.,"in the ten (10) regions of Ghana. The findings showed that most girls in Public Senior High Schools in Ghana had prior knowledge about menstruation from their mothers and sisters prior to menarche. It was revealed that majority of the girls mentioned hormones as the cause of menstruation, whilst others mentioned the uterus, bladder, vagina, and other parts of the female reproductive system. A few of them had no idea what causes menstruation. The findings again revealed that most girls use sanitary pads, while some use other materials during menstruation. Less than half of the sample of girls in this study were able to change their pads twice daily or more. About half of the girls cleansed their genital parts only when bathing during menstruation using soup and water mostly. Half of the schools used pblic tap/standpipe as their main source of water and the rest used other sources of water. Also, most schools have toilet facilities.

"""Menstruation is a Fearful Thing"": A Qualitative Exploration of Menstrual Experiences and Sources of Information About Menstruation Among Adolescent Schoolgirls.","Although menstruation is a biological phenomenon, it is still subjected to secrecy, shame, and negativity. Schoolgirls lack access to appropriate sources of information about menstruation. Little is known about the content of the information provided to schoolgirls concerning menstruation in northern Ethiopia. This study explored schoolgirls' experiences and the content of information they receive concerning menstrual hygiene management in Tigray. A qualitative design was implemented. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted using the local language among 79 schoolgirls who had experienced menarche. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and imported into ATLAS.ti-7.5.18 computer software for analysis. Data were coded and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Five themes have emerged from the analysis: 1) there is an indistinct and haphazard source of menstrual information; 2) menstruation is perceived as ""a natural gift""; 3) menstruation is also considered fearful and embarrassing; 4) negative community perceptions of menstruation lead to menstrual restrictions, and 5) lack of privacy for dealing with menstrual issues as well as the scarcity of menstrual hygiene management materials is an on going problem. Schoolgirls have indistinct and haphazard sources of information concerning menstrual hygiene management, obtaining it from teachers, mothers, sisters, and friends, but the information they receive is shrouded in secrecy and often is factually incorrect. Menstruation is commonly linked to notions of sexuality, shame, and the approach of marriageability. The information that schoolgirls in rural Tigray receive about menstrual hygiene management is inaccurate, insufficient, and encumbered with social taboos. Thus, schoolgirls do not have an adequate understanding of the physiology of menstruation and do not receive adequate emotional support at menarche, leaving them with feelings of embarrassment and anxiety. There should be efforts to implement programs that change community perceptions about menstruation.",['Betsu BD; Medhanyie AA; Gebrehiwet TG; Wall LL'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37283993,"schoolgirls lack access to appropriate sources of information about menstruation. menstruation is a biological phenomenon, but is still subjected to secrecy, shame, and negativity. study explored schoolgirls' experiences and the content of information they receive."
Prescribed-time command filtered control for a class uncertain nonlinear systems.,"This article delves into the intricate challenge of implementing prescribed-time command filtered control in the context of uncertain nonlinear systems. Firstly, a prescribed-time function is defined to lay the groundwork for subsequent controller design. Subsequently, a novel prescribed-time command Filtered controller is proposed for high-order nonlinear systems featuring unknown parameters. This controller guarantees swift error convergence within a predefined time range, with the added capability of periodic error convergence to zero during subsequent controller operations. A pivotal innovation in this study lies in the controller's design, which remains unaffected by the system's initial conditions.

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Expression of Cation-Chloride Cotransporter (CCC) Genes in Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) across the Menstrual Cycle-A Preliminary Study.,"Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by debilitating affective symptomatology in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Based on the previous reports that PMDD may be related to GABAergic cellular dysfunction(s), we assessed whether cation-chloride cotransporter (CCC) gene expression across the menstrual cycle is altered in PMDD. As there are limitations in accessing the human CNS to study CCC-encoding genes, we utilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as an alternative model. We first sought to replicate previous reports characterizing CCC gene expression patterns in PBMCs of reproductive age women. We subsequently investigated potential distinct CCC mRNA expression patterns in women with PMDD. We collected blood samples across 8 menstrual cycle visits for PBMC separation/RNA extraction to study mRNA expression of four KCCs (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, KCC4) and two NKCCs (NKCC1, NKCC2) cotransporters. We mostly replicated the earlier gene expression pattern findings, and found that the expression levels of KCC1 were significantly downregulated during the mid-follicular and periovulatory subphases of the menstrual cycle in women with PMDD. The present study shows that PBMCs is a valid model for studying GABAergic mechanisms underlying PMDD.",['Cho S; Soumare F; Mumford SL; Rosas PC; Abrieva Z; Davis JM; Hamidovic A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38927257,premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by debilitating affective symptomatology in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. we assessed whether cation-chloride cotransporter (CCC) gene expression across the menstrual cycle is altered in PMDD.
Suspected Human-to-Cat Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in South Korea.,"This retrospective study reports the isolation and characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a household cat in South Korea. The cat, which was presented with respiratory symptoms, was identified during a retrospective analysis of samples collected between April 2021 and March 2022. Genomic sequencing revealed that the isolated virus belonged to the Omicron variant (BA.1), coinciding with its global emergence in early 2022. This case study provides evidence for the potential of direct human-to-cat transmission of the Omicron variant in South Korea during its period of widespread circulation. Our findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal populations to track viral evolution and potential spillover events.",['Yang JH; Oh Y; Moon SH; Lee GH; Kim JY; Shin YK; Tark D; Cho HS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066274,retrospective study reports isolation and characterization of a cat in south Korea. cat presented with respiratory symptoms was identified during a retrospective analysis.
Decreased NSD2 impairs stromal cell proliferation in human endometrium via reprogramming H3K36me2.,"The proliferation of the endometrium is regulated by histone methylation. This study shows that decreased NSD2 impairs proliferative-phase endometrial stromal cell proliferation in patients with recurrent implantation failure via epigenetic reprogramming of H3K36me2 methylation on the promoter region of MCM7. Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a formidable challenge in assisted reproductive technology because of its unclear molecular mechanism. Impaired human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) proliferation disrupts the rhythm of the menstrual cycle, resulting in devastating disorders between the embryo and the endometrium. The molecular function of histone methylation enzymes in modulating HESC proliferation remains largely uncharacterized. Herein, we found that the levels of histone methyltransferase nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (NSD2) and the dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 are decreased significantly in the proliferative-phase endometrium of patients with RIF. Knockdown of NSD2 in an HESC cell line markedly impaired cell proliferation and globally reduced H3K36me2 binding to chromatin, leading to altered expression of many genes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that cell cycle-related gene sets were downregulated in the endometrium of patients with RIF and in NSD2‑knockdown HESCs. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing and CUT&Tag sequencing analysis suggested that NSD2 knockdown reduced the binding of H3K36me2 to the promoter region of cell cycle marker gene MCM7 (encoding minichromosome maintenance complex component 7) and downregulated its expression. The interaction of H3K36me2 with the MCM7 promoter was verified using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative real-time PCR. Our results demonstrated a unifying epigenome-scale mechanism by which decreased NSD2 impairs endometrial stromal cell proliferation in the proliferative-phase endometrium of patients with RIF.",['Qin CM; Wei XW; Wu JY; Liu XQ; Lin Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38236723,decreased NSD2 impairs proliferative-phase endometrial stromal cell proliferation in patients with recurrent implantation failure. recurrent implantation failure is a formidable challenge in assisted reproductive technology because of its unclear molecular mechanism.
Physiological Factors of Female Runners With and Without Stress Fracture Histories: A Pilot Study.,"Female runners are at increased risk of stress fractures (SFs) compared with men. Literature is lacking with regard to best practice for preventing and treating SFs in women. The purpose of the study was to compare physiological measures and running-related factors between women of various ages and running abilities with and without a history of running-related SFs. Women with and without SF histories will differ with regard to medical and menstrual history, bone health, body composition, nutrition, and running history. Prospective cohort study. Level 2. A total of 20 female runners with SF histories were matched based on age and running distance with 20 women without SF histories. Data included medical, menstrual, running, injury, and nutritional histories; blood histology related to nutritional, hormonal, and bone-related risk factors; and bone density, fat, and lean tissue using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Paired <i>t</i> tests were used to examine differences between women with and without SF histories, and Spearmen correlations were conducted to examine relationships between physiological factors. Women with SF histories had lower hip bone mineral density compared with women without SF histories (<i>P</i> < 0.05). SF history was moderately correlated with menstrual changes during increased training times (<i>r</i> = 0.580; <i>P</i> < 0.0001) but was not correlated with any other physiological factor. There was a moderate correlation within the SF group (<i>r</i> = 0.65; <i>P</i> = 0.004) for bone markers for resorption and formation both increasing, indicating increased bone turnover. Female runners with low hip bone mineral density, menstrual changes during peak training, and elevated bone turnover markers may be at increased risk of SF. Female runners need routine screening for risks associated with SF occurrence. As bone mineral density and bone turnover markers are not routinely assessed in this population, important risk factors may be missed.",['Johnston TE; Dempsey C; Gilman F; Tomlinson R; Jacketti AK; Close J'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32525466,"women with and without SF histories differ with regard to medical and menstrual history, bone health, body composition, nutrition, and running history. women with and without SF histories had lower hip bone mineral density compared with women without SF histories."
Menstruation in the USA.,"Menstruation touches all spheres of human society, including psychology, education, business, policy, race, and religion. This narrative review aims to describe the relationship menstruation holds with these spaces. First, menstruation plays many roles in psychology - premenstrual syndrome affects psychological wellbeing and in turn, psychological stress impacts menstruation. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea can result when stress hormones inhibit the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Ovarian axis. Furthermore, menstruation has many implications for all aged individuals, especially adolescents and those who are menopausal. These implications underscore the importance of proper education surrounding menstruation, which can be achieved via social media, school systems, family, and clinicians. However, menstrual health education is highly variable depending on the state and family that someone is raised in. Additionally, menstruation can pose a financial burden as menstrual products can be expensive and access to these products is limited for those who are homeless, incarcerated, and low-income. Recent public policy measures in various states have aimed to achieve ""menstrual equity,"" by requiring public schools to supply free menstrual products in bathrooms. Furthermore, racial disparities exist with menstrual disorders. Uterine fibroids occur more frequently in Black menstruators compared to White menstruators, and Black women experience worse outcomes overall with fibroids and endometriosis management. Finally, analysis of religion and its relationship to menstruation underscores the immense stigma and ""impurity"" associated with menstruation. Overall, this review highlights the universality of menstruation in society. As a ""fifth vital sign"", there is significant room for improvement in terms of education, research, and cultural acceptance of menstruation. Future research should explore interventions to reduce these gaps.",['Ramaiyer M; Lulseged B; Michel R; Ali F; Liang J; Borahay MA'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38275000,"menstruation touches all spheres of human society, including psychology, education, business, policy, race, and religion. a narrative review aims to describe the relationship menstruation holds with these spaces. menstruation plays many roles in psychology."
Inositol treatment of anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomised trials.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of anovulation and infertility, and a risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome and endometrial cancer. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated the effects of inositol as an ovulation induction agent. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and ISI conference proceedings, Register and Meta-register for RCT and WHO trials' search portal. We included studies that compared inositol with placebo or other ovulation induction agents. Quality of studies was assessed for risk of bias. Results were pooled using random effects meta-analysis and findings were reported as relative risk or standardised mean differences. We included ten randomised trials. A total of 362 women were on inositol (257 on myo-inositol; 105 on di-chiro-inositol), 179 were on placebo and 60 were on metformin. Inositol was associated with significantly improved ovulation rate (RR 2.3; 95% CI 1.1-4.7; I<sup>2</sup> = 75%) and increased frequency of menstrual cycles (RR 6.8; 95% CI 2.8-16.6; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) compared with placebo. One study reported on clinical pregnancy rate with inositol compared with placebo (RR 3.3; 95% CI 0.4-27.1), and one study compared with metformin (RR 1.5; 95% CI 0.7-3.1). No studies evaluated live birth and miscarriage rates. Inositol appears to regulate menstrual cycles, improve ovulation and induce metabolic changes in polycystic ovary syndrome; however, evidence is lacking for pregnancy, miscarriage or live birth. A further, well-designed multicentre trial to address this issue to provide robust evidence of benefit is warranted.

"An examination of stress among Aboriginal women and men with diabetes in Manitoba, Canada.","In this study, a series of focus groups were conducted to gain an understanding of the nature of stress among Canadian Aboriginal women and men living with diabetes. Specifically, attention was given to the meanings Aboriginal peoples with diabetes attach to their lived experiences of stress, and the major sources or causes of stress in their lives. The key common themes identified are concerned not only with health-related issues (i.e. physical stress of managing diabetes, psychological stress of managing diabetes, fears about the future, suffering the complications of diabetes, and financial aspects of living with diabetes), but also with marginal economic conditions (e.g. poverty, unemployment); trauma and violence (e.g. abuse, murder, suicide, missing children, bereavement); and cultural, historical, and political aspects linked to the identity of being Aboriginal (e.g. 'deep-rooted racism', identity problems). These themes are, in fact, acknowledged not as mutually exclusive, but as intertwined. Furthermore, the findings suggest that it is important to give attention to diversity in the Aboriginal population. Specifically, Métis-specific stressors, as well as female-specific stressors, were identified. An understanding of stress experienced by Aboriginal women and men with diabetes has important implications for policy and programme planning to help eliminate or reduce at-risk stress factors, prevent stress-related illnesses, and enhance their health and life quality.","[""Iwasaki Y; Bartlett J; O'Neil J""]",2004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15223576,"focus groups were conducted to gain an understanding of stress among Aboriginal women and men with diabetes. focus groups were conducted to gain an understanding of the nature of stress among Aboriginal women and men with diabetes. key themes identified are not only health-related issues, but also with marginal economic conditions."
Improved ovarian adiponectin system expression in polycystic ovary syndrome treated with exenatide.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that can cause infertility. This experimental study was conducted to elucidate the role of adiponectin signaling in rats with PCOS treated with exenatide. Twenty-eight adult female Wistar rats were divided into four groups of seven. The normal group did not receive any drug. The PCOS+vehicle (Veh) group received estradiol valerate to induce PCOS, then was divided into PCOS +E50 and PCOS+E100 groups and treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg doses of exenatide, respectively. The mRNA expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptor 1 (Adipo-R1) was evaluated using a semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the level of adiponectin diminished in the PCOS rats while exenatide increased adiponectin expression at both doses. Adiponectin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the PCOS rats than in the normal rats (p<0.05). In addition, exenatide decreased the levels of Adipo-R1 expression. Taken together, our results showed that exenatide may improve PCOS characteristics in rats through the molecular regulation of adiponectin and its receptor.",['Vatankhah A; Jamhiri M; Vatankhah S; Lorian K; Rezvani ME; Izadi M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39084682,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that can cause infertility. this experimental study was conducted to elucidate the role of adiponectin signaling in rats with PCOS treated with exenatide.
"Perceptions and experiences of adolescents, parents and school administrators regarding adolescent-parent communication on sexual and reproductive health issues in urban and rural Uganda.","Evidence suggests that in spite of some adolescents being sexually active, many parents do not discuss sex-related issues with them due to lack of age-appropriate respectful vocabulary and skills. The likelihood of parent-adolescent communication improving sexual and reproductive health outcomes appears plausible. The desire to understand parent-adolescent communication and how to improve it for promotion of healthy sexual behaviours inspired this research. The paper is meant to describe perceptions of adolescents, parents and school administrators about parent-adolescent communication on sexual issues; describe the content of such communication and identify factors that influence this communication. The study was done among two urban and two rural secondary school students in their second year of education. Data were collected from 11 focus group discussions and 10 key Informants Interviews. Data management, analysis and interpretation followed thematic analysis principles. Illuminating verbatim quotations are used to illustrate findings. Parental warmth and acceptability of children was perceived by parents to be foundational for a healthy adolescent- parent communication. Perceptions of adolescents tended to point to more open and frequent communication with mothers than fathers and to cordial relationships with mothers. Fathers were perceived by adolescents to be strict, intimidating, unapproachable and unavailable. While adolescents tended to generally discuss sexual issues with mothers, male adolescents communicated less with anyone on sex, relationships and condoms. Much of the parent-adolescent communication was perceived to focus on sexually transmitted infections and body changes. Discussions of sex and dating with adolescents were perceived to be rare. Common triggers of sexuality discussions with female adolescents were; onset of menstruation and perceived abortion in the neighbourhood. Discussion with male adolescents, if it occurred was perceived to be triggered by parental suspicion of having female 'friends' or coming home late. Peers at school and mass media were perceived to the main source of sexuality information. Communication on sexuality issues between parents and their adolescent children was infrequent and critical elements like sex and specifics of protection against undesirable sexual behaviour consequences were avoided. Peers, schools and mass media should be creatively harnessed to improve parent-adolescent communication about sexuality issues.",['Muhwezi WW; Katahoire AR; Banura C; Mugooda H; Kwesiga D; Bastien S; Klepp KI'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621129,study was done among two urban and two rural secondary school students. study was done among two urban and two rural secondary school students. study was done in a second year of education.
"Navigating fear, shyness, and discomfort during menstruation in Cambodia.","While increased attention has been given to girls' menstrual hygiene management (MHM) experiences in schools as they relate to managerial challenges, research exploring girls' psychosocial experiences during menstruation and their needs in non-school environments remains limited. This study investigates the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding menstruation and MHM (M&MHM) among rural Cambodian girls (at least 14 years old, post-menarche; n = 130), mothers (n = 93), fathers (n = 15), teachers (n = 37; 54.1% female), and boys (at least 14 years old; n = 59) in both the home and school environments. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through structured interviews, focus groups, and latrine surveys in eight secondary schools and villages from two rural provinces, Banteay Meanchey and Kratie. Findings indicated that although 95% of girls felt capable of managing their menses each month, many girls experienced fear, shyness, and discomfort (FSD) during menstruation. Identified M&MHM challenges and FSD in both the home and school environments influenced all participant groups' decision-making, social interactions, and varied based on their knowledge of M&MHM and emphasized the need for comprehensive interventions that reduce the impact of MHM challenges on psychosocial experiences and FSD to promote girls' well-being during menstruation, particularly in income limited settings.",['Daniels G; MacLeod M; Cantwell RE; Keene D; Humprhies D'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36962410,"research explores the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding menstruation and MHM (M&MHM) among rural girls. 95% of girls felt capable of managing their menses each month. many girls experienced fear, shyness, and discomfort during menstruation."
Understanding the effects of the menstrual cycle on training and performance in elite athletes: A preliminary study.,"Success at an Olympic level can come down to the smallest of margins. However little research has been conducted into how the menstrual cycle affects elite athletes' performance and decision making. This study uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods to explore this question. Physiological performance data was collected from eight elite athletes for 7 months and analyzed as a function of menstrual phase. The Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) was used to test decision making and testing occurred twice in one cycle, during the early follicular phase and during the mid-luteal phase. Menstrual cycle phase was determined using menstrual cycle mapping and urine ovulation tests. In the qualitative part of this project, two elite athletes, two Olympic level athletes, and two coaches participated in semi-structured interviews. The study found that physiological performance was significantly better during the menses phase (MP) compared to the proliferative and secretory phases (PSP). There was variation in how elite athletes were individually affected however. Oral contraceptive users showed a greater performance change from MP to PSP suggesting that oral contraceptives may be detrimental to performance in some athletes. The results of the CGT showed that impulsivity is significantly affected by menstrual cycle phase. Risk taking, error rates and response times were not affected. The qualitative interviews revealed that elite athletes and their coaches understand little of the menstrual cycle. Despite this, there are preconceptions that it negatively effects performance during the menses phase. The findings suggest that the menstrual cycle can have a significant effect on an elite athlete's performance and this paper discusses how individuals can possibly improve aspects of physiological and psychological performance by understanding and monitoring their menstrual patterns.",['Statham G'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32771127,physiological performance data was collected from eight elite athletes for 7 months. results suggest that physiological performance was significantly better during the menses phase compared to the proliferative and secretory phases.
Dynamic light scattering unveils stochastic degradation in large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles.,"Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSNs) have been increasingly investigated as versatile drug delivery carriers. A particular challenge for the systemic use of MSNs lies in the control of their degradation, which has not been fully understood until now. We implemented standard dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments and introduced a novel DLS technique in a confocal volume to track the dynamics of large-pore MSN degradation in situ. This unique DLS technique, which involves a small observation volume, was chosen for its ability to count particle by particle during the degradation process, a method that has not been commonly used in nanoparticle research. The experiments were performed in different media compositions at low particle concentrations, below the silica solubility limit. MSNs with large conical pores were prepared and studied as they offer the possibility to incorporate and release large-sized biomolecules. Large-pore MSNs followed a singular degradation mechanism following a stochastic-like behavior, a finding that challenges the common idea that all nanoparticles (NPs) degrade similarly and homogeneously over time. We showed that some NPs are observed intact over a prolonged period while most other NPs have already vanished or been transformed into swollen NPs. Thus, a heterogeneous degradation process occurs, while the total concentration of NPs undergoes an exponential decay. These large conical pores MSNs will be utilized as reliable biomolecule nanocarriers by predicting the factors underlying the NP hydrolytic stability.",['Guerrero-Florez V; Barbara A; Kodjikian S; Oukacine F; Trens P; Cattoën X'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39079273,"dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed in different media compositions at low particle concentrations, below the silica solubility limit. the experiments were performed in different media compositions at low particle concentrations, below the silica solubility limit."
Hyperbaric Oxygen Post Established Stroke.,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been reported to improve neurological function in the chronic phase of stroke in a single trial having significant limitations, including a lack of a sham control. We conducted a single-center, parallel-group, randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of HBOT compared with a sham control in adults who were 6 to 36 months post-ischemic stroke. The treatment group received 40 sessions of HBOT at the Vancouver General Hospital Hyperbaric Unit. The control group received 40 sessions of sham treatment designed to replicate an HBOT experience. Due to recruitment challenges and timeline/feasibility tracking by the research team, the control arm was altered after 20 months to a waitlist in the hope of increasing participation. In the second phase, participants were randomized to receive HBOT immediately or following an eight-week observation period. The primary outcome was the post-treatment Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16). Secondary outcomes included the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Berg Balance Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, 5-Metre Walk Test, 6-Minute Walk Test, Grip Strength, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Box/Block Test, and Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression and Short Form-36. Based on detecting a clinically important between-group difference of 10 on the SIS-16 score, our target sample size was 68 participants per arm.  Results: From January 5, 2016 to October 9, 2018, 34 participants were enrolled in the trial, 27 during the first phase and seven in the second phase. The study was stopped after 36 months, and prior to meeting the sample size target, due to low recruitment. At the end of treatment, the difference in the SIS-16 between groups was 5<sup>.</sup>5 (95% CI: 1<sup>.</sup>3 to 9<sup>.</sup>7, p = 0<sup>.</sup>01) in favor of the sham group.

Adequate vitamin D supplementation does not ameliorate bone loss following long limb-biliopancreatic diversion in morbidly obese women.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of adequate vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) following long limb-biliopancreatic diversion (LL-BPD), a malabsorptive bariatric operation. Marked weight loss following bariatric surgery is associated with significant decrease in BMD, attributed to the weight loss and to nutritional, mineral, and vitamin D deficiencies resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism. Two groups, of 35 and 37 healthy, obese (BMI, 50.4 + 6.6 and 46.5 + 4.8 g/cm<sup>2</sup>), premenopausal, normally menstruating women underwent LL-BPD. Both groups received high-calcium diets, 600 IU of vitamin D, and 1000 mg elemental calcium daily, while group B received an extra dose of vitamin D (10,000 IU/day) during the first postoperative month, followed by dose adjustment in order to maintain 25OHD concentration higher than 30 μg/L. Areal BMD (aBMD) was measured at the lumbar spine preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. One year postoperatively, BMI decreased by approximately 19 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in both groups, while 25-OH-vitamin D levels did not change in group A (18.7 + 9.1 to 20.2 + 13.0 μg/L, (p = 0.57)) and increased in group B (15.58 ± 5.73 to 52.97 ± 15.46 μg/L, (p = < 0.001). PTH levels increased in group A (from 38.5 ± 12.2 to 51.2 ± 32.8 pg/ml) (p = 0.047) and decreased in group B (from 51.61 ± 18.7 to 45.1 ± 17.8 pg/ml) (p = 0.042). Lumbar spine aBMD decreased similarly in both groups (p = 0.311, for the comparison between groups) from 1.198 + 0.14 to 1.103 + 0.15 g/cm<sup>2</sup> in group A (p < 0.001) and from 1.157 + 0.14 to 1.076 + 0.14 g/cm<sup>2</sup> in group B (p < 0.001) and Z-score from 0.93 + 0.97 to 0.19 + 1.02, (p < 0.001) and from 1.15 + 1.29 to 0.419 + 1.28, (p < 0.001), respectively. LL-BPD leads to similar and significant bone mass reduction 1 year postoperatively, irrespective of adequate vitamin D replacement and in the absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism.",['Volonakis S; Koika V; Tzavelas G; Skopeliti M; Skroubis G; Kalfarentzos F; Alexandrides T'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33155141,LL-BPD is a malabsorptive bariatric operation. weight loss is associated with significant decrease in BMD.
Neonatal Encephalopathy is a Complex Phenotype Representing Reproductive and Pregnancy Exposome Effects on the Maternal-Placental-Fetal Triad.,"Reproductive, pregnancy, and placental exposomes influence the fetal neural exposome through toxic stressor interplay, impairing the maternal-placental-fetal (MPF) triad. Neonatal encephalopathy represents different clinical presentations based on complex time-dependent etiopathogenetic mechanisms including hypoxia-ischemia that challenge diagnosis and prognosis. Reproductive, pregnancy, and placental exposomes impair the fetal neural exposome through toxic stressor interplay within the MPF triad. Long intervals often separate disease onset from phenotype.

Unveiling the role of protein kinase A (PKA) activity in bovine oviductal epithelial cells: implications on apoptotic signaling pathways during the estrous cycle.,"The complex interactome crucial for successful pregnancy is constituted by the intricate network of endocrine and paracrine signaling pathways, involving gametes, embryos, and the female reproductive tract. Specifically, the oviduct exhibits distinct responses to gametes and early embryos during particular phases of the estrus cycle, a process tightly regulated by reproductive hormones. Moreover, these hormones play a pivotal role in orchestrating cyclical changes within oviductal epithelial cells. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying these dynamic changes, our study aimed to investigate the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) in oviductal epithelial cells throughout the estrus cycle and in advanced pregnancy, extending our studies to oviductal epithelial cell in primary culture. By a combination of 2D-gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry, we identified 17 proteins exhibiting differential phosphorylation status mediated by PKA. Among these proteins, we successfully validated the phosphorylation status of heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70), aconitase 2 (ACO2), and lamin B1 (LMNB1). Our findings unequivocally demonstrate the dynamic regulation of PKA throughout the estrus cycle in oviductal epithelial cells. Also, analysis by bioinformatics tools suggest its pivotal role in mediating cyclical changes possibly through modulation of apoptotic pathways. This research sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive processes, with implications for understanding fertility and reproductive health.",['Teijeiro JM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105776,oviductal epithelial cells exhibit distinct responses to gametes and early embryos during particular phases of the estrus cycle. oviducts exhibit distinct responses to gametes and early embryos during particular phases of the estrus cycle. this process tightly regulated by reproductive hormones.
"Tracking gonadal development in fish: An in vivo MRI study on polar cod, Boreogadus saida (Lepechin, 1774).","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to determine the sex of polar cod (Boreogadus saida Lepechin, 1774) (Actinopterygii: Gadidae) and to follow the gonadal development in individual animals over time. Individual unanaesthetised fish were transferred to a measurement chamber inside a preclinical 9.4 T MRI scanner and continuously perfused with aerated seawater. A screening procedure at an average of 3.5 h, consisting of a set of MRI scans of different orientations, was repeated every 4 weeks on the same set of reproducing B. saida (n = 10) with a body length of about 20 cm. Adapted multi-slice flow-compensated fast low-angle shot (FcFLASH) and rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) protocols with an in-plane resolution of 313 μm and an acquisition time of 2.5 min were used to visualise the morphology of various organs, including the gonads within the field of view (FOV). The MR images provided high resolution, enabling specific sex determination, calculation of gonad volumes, and determination of oocyte sizes. Gonad maturation was followed over 4 months from November 2021 until shortly before spawning in February 2022. The gonad volume increased by 2.3-25.5% for males and by 11.5-760.7% for females during the observation period. From October to February, the oocyte diameter increased from 427 μm (n = 1) to 1346 ± 27 μm (n = 4). Interestingly, individual oocytes showed changes in MR contrast over time that can be attributed to the morphological development of the oocytes. The results fit well with previous literature data from classical invasive studies.

Menopause Is Associated with Accelerated Lung Function Decline.,"Menopause is associated with changes in sex hormones, which affect immunity, inflammation, and osteoporosis and may impair lung function. Lung function decline has not previously been investigated in relation to menopause. To study whether lung function decline, assessed by FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>, is accelerated in women who undergo menopause. The population-based longitudinal European Community Respiratory Health Survey provided serum samples, spirometry, and questionnaire data about respiratory and reproductive health from three study waves (n = 1,438). We measured follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and added information on menstrual patterns to determine menopausal status using latent class analysis. Associations with lung function decline were investigated using linear mixed effects models, adjusting for age, height, weight, pack-years, current smoking, age at completed full-time education, spirometer, and including study center as random effect. Menopausal status was associated with accelerated lung function decline. The adjusted mean FVC decline was increased by -10.2 ml/yr (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.1 to -7.2) in transitional women and -12.5 ml/yr (95% CI, -16.2 to -8.9) in post-menopausal women, compared with women menstruating regularly. The adjusted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> decline increased by -3.8 ml/yr (95% CI, -6.3 to -2.9) in transitional women and -5.2 ml/yr (95% CI, -8.3 to -2.0) in post-menopausal women. Lung function declined more rapidly among transitional and post-menopausal women, in particular for FVC, beyond the expected age change. Clinicians should be aware that respiratory health often deteriorates during reproductive aging.",['Triebner K; Matulonga B; Johannessen A; Suske S; Benediktsdóttir B; Demoly P; Dharmage SC; Franklin KA; Garcia-Aymerich J; Gullón Blanco JA; Heinrich J; Holm M; Jarvis D; Jõgi R; Lindberg E; Moratalla Rovira JM; Muniozguren Agirre N; Pin I; Probst-Hensch N; Puggini L; Raherison C; Sánchez-Ramos JL; Schlünssen V; Sunyer J; Svanes C; Hustad S; Leynaert B; Gómez Real F'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27907454,menopause is associated with changes in sex hormones. menopause is associated with changes in sex hormones.
"Exploring seasonal variations, assembly dynamics, and relationships of bacterial communities in different habitats of marine ranching.","Offshore coastal marine ranching ecosystems provide habitat for diverse and active bacterial communities. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiple bioinformatics methods were applied to investigate assembly dynamics and relationships in different habitats. The higher number of edges in the water network, more balanced ratio of positive and negative links, and more keystone species included in the co-occurrence network of water. Stochastic processes dominated in shaping gut and sediment community assembly (R<sup>2</sup> < 0.5), while water bacterial community assembly were dominated by deterministic processes (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.5). Dissimilarity-overlap curve model indicated that the communities in different habitats have general dynamics and interspecific interaction (P < 0.001).

Short Term Effect of Corona Virus Diseases Vaccine on the Menstrual Cycles.,"The latest threat to world health is coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and the exact death rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still to be explored and varies widely throughout the world. Inactivated virus vaccines, recombinant viral vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and attenuated vaccinations have all been investigated in the hunt for an optimal SARS-CoV vaccine. Some women had menstrual abnormalities after immunisation, including heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), frequent bleeding (metrorrhagia/polymenorrhea), and postmenopausal haemorrhage. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia might be one of the underlying reasons. The aim to carry out this study was to survey by recruiting the female participants who were vaccinated with one or two shots of the available vaccine and observe short-term menstrual changes. This web-based survey cross-sectional study included women who were above 18 years, had the vaccine at least one month (one menstrual period) before participating in the study, had access to social media platforms and were willing to take part in the study. Women were excluded if, at the time of the study, they were pregnant or had amenorrhea of more than 6 months. Analysing the menstrual flow more, we saw that 24.5% of the patients had increased flow, while 15.5% had reduced flow which for both changes in the flow, the p-value was 0.017. However, 23.65 showed delayed periods, and 51.6% showed no changes. The changes in the timing were significant, indicating a p-value of 0.008. The study will be a significant contribution to the literature as this pandemic is new, and the vaccination against COVID-19 is still in the trial phase. We observed in our study that there was a change in the menstruation timings and flow after vaccination. However, further longitudinal studies are needed to conclude the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the menstruation cycle.",['M M Al-Mehaisen L; A Mahfouz I; Khamaiseh K; N Al-Beitawe S; Al-Kuran OAH'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36164386,coronavirus disease-2019 is the latest threat to world health. the exact death rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still to be explored. some women had menstrual abnormalities after immunisation.
"Prevalence of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding and Its Associated Factors Among Women Attending Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre In Northern Eastern, Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Women of reproductive age experience a lower quality of life and considerable morbidity as a result of heavy menstrual bleeding. This issue needs to be addressed to achieve gender equality and permit women and girls to engage in a range of economic activities. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and the most common factors associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Cross-sectional study was conducted at a zonal referral hospital in Northern Eastern, Tanzania. Data was extracted from women files who attended the hospital obstetrics and gynaecology clinic retrospectively. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. A univariate logistic regression model was fitted to assess the strength of the association between heavy menstrual bleeding and exposure variables. A total of 162 women aged 15-54 years were enrolled. The prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding was found to be 24.1%. The following factors were found to be significantly associated with heavy menstrual bleeding; age range of 20-44 years (OR: 0.16;95% CI: 0.02-1.01), hormonal contraceptives (OR: 3.16; 95% CI: 1.15-8.69), having no clots on menstrual blood (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.58-0.651), low haemoglobin level (OR: 5.61; 95% CI: 1.44-21.90), and uterine fibroid (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.73).

Field-of-view optimized and constrained undistorted single shot intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging of the cervix during the menstrual cycle: A prospective study.,"To provide insight into the biological characteristics of the healthy cervix by defining intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) parameters across the menstrual cycle. Forty-three females of reproductive age (18-45 years old) were included in this prospective study. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and IVIM-DWI scans were performed at multiple time-points across the menstrual cycle: T<sub>1</sub> (menses), T<sub>2</sub> (follicular phase), T<sub>3</sub> (luteal phase). Intra- and interobserver repeatability of the IVIM-DWI values were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and D* was excluded from the analyses due to poor repeatability. Differences in each IVIM-DWI parameter among T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> were explored. Subjects were stratified by age and parity for subgroup analyses (younger [18 - < 30 years] vs. older [≥30-45 years]; parity 0 vs. parity 1 and 2). Correlations between subject age and IVIM-DWI parameters were assessed. The overlap for each IVIM-DWI parameter among T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> was evaluated. ADC and D values of the cervix were significantly lower at T<sub>3</sub> compared with T<sub>1</sub> (p = 0.02 and 0.03) or T<sub>2</sub> (p < 0.01 and < 0.01). In younger subjects (n = 26), ADC and D values were significantly lower at T<sub>3</sub> compared with T<sub>1</sub> (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02) or T<sub>2</sub> (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04). In older subjects (n = 17), ADC values were significantly higher at T<sub>2</sub> compared with T<sub>1</sub> (p = 0.01) or T<sub>3</sub> (p = 0.01). There were significant differences in ADC values at T<sub>1</sub> in subgroup analyses stratified by age and parity (both p < 0.01). There was a moderate correlation between age and ADC values at T<sub>1</sub>. Overlap for IVIM-DWI parameters across the menstrual cycle was >50%.

Pharmacologic Treatments for PCOS Patients.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive-aged women and has a vast array of clinical manifestations. Common clinical presentations of the disorder include anovulatory infertility, menstrual disorders, cutaneous symptoms secondary to androgen excess, metabolic abnormalities and mental health issues. If the condition is left unaddressed or inadequately treated, long-term sequelae such as endometrial hyperplasia, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia may ensue, therefore it is imperative for clinicians to address each component of the syndrome. When initial lifestyle changes and dietary modifications do not suffice or fail, pharmacologic therapy should be considered, and when deemed appropriate treatment should be initiated.

"Prevalence, attitude and practice of self-medication among adolescents and the paradigm of dysmenorrhea self-care management in different countries.","Self-medication (SM) is an important worldwide public health issue affecting children and adolescents. The pattern of SM varies in different communities, affected by factors such as age, sex, income, expense, self-care orientation, educational level and medical knowledge. It is a fairly common practice: for minor health problems, it often provides cheap, rapid, and convenient solutions, outside of the health care system of many countries. Painkillers, antipyretics, cough medicines, cold preparations, dermatological products, nutritional supplements and antibiotics are the drugs most frequently used. Potential risks include incorrect self-diagnosis, improper dosage, inappropriate choice of therapy, masking of severe disease and drug interactions. Lack of awareness of warnings and precautions, storage conditions, the recommended shelf-life and adverse reactions increase the risk of side effects. Little is known about the SM of dysmenorrhea by adolescent girls. Attitudes towards treatment are influenced by cultural, ethnic, and religious factors. Some girls discuss dysmenorrhea with family and friends, and the majority may not seek medical advice. As dysmenorrhea is a common problem for adolescents, it is essential that these girls be aware of the normal and abnormal symptoms of menstruation. In the light of these findings, the roles of family, school, health professionals and health authorities are of utmost importance for the implementation of measures to approach this health problem in a more efficient way.",['De Sanctis V; Soliman AT; Daar S; Di Maio S; Elalaily R; Fiscina B; Kattamis C'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191679,dysmenorrhea is a common problem for adolescents. it is a common problem for adolescents. it is essential that girls be aware of normal and abnormal symptoms of menstruation.
"Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder's Impact on Quality of Life, and the Role of Physical Activity.","Most women who menstruate experience various physical, psychological, and behavioral changes during the period between ovulation and menstruation. This study focuses on defining and diagnosing premenstrual disorders, distinguishing between premenstrual symptoms (PS), PMS, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It highlights the prevalence of these conditions and their impact on women's quality of life, including social, occupational, and psychological aspects. Furthermore, the study examines the role of physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, in managing premenstrual symptoms. Several systematic reviews are cited, suggesting that regular physical activity can effectively reduce both physical and psychological symptoms associated with PMS. In conclusion, the management of PMS involves a multifaceted approach, with exercises, dietary modifications, stress management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medications all playing roles. Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, has been found to be an effective non-pharmacological therapy for alleviating PMS symptoms and improving overall well-being.

The Dose-Response in Elite Soccer: Preliminary Insights From Menstrual-Cycle Tracking During the FIFA Women's World Cup 2019.,"This preliminary study examined the influence of estimated menstrual-cycle (MC) phase on responses to soccer matches and training sessions in preparation for and during the FIFA (Fédération internationale de football association) Women's World Cup 2019. Twenty outfield players representing a national team were tracked over a 45-day period. External (10-Hz global positioning system; total and distance covered at high-metabolic power [≥20 W·kg-1]) and internal load measures (minutes ≥80% heart-rate maximum, sessional ratings of perceived exertion) were collected during all training and matches, with single-item wellness measures (fatigue, soreness, sleep quality, and sleep duration) collected each morning prior to activity. MC phase was estimated individually via an algorithm, informed from pretournament survey responses and ongoing symptom reporting (FitrWoman). Model comparison statistics were used to determine the impact of estimated MC phase in nonhormonal contraceptive users (n = 16). Sessional rating of perceived exertion responses to total distances ≥5 km were higher during the luteal phase (+0.6-1.0 au; P ≤ .0178) versus menstruation (phase 1), but no other observable dose-response trends were observed. Sleep, fatigue, and soreness ratings were not typically associated with MC phase, with the exception of exacerbated fatigue ratings in luteal versus follicular phase 48 hours postmatch (-0.73 au, P = .0275).

Ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block: a randomized comparison between parasagittal and transverse approach.,"Different approach ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block was used to aid awake intubation, but little is known which approach was superior. We aimed to compare the parasagittal and transverse approaches for ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block in adult patients undergoing awake intubation. Fifty patients with awake orotracheal intubation were randomized to receive either a parasagittal or transverse ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block. The primary outcome was patient's quality of airway anesthesia grade during insertion of the tube into the trachea. The patients' tube tolerance score after intubation, total procedure time, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, Ramsay sedation score at each time point, incidence of sore throat both 1 h and 24 h after extubation, and hoarseness before intubation, 1 h and 24 h after extubation were documented. Patients' quality of airway anesthesia was significantly better in the parasagittal group than in the transverse group (median grade[IQR], 0 [0-1] vs. 1 [0-1], P = 0.036). Patients in the parasagittal approach group had better tube tolerance scores (median score [IQR],1[1-1] vs. 1 [1-1.5], P = 0.042) and shorter total procedure time (median time [IQR], 113 s [98.5-125.5] vs. 188 s [149.5-260], P < 0.001) than those in the transverse approach group. The incidence of sore throat 24 h after extubation was lower in the parasagittal group (8% vs. 36%, P = 0.041). Hoarseness occurred in more than half of the patients in parasagittal group before intubation (72% vs. 40%, P = 0.023). Compared to the transverse approach, the ultrasound-guided parasagittal approach showed improved efficacy in terms of the quality of airway topical anesthesia and shorter total procedure time for superior laryngeal nerve block. This prospective, randomized controlled trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing First Hospital (KY20220425-014) and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (19/6/2022, ChiCTR2200061287) prior to patient enrollment.

A Systematic Review of the Psychosocial Impact of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Before and After Treatment.,"While polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age, the psychosocial impact of PCOS has not been evaluated across different quality of life (QoL) indicators. We rigorously analyzed available evidence pertaining to the psychosocial burden of PCOS in women of reproductive age and compared validated QoL scores of women with and without PCOS before and after treatment. We searched and considered publications from PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library that evaluated the association between diagnosed PCOS and QoL by standardized and validated questionnaires at baseline and after treatment. Reviewers assessed the risk of bias using established Cochrane and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale guidelines. A total of 33 studies were included in the review: 14 randomized controlled trials and 19 observational studies. The 36-Item Short Form Survey and World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF questionnaire both revealed that the diagnosis and life experience of PCOS had a disability score that was similar to or surpassed that of heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or breast cancer. QoL scores, associated with mental health issues, infertility, sexual dysfunction, obesity, menstrual disorder, and hirsutism, were lower at the baseline than after treatment in the majority of instruments measuring these variables in women with PCOS. PCOS is associated with significant psychosocial stress and reduced QoL across baseline measures and in comparison, to other diseases. Evidence suggests that treatment with therapy, medications, and lifestyle management decreased psychosocial burdens and alleviated QoL experienced by women with PCOS.",['Rempert AN; Sarria I; Standeven LR; Nylander E; Segars J; Singh B'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37341924,polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age. but the psychosocial impact of PCOS has not been evaluated across different quality of life indicators.
"The search for the relationship between female hormonal status, alpha oscillations, and aperiodic features of resting state EEG.","Fluctuations in sex steroid levels during the menstrual cycle and the use of hormonal contraceptives have been linked to changes in cognitive function and emotions in females. Such variations may be mediated by overall brain activity and excitability. We aimed to investigate the impact of female hormonal status on resting state EEG (rsEEG) parameters, including periodic (individual alpha frequency, alpha power) and aperiodic (1/f slope) features. rsEEG was recorded in healthy females (mean age 26.4 ± 4.6 years), who were naturally cycling in the early follicular (n = 33) or mid-luteal phases (n = 35), or who used either oral contraceptives (n = 35) or hormonal intrauterine devices (n = 28). Salivary concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were measured. Contrary to previous findings, this study did not reveal significant differences in rsEEG parameters between groups or significant relationships with hormonal levels. Age emerged as a covariate negatively related to the median 1/f slope.

Breaking the Cycle: Addressing Period Poverty as a Critical Public Health Challenge and Its Relation to Sustainable Development Goals.,"This narrative review comprehensively examines the intricate relationship between period poverty and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), positioning it as a critical public health challenge with far-reaching implications. Through an in-depth analysis of the multifaceted impact of period poverty on public health, including its effects on reproductive health, mental well-being, and economic participation, the paper underscores the urgent need to address this issue within the framework of the SDGs. An overview of existing literature on period poverty, its impact on health and well-being, and its relation to the SDGs was carried out. Different perspectives, interventions, and policy approaches to addressing period poverty were also explored. By illuminating the interplay between period poverty and various SDGs, particularly those related to gender equality, health, education, and economic empowerment, the study emphasizes the imperative of integrating menstrual health and hygiene into global development efforts. Advocating for targeted policies, funding, and advocacy, the manuscript calls for a holistic and inclusive approach to breaking the cycle of period poverty, ultimately contributing to advancing the SDGs and fostering a more equitable and healthier global society. Efforts to eradicate period poverty - providing affordable menstrual products, improving sanitation infrastructure, enhancing education, and implementing supportive policies - lead to significant progress in public health and gender equity. By prioritizing menstrual health management in public health policies, educational programs, and economic strategies, we can ensure that everyone who menstruates can do so with dignity and without limits on their potential.",['Mohd Tohit NF; Haque M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38887745,narrative review examines the intricate relationship between period poverty and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the paper highlights the urgent need to address this issue within the framework of the SDGs.
[Uterovaginal agenesis and polycystic ovary syndrome: psychological disturbance in adolescence].,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome (MRKHS) is characterized by complete or partial absence of the vagina, uterus and proximal fallopian tubes and diagnosis is usually made in late adolescence, when primary amenorrhea appears as the major symptom. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, includes a variety of clinical manifestations (menstrual irregularities, hirsuitism, acne, alopecia, obesity and infertility), due to androgen hypersecretion, insulin resistance and chronic anovulation. Both MRKHS and PCOS have been studied concerning the psychological aspects and have been associated with emotional distress as well as self-esteem, body image, identity and femininity impairment. The purpose of this study was to assess psychological functioning in adolescents with uterovaginal agenesis and primary amenorrhea due to MRKHS and those with hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea due to PCOS, compared with healthy adolescents. The participants were 70 adolescent girls, of whom 24 with MRKHS, 22 with PCOS and 24 healthy eumenorrheic adolescents (control group) matched by age and school grade. Psychological assessment included self report questionnaires, standardized in Greek population sample. Particularly, the ""Beck Depression Inventory"" (BDI), the ""State-Trait Anxiety Inventory"" (STAI-Gr) and the ""Youth Self Report"" (YSR) were used to measure depression, anxiety and psychopathology respectively, while the ""Symptom Checklist-90-R"" was used to measure psychopathology for the patients >18 years old. The results showed significantly higher scores on the state - anxiety scale for the MRKHS group compared with the control group. The MRKHS patients in late adolescence (18-20 years old) presented also significantly higher scores in depression and psychopathology scales (symptoms of anxiety, aggressive behavior and phobic disorder) than PCOS patients of the same age. On the contrary, regarding PCOS patients, age was negative correlated with attention problems and PCOS patients >18 reported significantly more somatic complaints compared with age-mate MRKHS patients and controls. PCO syndrome's clinical manifestations, including menstrual disorders, hirsuitism, acne, alopecia, obesity and infertility, may cause significant emotional distress. Nevertheless, they appear in great variety and our sample is characterized by mild features of hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea. This may explain findings of milder psychological disturbance associated with PCOS in this sample in comparison to other studies. As far as MRKHS is concerned, diagnosis and loss of reproductive ability, especially in late adolescence, obstruct emotional stability, physical maturity and sexual identity development ending that are expected in this period of life. Undoubtedly, the management of MRKHS in adolescence constitutes a complex multidisciplinary issue and psychological support of patients is needed in order to prevent possible psychological consequences and to achieve a normal transition to adulthood. Among the limitations of this study is the small sample size, which limits the generalisability of the reported results, especially in ""Youth Self Report"" and in ""Symptom Checklist-90-R"" questionnaires, where the sample was divided according to the age. Nevertheless, the very low incidence of MRKHS (1/5000) emphasize the value of the present results, which support the need for further investigation.",['Laggari V; Christogiorgos S; Deligeoroglou E; Tsiantis J; Creatsas G'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23073543,"polycystic ovary syndrome (MRKHS) is most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. diagnosis usually made in late adolescence, when primary amenorrhea appears as the major symptom.

The effect of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for cesarean scar pregnancy on ovarian reserve.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels after ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). A retrospective case series study was conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College. Thirty-two women with cesarean scar pregnancy who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study between January 2018 and December 2019. All patients underwent USgHIFU treatment with or without suction curettage. Intraoperative blood loss in suction curettage and hysteroscopy procedures, time to return of β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) to normal levels, and time to recovery of normal menstruation were recorded. AMH levels before and 3 months after HIFU treatment were compared to determine whether USgHIFU treatment affected ovarian reserve. AMH levels before and 3 months after HIFU ablation were 1.87 ± 1.19 ng/ml and 1.90 ± 1.17 ng/ml, respectively.

Ketonemia variability through menstrual cycle in patients undergoing classic ketogenic diet.,"Ketogenic dietary therapies (KDT) are well-established, safe, non-pharmacologic treatments used for children and adults with drug-resistant epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Ketone bodies (KBs) levels are recognized as helpful to check compliance to the KDT and to attempt titration of the diet according to the individualized needs. KBs might undergo inter-individual and intra-individual variability and can be affected by several factors. Possible variations in glycemia and ketone bodies blood levels according to the menstrual cycle have not been systematically assessed yet, but this time window deserves special attention because of hormonal and metabolic related changes. This study aims at searching for subtle changes in KBs blood level during menstrual cycle in female patients undergoing a stable ketogenic diet, by analyzing 3-months daily measurement of ketone bodies blood levels and glucose blood levels throughout the menstrual cycle. We report the preliminary results on six female patients affected by GLUT1DS or drug resistant epilepsy, undergoing a stable classic ketogenic diet. A significant increase in glucose blood levels during menstruation was found in the entire cohort. As far as the ketone bodies blood levels, an inversely proportional trend compared to glycemia was noted. Exploring whether ketonemia variations might occur according to the menstrual cycle is relevant to determine the feasibility of transient preventive diet adjustments to assure a continuative treatment efficacy and to enhance dietary behavior support. clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05234411.",['Pasca L; Ferraris C; Guglielmetti M; Varesio C; Totaro M; Trentani C; Marazzi C; Brambilla I; Ballante E; Armeno M; Valenzuela GR; Caraballo RH; Veggiotti P; Tagliabue A; De Giorgis V'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37575326,KBs may undergo inter-individual and intra-individual variability. glycemia and ketone bodies blood levels according to the menstrual cycle have not been systematically assessed yet.
Sex differences in prevalence of migraine trigger factors: A cross-sectional study.,"To examine the effect of sex on migraine trigger factors. Prevalence of 11 frequently reported trigger factors was determined in a cross-sectional study among migraine patients from a validated migraine database (n = 5725 females and n = 1061 males). Female-to-male odds ratios were calculated for each trigger, using a logistic regression model with attack frequency and migraine subtype (with or without aura) as covariates. Additionally, the effect of sex on total number of triggers per individual was determined. The top three most reported triggers in women were menstruation (78%), stress (77%), and bright light (69%). Men reported stress (69%), bright light (63%), and sleep deprivation (60%) most frequently as provoking factors. The following triggers were more often reported by women than men: Bright light (odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.12-1.48]; <i>p</i> = 0.003), stress (1.47 [1.27-1.69]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), skipping a meal (1.24 [1.09-1.42]; <i>p</i> = 0.015), sleep deprivation (1.37 [1.20-1.57]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), high altitudes (1.70 [1.40-2.09]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and weather changes (1.35 [1.18-1.55]; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Women reported more triggers than men, even when menstruation was disregarded (mean ± SD: 4.6 ± 2.3 and 4.3 ± 2.3; <i>p</i> < 0.001).<b>Conclusion:</b> Women report migraine trigger factors to be provocative of their attacks more frequently than men, which may be related to a lower migraine threshold due to sex hormonal changes.",['van Casteren DS; Verhagen IE; Onderwater GL; MaassenVanDenBrink A; Terwindt GM'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203218,"migraine patients were able to find a migraine trigger factor. menstruation, stress, and bright light were the most common triggers. men reported stress, bright light, and sleep deprivation most frequently."
Spatio-temporal changes of small protist and free-living bacterial communities in a temperate dimictic lake: insights from metabarcoding and machine learning.,"Microbial communities, which include prokaryotes and protists, play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and influence ecological processes. To understand these communities, metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to assess their taxonomic composition and track spatio-temporal dynamics in both marine and freshwater environments. While marine ecosystems have been extensively studied, there is a notable research gap in understanding eukaryotic microbial communities in temperate lakes. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the free-living bacteria and small protist communities in Lake Roś (Poland), a dimictic temperate lake. Metabarcoding analysis revealed that both the bacterial and protist communities exhibit distinct seasonal patterns that are not necessarily shaped by dominant taxa. Furthermore, machine learning and statistical methods identified crucial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) specific to each season. In addition, we identified a distinct community in the anoxic hypolimnion. We have also shown that the key factors shaping the composition of analysed community are temperature, oxygen, and silicon concentration. Understanding these community structures and the underlying factors is important in the context of climate change potentially impacting mixing patterns and leading to prolonged stratification.",['Karlicki M; Bednarska A; Hałakuc P; Maciszewski K; Karnkowska A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039016,metabarcoding analyses bacterial and free-living communities in temperate lakes. bacterial communities play an important role in aquatic ecosystems.
"""Tomorrow, I'll Be Fine"": Impacts and coping mechanisms in adolescents and young adults with primary dysmenorrhoea.","To understand the experiences of adolescents and young adults with primary dysmenorrhoea through the lens of structured frameworks extant in contemporary pain literature. Descriptive qualitative study. Thirty-nine adolescents and young adults (ages 16-24 years) with primary dysmenorrhoea participated in semi-structured in-person interviews. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed using deductive thematic analysis from November 2018 to April 2019. Two overarching themes, each with subthemes, were identified. The first theme, primary dysmenorrhoea impacts the whole person, contained the following subthemes: biological, social, and psychological. The second theme, coping mechanisms of women with primary dysmenorrhoea, contained the following subthemes: primary, secondary, and passive coping. Women experience several primary dysmenorrhoea-related impacts on their biological, social, and psychological functioning. Women employ a variety of coping mechanisms to manage their primary dysmenorrhoea pain. This study emphasizes the significant effects of primary dysmenorrhoea on nearly every aspect of women's lives and contributes to an understanding of the ways women cope with this pain.

Breaking barriers: Exploring female-specific health challenges affecting performance in an elite multisport training environment.,"Female-specific issues, such as breast injuries, pelvic floor dysfunctions, saddle sores, and menstrual symptoms, can significantly impact female athletes. This study examined the prevalence, perceived impact on performance, and role of the support staff in addressing and managing these issues in elite athletes based at a multisport training centre. Anonymous online questionnaire. A total of 180 female athletes from various sport disciplines at the Dutch Olympic Training Centre were invited to participate in the study. An anonymous, 39-item questionnaire was developed and hosted on Qualtrics collecting data on respondents' characteristics, breast injuries, pelvic floor dysfunctions, saddle sores, menstrual symptoms, contraceptive use, and communication about these issues. A total of 105 valid responses were analysed. The findings revealed that athletes regularly experience breast injuries (15.2 %), urinary incontinence (29.5 %), other pelvic floor problems (21.0 %), saddle sores (65.7 %), and menstrual cycle-related symptoms, with negative performance effects. Communication with support staff remained limited, with only 23.8 % of athletes discussing any of these issues, often due to concerns about understanding, shame, or a lack of opportunity for easy communication. The findings underscore the crucial role of creating a supportive environment, promoting early intervention, and utilising multisport centres to comprehensively address these concerns, emphasising the need for open communication, education, and support to enhance female athletes' performance and well-being.",['de Jager E; Willemsen M; Kempe M; Janssen I'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38734513,female-specific issues can significantly impact female athletes. 105 valid responses were analysed. a total of 180 female athletes from various sport disciplines were invited to participate.
Morbidities and medications used by practicing nurses during the climacteric.,"This study aimed to identify the morbidities and medications used by nurses practicing in São Paulo, Brazil, during the climacteric period to raise awareness and contribute to future preventive health measures in this population. A descriptive, cross-sectional study of 218 nurses aged 46-65 years based on data collected between January 2018 and July 2019 using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted. Respondents had a mean age of 53.9±5.1 years, mean weight of 71.3±13.6 kg, mean waist circumference of 91.6±14.5 cm, and mean body mass index of 27.8±4.9 kg/m2. Notably, 70.5% did not menstruate, had a mean age at last menstruation of 47.5±6.2 years and mean total score (Menopause Rating Scale) of 10.8±8.1, and reported the following morbidities: dyslipidemia (35.5%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (31.0%), rheumatologic diseases (14.8%), coronary heart disease (10.3%), diabetes (10.2%), malignant tumors (5.5%), deep venous thrombosis (3.2%), stroke (2.8%), and pulmonary embolism (0.5%). Medications used are antihypertensive agents (28.7%), antidyslipidemic agents (20.6%), antidiabetic agents (10.2%), antidepressants (9.6%), and anxiolytic agents (8.9%). The most prevalent climacteric symptoms were somatic and psychological, most notably physical and mental exhaustion and muscle and joint issues. The most common morbidities were anxiety, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, depression, arthrosis, arthritis and rheumatologic diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. The most frequently used medications were antihypertensive agents, antidyslipidemic agents (statins), antidiabetic agents, antidepressants, and calcium supplements.

"Burden of cervical cancer in India: estimates of years of life lost, years lived with disability and disability adjusted life years at national and subnational levels using the National Cancer Registry Programme data.","Cervical cancer is ranked as the second most common cancer in India. This study aims to assess the cervical cancer burden at the national and subnational level in India, projecting it for the year 2025 in terms of years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Twenty-eight population based cancer registries within the National Cancer Registry Programme network contributed cancer incidence and mortality data for this analysis. The DisMod-II tool, WHO lifetables, disability weights, mortality to incidence ratio, sample registration system, and census data were used to estimate the burden of cervical cancer. The projection estimates for 2025 were performed using a negative binomial regression model. In 2016, the cervical cancer burden in India was 223.8 DALYs per 100,000 women. The highest age-standardised DALYs were found in the northeast region (290.1 DALYs per 100,000 women) and the lowest in the eastern region (156.1 DALYs per 100,000 women). The states of Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Nagaland had a higher cervical cancer burden with DALYs exceeding 300 per 100,000 women. The projected cervical cancer burden for India in 2025 was estimated to be 1.5 million DALYs. The study has found a significant cervical cancer burden across the regions of India, providing a baseline for monitoring impact of actions. Enhancing awareness of cervical cancer, advocating for the significance of screening, and promoting HPV vaccination among adolescents, families, and communities through informative communication campaigns are essential steps in managing and ultimately eliminating cervical cancer in India.",['Ramamoorthy T; Kulothungan V; Sathishkumar K; Tomy N; Mohan R; Balan S; Mathur P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075548,cervical cancer burden in india is estimated to be 1.5 million DALYs. the burden is estimated to be a significant cervical cancer burden. the study aims to assess the cervical cancer burden in 2025.
"Effect of resveratrol on menstrual cyclicity, hyperandrogenism and metabolic profile in women with PCOS.","The aim of this randomized trial was to find whether resveratrol could improve menstrual dysfunction, clinical signs (i.e., acne and hair loss), and the biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism in the women with PCOS. Women, in the age range of 18-40 years, diagnosed with PCOS, as defined by the Rotterdam criteria, and no other known cause of abnormal menstruation, were recruited. Participants were randomized based on a 1:1 ratio, to either 1000 mg resveratrol or 1000 mg placebo daily groups, for a period of 3 months. Seventy-eight patients were randomized: 39 to the resveratrol group and 39 to placebo. Results were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. At the end of study, it was found that women who received resveratrol had a statistically higher regular menstruation rate, as compared to those who got placebo (76.47% vs. 51.61%; p = 0.03), and lower hair loss (32.10% vs. 68.00%; p = 0.009). We also found no significant differences between the two groups in terms of ovarian and adrenal androgens, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, free androgen index (FAI), glycoinsulinemic metabolism and lipid profile. Moreover, the resveratrol treatment did not interfere with the thyroid, liver and kidney functions. The negative effect of resveratrol on the body composition was also observed, though not influencing changes in the weight, relative to the placebo group. Resveratrol improved menstrual cyclicity and hair loss, even though levels of androgens, insulin and lipids remained unchanged.",['Mansour A; Samadi M; Sanginabadi M; Gerami H; Karimi S; Hosseini S; Shirzad N; Hekmatdoost A; Mahdavi-Gorabi A; Mohajeri-Tehrani MR; Qorbani M'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33610422,"resveratrol could improve menstrual dysfunction, clinical signs and metabolic profile in women with PCOS. women in the age range of 18-40 years diagnosed with PCOS were recruited. resveratrol was a randomized trial based on a 1:1 ratio."
Anomalous Interlayer Exciton Diffusion in WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> Moiré Heterostructure.,"Stacking van der Waals crystals allows for the on-demand creation of a periodic potential landscape to tailor the transport of quasiparticle excitations. We investigate the diffusion of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, or excitons, at the interface of WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> van der Waals heterostructure over a wide range of temperatures. We observe the appearance of distinct interlayer excitons for parallel and antiparallel stacking and track their diffusion through spatially and temporally resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy from 30 to 250 K. While the measured exciton diffusivity decreases with temperature, it surprisingly plateaus below 90 K. Our observations cannot be explained by classical models like hopping in the moiré potential. A combination of ab initio theory and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that low-energy phonons arising from the mismatched lattices of moiré heterostructures, also known as phasons, play a key role in describing and understanding this anomalous behavior of exciton diffusion. Our observations indicate that the moiré potential landscape is dynamic down to very low temperatures and that the phason modes can enable efficient transport of energy in the form of excitons.",['Rossi A; Zipfel J; Maity I; Lorenzon M; Dandu M; Barré E; Francaviglia L; Regan EC; Zhang Z; Nie JH; Barnard ES; Watanabe K; Taniguchi T; Rotenberg E; Wang F; Lischner J; Raja A; Weber-Bargioni A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38950893,Stacking van der Waals crystals allows for the on-demand creation of a periodic potential landscape to tailor the transport of quasiparticle excitations. we observe the appearance of distinct interlayer excitons for parallel and antiparallel stacking.
Measuring neuroplasticity in human development: the potential to inform the type and timing of mental health interventions.,"Neuroplasticity during sensitive periods, the molecular and cellular process of enduring neural change in response to external stimuli during windows of high environmental sensitivity, is crucial for adaptation to expected environments and has implications for psychiatry. Animal research has characterized the developmental sequence and neurobiological mechanisms that govern neuroplasticity, yet gaps in our ability to measure neuroplasticity in humans limit the clinical translation of these principles. Here, we present a roadmap for the development and validation of neuroimaging and electrophysiology measures that index neuroplasticity to begin to address these gaps. We argue that validation of measures to track neuroplasticity in humans will elucidate the etiology of mental illness and inform the type and timing of mental health interventions to optimize effectiveness. We outline criteria for evaluating putative neuroimaging measures of plasticity in humans including links to neurobiological mechanisms shown to govern plasticity in animal models, developmental change that reflects heightened early life plasticity, and prediction of neural and/or behavior change. These criteria are applied to three putative measures of neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (gamma oscillations, aperiodic exponent of power/frequency) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (amplitude of low frequency fluctuations). We discuss the use of these markers in psychiatry, envision future uses for clinical and developmental translation, and suggest steps to address the limitations of the current putative neuroimaging measures of plasticity. With additional work, we expect these markers will significantly impact mental health and be used to characterize mechanisms, devise new interventions, and optimize developmental trajectories to reduce psychopathology risk.",['Herzberg MP; Nielsen AN; Luby J; Sylvester CM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103496,neuroplasticity during sensitive periods is crucial for adaptation to expected environments. but gaps in our ability to measure neuroplasticity in humans limit clinical translation of these principles. we outline criteria for evaluating putative neuroimaging measures of plasticity in humans.
Effects of estrogen on spatial navigation and memory.,"Animal studies suggest that the so-called ""female"" hormone estrogen enhances spatial navigation and memory. This contradicts the observation that males generally out-perform females in spatial navigation and tasks involving spatial memory. A closer look at the vast number of studies actually reveals that performance differences are not so clear. To help clarify the unclear performance differences between men and women and the role of estrogen, we attempted to isolate organizational from activational effects of estrogen on spatial navigation and memory. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested the effects of orally administered estradiol valerate (E2V) in healthy, young women in their low-hormone menstrual cycle phase, compared to healthy, young men. Participants performed several first-person, environmentally rich, 3-D computer games inspired by spatial navigation and memory paradigms in animal research. We found navigation behavior suggesting that sex effects dominated any E2 effects with men performing better with allocentric strategies and women with egocentric strategies. Increased E2 levels did not lead to general improvements in spatial ability in either sex but to behavioral changes reflecting navigation flexibility. Estrogen-driven differences in spatial cognition might be better characterized on a spectrum of navigation flexibility rather than by categorical performance measures or skills.",['Joue G; Navarro-Schröder T; Achtzehn J; Moffat S; Hennies N; Fuß J; Döller C; Wolbers T; Sommer T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38407638,"estrogen enhances spatial navigation and memory. males generally out-perform females in spatial navigation. a double-blind, placebo-controlled study reveals performance differences."
"Within-host adaptive speciation of commensal yoyo clams leads to ecological exclusion, not co-existence.","Symbionts dominate planetary diversity and three primary symbiont diversification processes have been proposed: co-speciation with hosts, speciation by host-switching, and within-host speciation. The last mechanism is prevalent among members of an extraordinary marine symbiosis in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, composed of a host mantis shrimp, <i>Lysiosquilla scabricauda</i>, and seven host-specific commensal vasconielline ""yoyo"" clams (Galeommatoidea) that collectively occupy two distinct niches: burrow-wall-attached, and host-attached/ectocommensal. This within-host symbiont radiation provides a natural experiment to test how symbiont coexistence patterns are regulated in a common ancestral habitat. The competitive exclusion principle predicts that sister taxa produced by adaptive speciation (with distinct morphologies and within-burrow niches) are most likely to coexist whereas the neutral theory predicts no difference among adaptive and non-adaptive sister taxa co-occurrence. To test these predictions, we engaged in (1) field-censusing commensal species assemblages; (2) trophic niche analyses; (3) laboratory behavioral observations. Although predicted by both models, the field census found no mixed-niche commensal assemblages: multi-species burrows were exclusively composed of burrow-wall commensals. Their co-occurrence matched random assembly process expectations, but presence of the single ectocommensal species had a highly significant negative effect on recruitment of all burrow-wall commensal species (<i>P</i> < 0.001), including on its burrow-wall commensal sister species (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Our stable isotope data indicated that commensals are suspension feeders and that co-occurring burrow-wall commensals may exhibit trophic niche differentiation. The artificial burrow behavioral experiment yielded no evidence of spatial segregation among burrow-wall commensals, and it was terminated by a sudden breakdown of the host-commensal relationship resulting in a mass mortality of all commensals unattached to the host. This study system appears to contain two distinct, superimposed patterns of commensal distribution: (1) all burrow-wall commensal species; (2) the ectocommensal species. Burrow-wall commensals (the plesiomorphic condition) broadly adhere to neutral theory expectations of species assembly but the adaptive evolution of ectocommensalism has apparently led to ecological exclusion rather than coexistence, an inverse outcome of theoretical expectations. The ecological factors regulating the observed burrow-wall/ectocommensal exclusion are currently obscure but potentially include differential recruitment to host burrows and/or differential survival in ""mixed"" burrow assemblages, the latter potentially due to changes in host predatory behavior. Resampling host burrows during commensal recruitment peak periods and tracking burrow-wall commensal survival in host burrows with and without added ectocommensals could resolve this outstanding issue.",['Harrison TA; Goto R; Li J; Ó Foighil D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39119103,within-host adaptive speciation of commensal yoyo clams leads to ecological exclusion. symbionts dominate planetary diversity and are regulated in a common ancestral habitat. symbionts dominate planetary diversity and three primary symbiont diversification processes have been proposed.
Provider perspectives on adolescent access to contraception in South Africa.," Poor access to contraception influences adolescent health outcomes and may lead to sexual and reproductive health challenges. Unmet sexual and reproductive health should contribute to unplanned adolescent pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and other conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to enable adolescents to access appropriate contraceptive methods easily.  This study explored factors influencing adolescents' access to contraceptive methods from the perspective of primary healthcare providers in South Africa.  This study was conducted in two health districts of the Western Cape province in South Africa: the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality and the West Coast district.  Using a qualitative research design, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 healthcare providers who work in primary healthcare clinics. Subsequently, the interviews were transcribed and verified for errors. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis model guided the data analysis using ATLAS.ti software (version 22). The study adhered to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies checklist for qualitative research.  Four themes emerged through the data analysis: (1) personal influences, (2) community-level influences, (3) health system influences, and (4) policy-level influences. Representative quotations were used to illustrate the themes and sub-themes.  Adolescence is shaped by various influences that affect adolescents' ability to access contraception. These factors include their awareness of contraception, social environment, provider biases and school policies. Understanding these influences is crucial for addressing unintended pregnancies and promoting sexual and reproductive health among this age group.Contribution: This study highlights strategies that facilitate and hinder adolescents' access to contraception.",['Ketye TJ; Babatunde GB; Mianda S; Akintola O'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39099268,poor access to contraception influences adolescent health outcomes. unmet sexual and reproductive health should contribute to unplanned adolescent pregnancies.
Differentiating mortality risk of individual infants and children to improve survival: opportunity for impact.,"Children are not born equal in their likelihood of survival. The risk of mortality is highest during and shortly after birth. In the immediate postnatal period and beyond, perinatal events, nutrition, infections, family and environmental exposures, and health services largely determine the risk of death. We argue that current public health programmes do not fully acknowledge this spectrum of risk or respond accordingly. As a result, opportunities to improve the care, survival, and development of children in resource-poor settings are overlooked. Children at high risk of mortality are underidentified and commonly treated using guidelines that do not differentiate care according to the magnitude or drivers of those risks. Children at low risk of mortality are often provided with more intensive care than needed, disproportionately using limited health-care resources with minimal or no benefits. Declines in newborn, infant, and child mortality rates globally are slowing, and further reductions are likely to be incrementally more difficult to achieve once simple, high impact interventions have been universally implemented. Currently, 63 countries have rates of neonatal mortality that are off track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 2030 target of 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths or less, and 54 countries have rates of mortality in children younger than 5 years that are off track to meet the target of 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths or less. If these targets are to be met, a change of approach is needed to address infant and child mortality and for health-care systems to more efficiently address residual mortality.",['Berkley JA; Walson JL; Bahl R; Rollins N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068953,63 countries have rates of neonatal mortality that are off track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 2030 target of 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths or less. 54 countries have rates of mortality in children younger than 5 years that are off track to meet the target of 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths or less.
Oncological and Reproductive Outcomes of Fertility-sparing Surgery in Women with Early-stage Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"With delayed childbearing in women, preservation of fertility is an important issue for reproductive-age patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) can be considered in patients with early-stage disease in order to preserve fertility and improve quality of life. In order to evaluate oncological safety, attitudes toward childbearing and reproductive outcomes in women with EOC who underwent FSS, this multicenter retrospective study was conducted. Between January 2005 and December 2014, total of 87 young women with FIGO stage I EOC were included, with their clinicopathologic parameters in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) assessed. Attitudes toward childbearing, ovarian function and fertility were studied in women undergoing FSS (n=36). As a result, in contrast to radical surgery, FSS did not affect prognosis by Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank test; DFS: P=0.484; OS: P=0.125). However, two of the three recurrence cases and both death cases were in FSS group stage IC. All women undergoing FSS resumed regular menstrual periods after chemotherapy. Only 16 (44.44%) had tried to conceive, and 17 pregnancies occurred in 15 (93.75%) women. Among 20 women who did not attempt conception, the most common reason was not being married (70%), followed by already having children (15%). In summary, FSS is considered safe in young women with stage IA EOC. Regular menstruation and good obstetric outcomes can be achieved. This study also provides some insight into the attitudes and social factors regarding fertility in EOC patients.",['Chen J; Wang FF; Zhang Y; Yang B; Ai JH; Wang XY; Cheng XD; Li KZ'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32862386,87 young women with FIGO stage I EOC were included in the multicenter retrospective study. the study was conducted in a multicenter retrospective study. the study was conducted in a multicenter retrospective study.
The effectiveness of cervical mucus electrical impedance compared to basal body temperature to determine fertility window.,"Serial serum hormone measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are reliable measures to predict ovulation. These measures are inconvenient and expensive therefore, basal body temperature charting (BBT) and urine ovulation predictor kits (OPK) for luteinizing hormone are often used to determine the 6-day fertile window. However, BBT does not clearly change until 1-2 days after ovulation. Additionally, while OPK can indicate positivity prior to ovulation, false readings are common. A novel alternative approach involves measuring electrolyte trends in cervical mucus using electrical impedance spectroscopy. Cervical mucus electrolyte measurements are associated with hormone level changes during the menstrual cycle. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cervical mucus electrical impedance and basal body temperature. We sought to determine if cervical mucus electrolyte measurements provided improved detection of the ovulation day and therefore, improve fertility timing for women. 14 healthy women between 18 and 44 years of age with normal menstrual cycles were enrolled in the Observational Study. Participants measured BBT and cervical mucus electrical impedance daily for 3 menstrual cycles using Kegg (Lady Technologies Inc. San Francisco, California, USA). Ovulation date for each cycle was confirmed by measuring hormone levels in urine and serum, and by vaginal ultrasound. Electrical impedance was significantly different between the follicular phase versus ovulatory date (p = 0.007) and between the luteal phase versus the ovulatory date (p = 0.007). A significant difference in the rate of change of cervical impedance measurements in the pre-ovulatory follicular phase was found compared to BBT (p = 0.0225). The sensitivity (+ 7.14%), specificity (+ 20.35%), and accuracy (+ 17.59) to determine the 1-day fertility window was significantly higher using cervical mucus impedance compared to BBT. BBT is considered unreliable for evaluating ovulatory function. Cervical mucus electrical impedance offers a novel measure of electrolyte changes associated with hormone levels. We report that pre-ovulatory electrical impedance patterns demonstrated higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for determining the fertility window when compared to BBT. These findings suggest that changes in electrical impedance may provide an accurate method for predicting ovulation and for measuring ovulatory function.",['Tabbaa S; Hambright S; Sikes KJ; Levy G; Rydfors J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38705979,cervical mucus electrical impedance compared to basal body temperature. serenity hormone measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are reliable measures to predict ovulation.
Community pharmacists' views on providing a reproductive health service to women receiving opioid substitution treatment: A qualitative study using the TDF and COM-B.,"The absence of menstruation is common in women who use drugs. This can give a belief that conception is unlikely. When stabilised on Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST), fertility often returns, initially without realisation as ovulation precedes menstruation. This leaves women vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies. Community pharmacists (CPs) are frequently in contact with this patient group through the Supervised Consumption of OST service. This provides a timely opportunity to provide reproductive health (RH) advice. The aim of this study was to investigate pharmacists' views on providing a RH service to women receiving OST. Twenty semi-structured interviews based on the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation to Behaviour (COM-B) model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) were conducted between 2016 and 2017. Data analysis involved deductive coding using the TDF domains. The TDF domains were mapped onto the elements of the COM-B and used in the second step to create the framework and chart the data. The third step involved re-reading and clustering the codes, and inductive themes were generated to explain the data in depth. Nine of the 14 TDF domains, mapped into five elements of the COM-B, were identified. Five inductive themes were generated: 1) The pharmacists' experience and knowledge of reproductive health (RH) needs of women receiving OST, 2) The pharmacists' approach to providing advice, 3) The pharmacists' perception of the relationship with women receiving OST, 4) Social influences, and 5) Environmental factors. Community pharmacists feared causing offense to women receiving OST and described requiring cues as to when the service was needed. Pharmacists' highlighted a power imbalance in the relationship with women receiving OST. This could influence how receptive this patient group would be to pharmacy RH interventions. CPs' concerns of providing RH service could hinder a proactive service provision. Supporting good rapport and providing a structured consultation would increase the accessibility of such a service.",['Alhusein N; Scott J; Neale J; Chater A; Family H'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870263,the absence of menstruation is common in women who use drugs. this can give a belief conception is unlikely. pharmacists are frequently in contact with this patient group through the Supervised Consumption of OST service.
Molecular motor tug-of-war regulates elongasome cell wall synthesis dynamics in Bacillus subtilis.,"Most rod-shaped bacteria elongate by inserting new cell wall material into the inner surface of the cell sidewall. This is performed by class A penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and a highly conserved protein complex, the elongasome, which moves processively around the cell circumference and inserts long glycan strands that act as barrel-hoop-like reinforcing structures, thereby giving rise to a rod-shaped cell. However, it remains unclear how elongasome synthesis dynamics and termination events are regulated to determine the length of these critical cell-reinforcing structures. To address this, we developed a method to track individual elongasome complexes around the entire circumference of Bacillus subtilis cells for minutes-long periods using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We found that the B. subtilis elongasome is highly processive and that processive synthesis events are frequently terminated by rapid reversal or extended pauses. We found that cellular levels of RodA regulate elongasome processivity, reversal and pausing. Our single-molecule data, together with stochastic simulations, show that elongasome dynamics and processivity are regulated by molecular motor tug-of-war competition between several, likely two, oppositely oriented peptidoglycan synthesis complexes associated with the MreB filament. Altogether these results demonstrate that molecular motor tug-of-war is a key regulator of elongasome dynamics in B. subtilis, which likely also regulates the cell shape via modulation of elongasome processivity.",['Middlemiss S; Blandenet M; Roberts DM; McMahon A; Grimshaw J; Edwards JM; Sun Z; Whitley KD; Blu T; Strahl H; Holden S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38926336,"elongasome synthesis dynamics are regulated by molecular motor tug-of-war competition. most rod-shaped bacteria elongate by inserting new cell wall material into the inner surface of the cell sidewall. this is performed by class A penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and a highly conserved protein complex, the elongasome."
Overexpression of miR-200b-3p in Menstrual Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Endometriosis Women.,"The key relationship between Sampson's theory and the presence of mesenchymal stem cells in the menstrual flow (MenSCs), as well as the changes in post-transcriptional regulatory processes as actors in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis, are poorly understood. No study to date has investigated the imbalance of miRNAs in MenSCs related to the disease. Thus, through literature and in silico analyses, we selected four predicted miRNAs as regulators of EGR1, SNAI1, NR4A1, NR4A2, ID1, LAMC3, and FOSB involved in pathways of apoptosis, angiogenesis, response to steroid hormones, migration, differentiation, and cell proliferation. These genes are frequently overexpressed in the endometriosis condition in our group studies. They were the trigger for the miRNAs search. Therefore, a case-control study was conducted with MenSCs of women with and without endometriosis (ten samples per group). Crossing information obtained from the STRING, PubMed, miRPathDB, miRWalk, and DIANA TOOLS databases, we chose to explore the expression of miR-21-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-143-3p, and miR-200b-3p by RT-qPCR. We found an upregulation of the miR-200b-3p in endometriosis MenSCs (P = 0.0207), with a 7.93-fold change (ratio of geometric means) compared to control. Overexpression of miR-200b has been associated with increased cell proliferation, stemness, and accentuated mesenchymal-epithelial transition process in eutopic endometrium of endometriosis. We believe that dysregulated miR-200b-3p may establish primary changes in the MenSCs, thus favoring tissue implantation at the ectopic site.",['de Oliveira RZ; de Oliveira Buono F; Cressoni ACL; Penariol LBC; Padovan CC; Tozetti PA; Poli-Neto OB; Ferriani RA; Orellana MD; Rosa-E-Silva JC; Meola J'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35075610,no study has investigated the imbalance of miRNAs in MenSCs related to endometriosis. a case-control study was conducted with menSCs of women with and without endometriosis.
PGE2 and Thrombin Induce Myofibroblast Transdifferentiation via Activin A and CTGF in Endometrial Stromal Cells.,"Endometriosis is characterized by inflammation and fibrotic changes. Our previous study using a mouse model showed that proinflammatory factors present in peritoneal hemorrhage exacerbated inflammation in endometriosis-like grafts, at least in part through the activation of prostaglandin (PG) E2 receptor and protease-activated receptor (PAR). In addition, menstruation-related factors, PGE2 and thrombin (P/T), a PAR1 agonist induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of endometrial cells under hypoxia. However, the molecular mechanisms by which P/T induce development of endometriosis have not been fully characterized. To investigate the effects of P/T, RNA extracted from endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) treated with P/T were subjected to RNA sequence analysis, and identified activin A, FOS, and GATA2 as upregulated genes. Activin A increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and mesenchymal marker genes in ESCs. CTGF induced the expression of fibrosis marker type I collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), indicating fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT) of ESCs. In addition, activin A, FOS, GATA2, CTGF, and αSMA were localized in endometriosis lesions. Taken together, our data show that P/T induces changes resembling EMT and FMT in ectopic ESCs derived from retrograde menstruation, and that these are associated with fibrotic changes in the lesions. Pharmacological means that block P/T-induced activin A and CTGF signaling may be strategies to inhibit fibrosis in endometriotic lesions.",['Kusama K; Fukushima Y; Yoshida K; Azumi M; Yoshie M; Mizuno Y; Kajihara T; Tamura K'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34606582,Activin A and CTGF in endometrial stromal cells exacerbate inflammation. fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation is characterized by inflammation.
Variations of Ghrelin and Obestatin Hormones During the Menstrual Cycle of Women of Different BMIs.,"The cyclical changes of hormones during the menstrual cycle are responsible not only for reproductive function but also have other effects on dietary intake and appetite. The current study aimed to investigate the variations of appetite-related hormones (ghrelin and obestatin) during the menstrual cycle and their association with adipokines, estrogen, and BMI. Fifty-six regularly menstruating female students were grouped into normal weight (BMI ≤24.9; n = 26), and overweight/obese subjects (BMI ≥25; n = 30). Serum ghrelin, obestatin, leptin, adiponectin, and estrogen levels were measured during the early follicular, preovulatory, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle using the ELISA technique. There were insignificant differences in the levels of serum ghrelin, obestatin, and ghrelin/obestatin ratio across menstrual cycle phases in the whole cohort as well as in each group separately (p > 0.05). Serum ghrelin was significantly less in OW-OB as compared to the NW group (p = 0.005), whereas the average serum obestatin did not show any significant differences between the two groups. No significant correlation was seen between ghrelin and obestatin with the adipokines and estradiol. Significant low level of ghrelin was observed in obese group during the follicular phase. This finding may provide new insights into the altered ghrelin patterns in OW-OB individuals, as a cause or a consequence of obesity and related menstrual disorders.",['Salem AM; Latif R; Rafique N; Aldawlan MI; Almulla LB; Alghirash DY; Fallatah OA; Alotaibi FM; Aljabbari FH; Yar T'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791,ghrelin and obestatin hormones are responsible for reproductive function. cyclical changes of hormones during the menstrual cycle are responsible for dietary intake and appetite.
Reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception in Western countries: A systematic review.,"Over the past decade, women in Western countries have taken to various social media platforms to share their dissatisfactory experiences with hormonal contraception, which may be pills, patches, rings, injectables, implants or hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs). These online testimonials have been denounced as spreading ""hormonophobia"", i.e. an excessive fear of hormones based on irrational causes such as an overestimation of health risks associated with their use, that was already aroused by the recurring media controversies over hormonal contraception. In order to move toward a reproductive justice framework, we propose to study the arguments that women and men (as partners of female users) recently put forward against hormonal contraception to see whether they are related to hormonophobia. The aim of this article is to conduct a systematic review of the recent scientific literature in order to construct an evidence-based typology of reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception, in a continuum perspective from complaints to choosing not to use it, cited by women and men in Western countries in a recent time. The published literature was systematically searched using PubMed and the database from the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined). A total of 42 articles were included for full-text analysis. Eight main categories emerged as reasons for rejecting hormonal contraception: problems related to physical side effects; altered mental health; negative impact on sexuality; concerns about future fertility; invocation of nature; concerns about menstruation; fears and anxiety; and the delegitimization of the side effects of hormonal contraceptives. Thus, arguments against hormonal contraception appeared complex and multifactorial. Future research should examine the provider-patient relationship, the gender bias of hormonal contraception and demands for naturalness in order to understand how birth control could better meet the needs and expectations of women and men in Western countries today.",['Le Guen M; Schantz C; Régnier-Loilier A; de La Rochebrochard E'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34339927,"women in western countries have taken to various social media platforms to share their dissatisfactory experiences with hormonal contraception. these online testimonials have been denounced as spreading ""hormonophobia"" women and men have put forward against hormonal contraception to see whether they are related to hormonophobia."
Puberty health intervention to improve menstrual health and school attendance among adolescent girls in The Gambia: study methodology of a cluster-randomised controlled trial in rural Gambia (MEGAMBO TRIAL).,"Menstrual health (MH) is a recognised global public health challenge. Poor MH may lead to absence from school and work, and adverse health outcomes. However, reviews suggest a lack of rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of MH interventions on health and education outcomes. The objective of this paper is to describe the methods used in a cluster-randomised controlled trial to estimate the effect of a multi-component intervention to improve MH and school attendance in The Gambia. The design ensured half the schools (25) were randomised to receive the intervention which comprised of the following components: (i) Peer education camps and menstrual hygiene laboratories in schools, (ii) Mother's outreach sessions, (iii) Community meetings, and (iv) minor improvements of school Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities and maintenance. The intervention was run over a three-month period, and the evaluation was conducted at least three months after the last intervention activity was completed in the school or community. The other 25 schools acted as controls. Of these 25 control schools one Arabic school dropped out due to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of girls missing at least one day of school during their last period. Secondary outcomes included: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) symptoms, biochemical markers of UTI in urine, Reproductive Tract Infection symptoms, self-reported menstruation related wellbeing, social support and knowledge, perceptions and practices towards menstruation and MH in target school girls. In addition, a process evaluation using observations, routine monitoring data, survey data and interviews was undertaken to assess dose and reach (quantitative data) and assess acceptability, fidelity, context and possible mechanisms of impact (qualitative data). Cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention package will also be assessed. Results will add to scarce resources available on effectiveness of MH interventions on school attendance. A positive result may encourage policy makers to increase their commitment to improve operation and maintenance of school WASH facilities and include more information on menstruation into the curriculum and help in the reporting and management of infections related to adolescent menstruation.

Sex Differences in Energy Metabolism: A Female-Oriented Discussion.,"The purpose of this review is to delineate aspects of energy metabolism at rest and during exercise that may be subject to sex differences and the potential underlying mechanisms involved. It focuses on distinct aspects of female physiology with an oriented discussion following the reproductive life stages of healthy, eumenorrheic females, including premenopausal time frames, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause. Finally, this review aims to address methodological challenges surrounding sexual dimorphism in energy metabolism investigations and confounding factors in this field. During resting conditions, females tend to have higher rates of non-oxidative free fatty acid clearance, which could contribute to lower respiratory exchange ratio measures. At the same time, carbohydrate energy metabolism findings are mixed. In general, females favor lipid energy metabolism during moderate-intensity exercise, while men favor carbohydrate energy metabolism. Factors such as age, dietary intake, genetics, and methodological decisions confound study findings, including properly identifying and reporting the menstrual cycle phase when female subjects are eumenorrheic. Pregnancy presents a unique shift in physiological systems, including energy metabolism, which can be observed at rest and during exercise. Changes in body composition and hormonal levels during the post-menopausal period directly impact energy metabolism, specifically lipid metabolism. This change in physiological state factors into the evidence showing a reduction in our understanding of sex differences in lipid metabolism during exercise in older adults. This review reveals a need for a focused understanding of female energy metabolism that could help exercise and nutrition professionals optimize female health and performance across the lifespan.",['Sanchez BN; Volek JS; Kraemer WJ; Saenz C; Maresh CM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38888855,females tend to have higher rates of non-oxidative free fatty acid clearance. women favor lipid energy metabolism during moderate-intensity exercise. men favor carbohydrate energy metabolism.
Hypothyroidism in Context: Where We've Been and Where We're Going.,"Hypothyroidism affects up to 5% of the general population, with a further estimated 5% being undiagnosed. Over 99% of affected patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism. Worldwide, environmental iodine deficiency is the most common cause of all thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, but in areas of iodine sufficiency, Hashimoto's disease (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common cause of thyroid failure. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed biochemically, being overt primary hypothyroidism defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations above and thyroxine concentrations below the normal reference range. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are non-specific and include mild to moderate weight gain, fatigue, poor concentration, depression, and menstrual irregularities, while the consequences of untreated or under-treated hypothyroidism include cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. Levothyroxine has long been the main tool for treating hypothyroidism and is one of the world's most widely prescribed medicines. In adults with overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine is usually prescribed at a starting dose of 1.6 µg/kg/day, which is then titrated to achieve optimal TSH levels (0.4-4.0 mIU/L), according to the therapeutic target. We here summarise the history of levothyroxine and discuss future issues regarding the optimal treatment of hypothyroidism. Because nearly one-third of patients with treated hypothyroidism still exhibit symptoms, it is important that levothyroxine is used more appropriately to achieve maximum benefit for patients. In order to ensure this, further research should include more accurate assessments of the true prevalence of hypothyroidism in the community, optimisation of the levothyroxine substitution dose, proper duration of treatment, and identification of patients who may benefit from combination therapy with levothyroxine plus levotriiodothyronine.Funding: Merck.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.",['Chiovato L; Magri F; Carlé A'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31485975,over 99% of patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism. environmental iodine deficiency is the most common cause of thyroid disorders.
"Effects of Pubertal Timing and Pubertal Tempo on Social Physique Anxiety, Self-determined Motivation, and Exercise in Early Adolescent Girls.","Research has shown that there is a decrease in physical activity levels during early adolescence, especially for girls. Previous studies have shown that the social physique anxiety (SPA) may be a controlling factor influencing exercise motivation and engagement in this behavior; however, the potential role that puberty plays in this decrease has not been considered until now. The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of pubertal timing and pubertal tempo on SPA and exercise motivation and behavior. Data from 328 early adolescent girls, aged between 9 and 12 at the time of joining the study, were collected in 3 waves over a 2-year period. Using structural equation modeling techniques, different 3-time-point growth models were estimated to examine if earlier maturing and compressed maturing in girls had differential effects on SPA and exercise motivation and behavior. The results from growth analyses suggest that early maturing (according to all the pubertal indicators considered, except menstruation) tends to translate into (1) an increase in SPA levels and (2) a decrease in exercise - in the latter case, by reducing self-determined motivation. However, no differential effects from any of the pubertal indicators were found for compressed maturing in girls. These results highlight the need for increased efforts toward developing programs aimed at helping early maturing girls to cope with the challenges of puberty with a particular focus on SPA experiences and exercise motivation and behavior.",['Sicilia Á; Alcaraz-Ibáñez M; Paterna A; Gallardo LO; Martín-Albo J'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36934075,study shows that there is a decrease in physical activity levels during early adolescence. previous studies have shown that the social physique anxiety may be a controlling factor influencing exercise motivation and engagement in this behavior. but the potential role that puberty plays in this decrease has not been considered until now.
The impact of oncological package implementation on the treatment of rectal cancer in years 2013-2019 in Poland - multicenter study.,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; In 2015, in Poland, the oncological package (OP) was established. This law constituted a fast track of oncological diagnosis and treatment and obligatory multidisciplinary team meetings (MDT).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of OP on rectal cancer treatment.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The study was a multicenter, retrospective analysis of data collected from five centers. It included clinical data of patients operated on due to rectal cancer between 2013 and 2019. For most analyses, patients were categorized into three groups: 2013-2014 - before OP (A), 2015-2016 - early development of OP (B), 2017-2019 - further OP functioning (C).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 1418 patients were included. In all time intervals, the majority of operations performed were anterior resections. There was a significantly lower local tumor stage (T) observed in subsequent time intervals, while there were no significant differences for N and M. In period C, the median of resected nodes was significantly higher than in previous periods. Four of the centers showed an increasing tendency in the use of preoperative radiotherapy. The study indicated a significant increase in the use of short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and a decrease in the number of patients who did not receive any form of preoperative therapy in subsequent periods. In the group that should receive radiotherapy (T3/4 or N+ and M0), the use of SCRT was also significantly increasing.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; In the whole cohort, there was a significant increase in the use of preoperative radiotherapy and a decrease in the T stage, changing with the development of OP. Nevertheless, this relation is indirect and more data should be gathered for further conclusions.&lt;/br&gt.",['Krzeszowiak J; Pach R; Richter P; Lorenc Z; Rutkowski A; Ochwat K; Zegarski W; Frączek M; Szczepanik A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38940243,"study was a multicenter, retrospective analysis of data collected from five centers. it included clinical data of patients operated on due to rectal cancer between 2013 and 2019."
The Role of Organizational Factors in the Provision of Comprehensive Women's Health in the Veterans Health Administration.,"Increasing numbers of women veterans present an organizational challenge to a health care system that historically has served men. Women veterans require comprehensive women's health services traditionally not provided by the Veterans Health Administration. Examine the association of organizational factors and adoption of comprehensive women's health care. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2007 Veterans Health Administration National Survey of Women Veterans Health Programs and Practices. Dependent measures included a) model of women's health care: separate women's health clinic (WHC), designated women's health provider in primary care (DWHP), both (WHC+DWHP), or neither and b) the availability of five women's health services: cervical cancer screening and evaluation and management of vaginitis, menstrual disorders, contraception, and menopause. Exposure variables were organizational factors drawn from the Greenhalgh model of diffusion of innovations including measures of structure, absorptive capacity, and system readiness for innovation. The organizational factors of a gynecology clinic, an academic affiliation with a medical school, a women's health representative on one or more high-impact committees, and a greater caseload of women veterans were more common at sites with WHCs and WHC+DWHPs, compared with sites relying on general primary care with or without a DWHP. Academic affiliation and high-impact committee involvement remained significant in multivariable analysis. Sites with WHCs or WHC+DWHPs were more likely to offer all five women's health services. Facilities with greater apparent absorptive capacity (academic affiliation and women's health representation on high-impact committees) are more likely to adopt WHCs. Facilities with separate WHCs are more likely to deliver a package of women's health services, promoting comprehensive care for women veterans.",['Reddy SM; Rose DE; Burgess JF; Charns MP; Yano EM'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27745998,women veterans require comprehensive women's health services traditionally not provided by the Veterans Health Administration. a number of women veterans are more likely to be veterans.
The Antigen-Processing Pathway via Major Histocompatibility Complex I as a New Perspective in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a debilitating gynecological disease defined as the presence of endometrium-like epithelium and/or stroma outside the uterine cavity. The most commonly affected sites are the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, uterosacral ligaments, and the rectovaginal septum. The aberrant tissue responds to hormonal stimulation, undergoing cyclical growth and shedding similar to appropriately located endometrial tissue in the uterus. Common symptoms of endometriosis are painful periods and ovulation, severe pelvic cramping, heavy bleeding, pain during sex, urination and bowel pain, bleeding, and pain between periods. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Sampson's theory of retrograde menstruation is considered to be the most accepted. This theory assumes that endometriosis occurs due to the retrograde flow of endometrial cells through the fallopian tubes during menstruation. However, it has been shown that this process takes place in 90% of women, while endometriosis is diagnosed in only 10% of them. This means that there must be a mechanism that blocks the immune system from removing endometrial cells and interferes with its function, leading to implantation of the ectopic endometrium and the formation of lesions. In this review, we consider the contribution of components of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-I-mediated antigen-processing pathway, such as the ERAP, TAP, LMP, LNPEP, and tapasin, to the susceptibility, onset, and severity of endometriosis. These elements can induce significant changes in MHC-I-bound peptidomes that may influence the response of immune cells to ectopic endometrial cells.",['Nowak I; Bochen P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38478380,"endometriosis is a debilitating gynecological disease defined as the presence of endometrium-like epithelium and/or stroma outside the uterine cavity. the most commonly affected sites are the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, uterosacral ligaments, and the rectovaginal septum."
Narrative review of the prevalence and distribution of acute pain in children in the self-care setting.,"Acute pain among children is common, yet it may be underestimated and undertreated if the pain is not recognized. Assessing and managing pediatric pain can be complicated, and as such, measuring the prevalence of acute pain in children can be challenging. We sought to provide a consolidated review of the available data on the prevalence of commonly occurring acute pain in children in the self-care setting. An extensive literature search was performed to determine the prevalence of acute pain at multiple bodily locations in children aged between 3 months and 18 years. We considered the influence of age, sex, and sociodemographic factors on prevalence estimates. We also sought to identify some of the challenges involved in assessing and managing pediatric pain, thus shedding light on areas where there may be clinical and medical unmet needs. In general, a high prevalence of acute pain in children was detected, particularly headache, menstruation-related pain, and dental and back pain. Older age, female sex, and lower socioeconomic status were associated with increased pain prevalence. Risk factors were identified for all pain types and included psychological issues, stress, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. Owing to the heterogeneity in study populations, the prevalence estimates varied widely; there was also heterogeneity in the pain assessment tools utilized. The paucity of information regarding pain prevalence appears to be out of proportion with the burden of acute pain in children. This could indicate that clinicians may not be equipped with an optimal pain management strategy to guide their practice, especially regarding the use of developmentally appropriate pain assessment tools, without which prevalence data may not be captured. If acute pain is not accurately identified, it cannot be optimally treated. Further investigation is required to determine how the information from prevalence studies translates to the real-world setting.",['Shinde N; Kanabar DJ; Miles LJ'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36618510,a review of the prevalence of acute pain in children in the self-care setting. the prevalence of acute pain in children is common. the prevalence of acute pain in children is common.
Intrauterine contraceptives that do not fit well contribute to early discontinuation.,"To shed additional light on various aspects of intrauterine contraception discussed recently in a comprehensive review article and on the continued development of frameless copper intrauterine devices (IUDs). An essential feature of intrauterine contraceptives is their long duration of action. However, this only applies in the absence of side effects. The importance of dimensional compatibility of the IUD or intrauterine system (IUS) with the uterine cavity should be stressed: IUD/IUS designs that fit will lead to high acceptability, a prerequisite with regard to continuation of use. Dimensional incompatibility, on the other hand, is a cause of cramping pain, erratic bleeding or menorrhagia, dislocation or expulsion and, as a result thereof, pregnancy. The size of the intrauterine foreign body, in relation to that of the uterine cavity, determines its acceptability and influences menstrual bleeding. Abnormal and heavy menstrual bleeding is an issue which has not been fully resolved. It is the most common cause of discontinuation of this contraceptive modality. The size of the IUD can be reduced without jeopardizing its effectiveness provided the effective copper surface is sufficiently large. Properly designed and fitting IUDs and IUSs are associated with fewer side effects and greater user satisfaction. This, in turn, could increase usage of intrauterine contraception and thus reduce further the number of unintented pregnancies and induced abortions.",['Wildemeersch D'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21281098,"intrauterine contraceptives that do not fit well contribute to early discontinuation. dimensional compatibility of the IUD and intrauterine system (IUS) with the uterine cavity should be stressed. dimensions incompatibility is a cause of cramping pain, erratic bleeding or menorrhagia, dislocation or expulsion and, as a result thereof, pregnancy."
Insomnia Symptoms and Menstrual Health: Is There a Link in Women During Reproductive Phase of Life?,"To investigate the association between insomnia severity symptoms and menstrual health, fatigue and anxiety symptoms in women at reproductive age. We used data from EPISONO (2007), an epidemiological study from the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Women completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to obtain information about insomnia, fatigue, and anxiety symptoms. For menstrual health, we collected information using our Institutional Women's Questionnaire about menstrual flow and duration, the presence of pain during menstruation and menstrual cycle regularity. The statistical analysis was performed using ordinal logistic regression, considering <i>p</i> < .05. Of the 1,042 participants, only 282 women met the inclusion criteria to participate in this study. The mean age was 34.4 years (SD ± 8.36), and the body mass index (BMI) was 25.7 (SD ± 5.39). According to the model, a 1-unit higher CFS score increased the odds of having more insomnia symptoms in the ISI (OR = 1.170; 95% CI=[1.073; 1.279]; <i>p</i> < .001). In the same way, a 1-unit higher BAI score increased the chance of presenting insomnia symptoms, according to the ISI (OR = 1.072; 95% CI=[1.042; 1.104]; <i>p</i> < .001). The menstrual variables did not represent statistical significance in the model. Fatigue and anxiety symptoms were associated with insomnia symptoms; however, no association was observed between menstrual health and insomnia. The need to examine sleep when there are sleep complaints is essential to provide an accurate diagnosis that facilitates appropriate treatment and to provide better sleep quality for women.",['Ishikura IA; Porcacchia AS; Hachul H; Tufik S; Andersen ML'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38818889,"women completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to obtain information about insomnia, fatigue, and anxiety symptoms."
Self-Managed Abortion Attempts Before vs After Changes in Federal Abortion Protections in the US.,"With decreasing access to facility-based abortion in the US, an increase in self-managed abortion (SMA) using various methods is anticipated. To date, no studies have examined changes in SMA in the shifting policy landscape. To estimate changes in SMA prevalence among the general US population from before to after the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision overturning federal abortion protections. Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered throughout the US from December 10, 2021, to January 11, 2022, and June 14 to July 7, 2023. Participants included online panel members assigned female sex at birth, ages 18 to 49 years (or ages 15-17 years if a household member), who were English- or Spanish-speaking. Year of the survey (2021-2022 vs 2023). Participants were asked whether they had ""ever taken or done something on their own, without medical assistance, to try to end a pregnancy"" and, if so, details of their experience. Changes in the weighted SMA prevalence between survey years were examined, factors associated with SMA experience were identified, and projected lifetime SMA prevalence was calculated using discrete-time event history models, accounting for abortion underreporting. Median age of the participants was 32.5 (IQR, 25-41) years in 2021-2022 (n = 7016) and 32.0 (IQR, 24-40) in 2023 (n = 7148). Across both years, approximately 14% were non-Hispanic Black, 21% were Hispanic, and 54% were non-Hispanic White. The weighted adjusted proportion that ever attempted SMA was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.0%) in 2021-2022 and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.0%) in 2023-an increase of 1.0% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.7%; P = .03). Projected lifetime SMA prevalence accounting for abortion underreporting was 10.7% (95% CI, 8.6%-12.8%). In adjusted analyses, SMA experience was higher among non-Hispanic Black (4.3%; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.8%) vs other racial and ethnic (2.7%; 95% CI, 2.2%-3.1%) groups (P = .04) and sexual and gender minority (5.0%; 95% CI, 3.4%-6.6%) vs heterosexual or cisgender (2.5%; 95% CI, 2.0%-2.9%) participants (P < .001). Approximately 4 in 10 (45.3% in 2021 and 39.0% in 2023) SMA attempts occurred before age 20 years. The methods used included herbs (29.8% [2021-2022] vs 25.9% [2023]), physical methods (28.6% [2021-2022] vs 29.7% [2023]), or alcohol or other substances (17.9% [2021-2022] vs 18.6% [2023]). Few participants (7.1% [2021-2022] vs 4.7% [2023]) sought emergency care for a complication. In this serial nationally representative survey study, increased SMA was observed following the loss of federal abortion protections. The findings revealed increased SMA use among marginalized groups, most often with ineffective methods. These findings suggest the need to expand access to alternative models of safe and effective abortion care and ensure those seeking health care post-SMA do not face legal risks.",['Ralph L; Schroeder R; Kaller S; Grossman D; Biggs MA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39078630,"no studies have examined changes in SMA in shifting policy landscape. a survey was administered throughout the us from December 10, 2021, to January 11, 2022. participants included online panel members assigned female sex at birth."
Acceptability and safety of the menstrual cup: A systematic review of the literature.,"To conduct a systematic review of the literature and assess the acceptability and safety of the menstrual cup as a feminine hygiene product. A search was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, PopLine and Google Scholar databases for publications be- tween 1966 and July 2019. The terms (""Menstrual"" AND ""Cup"") OR (""Copa"" AND ""Menstrual"") were used. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed studies were included, as well as case series and case reports published in English and Spanish assessing the menstrual cup in women in childbearing age. The studies were selected and the data extracted by two reviewers working independently. Acceptability and safety were assessed as the primary result. The summary of the information is presented in narrative form. Overall, 737 titles were found for initial review and, in the end, 38 studies were included in this work. The acceptability of the menstrual cup ranges between 35 % and 90 %. Between 10 to 45 % of women found it difficult to use. It was described as more comfortable when compared to tampons and pads. Continued use of the cup ranges between 48 and 94 %. In terms of safety, there was one case of toxic shock syndrome, one case of mechanical entrapment, and another case of allergy; and a higher risk of expulsion was found among intrauterine device users. The menstrual cup appears to be a comfortable, safe and efficient option for menstrual hygiene. Further randomized controlled studies and long-term prospective cohort studies are needed in order to determine the risk of complications due to excess bacterial colonization or retrograde menstruation.",['Arenas-Gallo C; Ramírez-Rocha G; González-Hakspiel L; Merlano-Alcendra C; Palomino-Suárez D; Rueda-Espinel S'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770872,"systematic review of literature and assess the acceptability and safety of the menstrual cup. the terms ""Menstrual"" AND ""Cup"" OR ""Copa"" AND ""Menstrual"" were used."
Cardiovascular disease in women: contraceptive issues and nonvalvular cardiovascular disease.,"Several reproductive issues affect cardiovascular risk in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome is common and may include menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and metabolic symptoms. Patients with this syndrome have an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Hysterectomy is a common gynecologic surgery that may affect estrogen levels in women. There are conflicting data on the cardiovascular risk associated with estrogen use in women after a hysterectomy. Human papillomavirus is a newly identified risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanism and effect are still unknown. Contraceptives are the most commonly used prescription drugs among women in the United States. The absolute risk of CVD in young women is low; therefore, the threefold increase in risk that is associated with contraceptives is still low. Estrogen is thought to be the primary concern related to the increased cardiovascular risk associated with combined oral contraceptives. Contraceptive pills also may affect insulin, lipid, and blood pressure levels.",['Schrager S; Dalby J; Hayon R; Fox K'],2013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23977829,hysterectomy is a common gynecologic surgery that may affect estrogen levels in women. papillomavirus is a newly identified risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
Gynaecological and obstetric management of women with inherited bleeding disorders.,"The prevalence of bleeding disorders, notably von Willebrand disease (vWD), among adult women with objectively documented menorrhagia is consistently reported to be 10% to 20% and is even higher in adolescents presenting with menorrhagia. This consensus document has been developed by a multidisciplinary committee consisting of an anesthesiologist, 2 hematologists, and an obstetrician/gynaecologist and has been endorsed by their relevant specialty bodies. It has been prepared with the express purpose of providing guidelines for both women with inherited bleeding disorders and for their caregivers regarding the gynaecological and obstetric management of these women, including appropriate anesthesia support where indicated. Diagnostic tools and specific medical and, where appropriate, surgical alternatives to management are reviewed and evidence-based recommendations presented. A MEDLINE search of the English literature between January 1975 and November 2003 was performed using the following key words: menorrhagia, uterine bleeding, pregnancy, von Willebrand, congenital bleeding disorder, desmopressin/DDAVP, tranexamic acid, oral contraceptives, medroxyprogesterone, therapy, hysterectomy, anesthesia, epidural, spinal. Recommendations from other society guidelines were reviewed. 1. Inherited bleeding disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with menorrhagia (II-2B). The graphical scoring system presented is a validated tool which offers a simple yet practical method that can be used by patients to quantify their blood loss (II-2B). 2. Because underlying bleeding disorders are frequent in women with menorrhagia, physicians should consider performing a hemoglobin/hematocrit, platelet count, ferritin, PT (INR) and APTT in women with menorrhagia. In women who have a personal history of other bleeding or a family history of bleeding, further investigation should be considered, including a vWD workup (factor VIII, vWF antigen, and vWF functional assay) (II-2B). 3. Treatment of menorrhagia in women with inherited bleeding disorders should be individualized (III-B). 4. An inherited bleeding disorder is not a contraindication to hormonal therapy (oral contraceptives [II-1B], depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) [II-3B], danazol [II-2B], GnRH analogs [II-3B]) or local treatments (levonorgestrel-releasing IUS [II-1B]) and non-hormonal therapy (antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid [II-1B]) as well as desmopressin (II-1B). These therapies represent first line treatment. Blood products should not be used for women with mild bleeding disorders (III-A). 5. In women who no longer want to preserve their fertility, conservative surgical therapy (ablation) and hysterectomy may be options (III-B). Clinicians may consult the ""SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline: Guidelines for the Management of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding"" for an in-depth discussion of the available therapeutic modalities, both medical and surgical. To minimize the risk of intraoperative and post-operative hemorrhage, coagulation factors should be corrected preoperatively with post-operative monitoring (II-1B). 6. Girls growing up in families with a history of vWD or other inherited bleeding disorders should be tested pre-menarchally to determine whether or not they have inherited the disease to allow both the patient and her family to prepare for her first and subsequent menstrual periods (III-C). 7. In adolescents presenting with menorrhagia, an inherited bleeding disorder should be excluded (III-B). When possible, investigation should be undertaken before oral contraceptive therapy is instituted, as the hormonally induced increase in factor VIII and vWF may mask the diagnosis (II-B). 8. Pregnancy in women with inherited bleeding disorders may require a multidisciplinary approach. A copy of their recommendations should be given to the patient and she should be instructed to present it to the health care provider admitting her to the birthing centre. Women with severe bleeding disorders or with a fetus at risk for a severe bleeding disorder should deliver in a hospital (level three) or where there is access to consultants in obstetrics, anesthesiology, hematology, and pediatrics (III-C). 9. Vacuum extraction, forceps, fetal scalp electrodes, and fetal scalp blood sampling should be avoided if the fetus is known or thought to be at risk for a congenital bleeding disorder. A Caesarean section should be performed for obstetrical indications only (II-2C). 10. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are contraindicated if there is a coagulation defect. There is no contraindication to regional anesthesia if coagulation is normalized. The decision to use regional anesthesia should be made on an individual basis (III-C). 11. The risk of early and late postpartum hemorrhage is increased in women with bleeding disorders. Women with inherited bleeding disorders should be advised about the possibility of excessive postpartum bleeding and instructed to report this immediately (III-B). 12. Intramuscular injections, surgery, and circumcision should be avoided in neonates at risk for a severe hereditary bleeding disorder until adequate workup/preparation are possible (III-B). The quality of evidence reported in this document has been described using the Evaluation of Evidence criteria outlined in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Exam (Table 1).",['Demers C; Derzko C; David M; Douglas J'],2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16100628,"a consensus document has been developed by an anesthesiologist, 2 hematologists, and an obstetrician/gynaecologist. it has been endorsed by their relevant specialty bodies. the document is a consensus document for women with inherited bleeding disorders."
Building the foundation for a community-generated national research blueprint for inherited bleeding disorders: research to advance the health of people with inherited bleeding disorders with the potential to menstruate.,"People who have or had the potential to menstruate (PPM) with inherited bleeding disorders (BD) face particular challenges receiving appropriate diagnosis and care and participating in research. As part of an initiative to create a National Research Blueprint for future decades of research, the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network conducted extensive all-stakeholder consultations to identify the priorities of PPM with inherited BDs and those who care for them. Working group (WG) 4 of the NHF State of the Science Research Summit distilled community-identified priorities for PPM with inherited BDs into concrete research questions and scored their feasibility, impact, and risk. WG4 identified important gaps in the foundational knowledge upon which to base optimal diagnosis and care for PPM with inherited BDs. They defined 44 top-priority research questions concerning lifespan sex biology, pregnancy and the post-partum context, uterine physiology and bleeding, bone and joint health, health care delivery, and patient-reported outcomes and quality-of-life. The needs of PPM will best be advanced with research designed across the spectrum of sex and gender biology, with methodologies and outcome measures tailored to this population, involving them throughout.",['Baldwin MK; Ahmadzia HK; Bartlett DL; Bensen-Kennedy D; Desai V; Haley KM; Herman-Hilker SL; Kilgore AM; Kulkarni R; Lavin M; Luckey S; Matteson KA; Paulyson-Nuñez K; Philipp CS; Ragosta S; Rosen K; Rotellini D; Weyand AC'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36920864,inherited bleeding disorders (BD) are inherited bleeding disorders. they are inherited from a population of people with potential to menstruate. they face particular challenges receiving appropriate diagnosis and care.
Gaps or links between hormonal therapy and schizophrenia? (Review).,"Schizophrenia is considered the most severe and debilitating psychiatric disorder. During the 80's, first reports on abnormalities of the schizophrenic brain which could be objectively observed on MRI, CT scans and other imagistic techniques were published. This showed that schizophrenia is a disorder that goes beyond the functional aspect of the symptomatology. The ties between psychiatry and endocrinology are easily observed, even empirically, by any mental health practitioner, and mirrored by endocrinology specialists. Disorders related to menstruation phase of the menstrual cycle have a code in DSM-V, people expect women 'to have mental disturbances' during puberty, pregnancy, menopause and other periods of life known to cause a hormonal storm. Leaving aside those simple and common beliefs, any mental health specialist can observe the differences between men and women when it comes to psychopathology, and the differences between male and female patients when it comes to a severe disorder such as schizophrenia. Males present more severe symptoms; their evolution is worse and they tend to have more medico-legal issues. On the contrary, the current available treatments for schizophrenia tend to have some side effects easily observed by endocrinologists: from gynecomastia to breast asymmetry in women, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain and other metabolic disorders, the clinic shows us regularly what the science has already told us; that the impact of hormones on the developing brain, starting <i>in utero</i> and going on through life may hold the key to finding better treatments for debilitating disorders such as schizophrenia. This mini-review is focused on the role of estrogen in the evolution of schizophrenia and on reporting trials that showed how hormonal therapy (used mainly for breast cancer and osteoporosis) can improve the outcome of patients with schizophrenia.",['Trifu SC; Istrate D; Miruna DA'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905106,schizophrenia is considered the most severe and debilitating psychiatric disorder. schizophrenia is a disorder that goes beyond the functional aspect of the symptomatology. ties between psychiatry and endocrinology are easily observed.
Timing of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination and Effects on Menstrual Cycle Changes.,"To assess whether menstrual cycle timing (follicular or luteal phase) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine administration is associated with cycle length changes. We used prospectively collected (2021-2022) menstrual cycle tracking data from 19,497 reproductive-aged users of the application ""Natural Cycles."" We identified whether vaccine was delivered in the follicular or luteal phase and also included an unvaccinated control group. Our primary outcome was the adjusted within-individual change in cycle length (in days) from the average of the three menstrual cycles before the first vaccination cycle (individuals in the unvaccinated control group were assigned a notional vaccine date). We also assessed cycle length changes in the second vaccination cycle and whether a clinically significant change in cycle length (8 days or more) occurred in either cycle. Most individuals were younger than age 35 years (80.1%) and from North America (28.6%), continental Europe (33.5%), or the United Kingdom (31.7%). In the vaccinated group, the majority received an mRNA vaccine (63.8% of the full sample). Individuals vaccinated in the follicular phase experienced an average 1-day longer adjusted cycle length with a first or second dose of COVID-19 vaccine compared with their prevaccination average (first dose: 1.00 day [98.75% CI, 0.88-1.13], second dose: 1.11 days [98.75% CI, 0.93-1.29]); those vaccinated in the luteal phase and those in the unvaccinated control group experienced no change in cycle length (respectively, first dose: -0.09 days [98.75% CI, -0.26 to 0.07], second dose: 0.06 days [98.75% CI, -0.16 to 0.29], unvaccinated notional first dose: 0.08 days [98.75% CI, -0.10 to 0.27], second dose: 0.17 days [98.75% CI, -0.04 to 0.38]). Those vaccinated during the follicular phase were also more likely to experience a clinically significant change in cycle length (8 days or more; first dose: 6.8%) than those vaccinated in the luteal phase or unvaccinated (3.3% and 5.0%, respectively; P <.001). COVID-19 vaccine-related cycle length increases are associated with receipt of vaccination in the first half of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase).",['Edelman A; Boniface ER; Male V; Cameron S; Benhar E; Han L; Matteson KA; van Lamsweerde A; Pearson JT; Darney BG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38412506,"menstrual cycle timing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine administration is associated with cycle length changes. menstrual cycle timing of vaccine administration is associated with cycle length changes. most individuals were younger than 35 years (80.1%) and from north America (28.6%), continental Europe (33.5%), or the united kingdom (31.7%)"
Effects of the menstrual cycle phase on anterior cruciate ligament neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk surrogates in eumenorrheic and naturally menstruating women: A systematic review.,"Eumenorrheic women experience cyclic variations in sex hormones attributed to the menstrual cycle (MC) which can impact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) properties, knee laxity, and neuromuscular function. This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of the MC on ACL neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk surrogates during dynamic tasks, to establish whether a particular MC phase predisposes women to greater ACL injury risk. PubMed, Medline, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched (May-July 2021) for studies that investigated the effects of the MC on ACL neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk surrogates. Inclusion criteria were: 1) injury-free women (18-40 years); 2) verified MC phases via biochemical analysis and/or ovulation kits; 3) examined neuromuscular and/or biomechanical injury risk surrogates during dynamic tasks; 4) compared ≥1 outcome measure across ≥2 defined MC phases. Seven of 418 articles were included. Four studies reported no significant differences in ACL injury risk surrogates between MC phases. Two studies showed evidence the mid-luteal phase may predispose women to greater risk of non-contact ACL injury. Three studies reported knee laxity fluctuated across the MC; two of which demonstrated MC attributed changes in knee laxity were associated with changes in knee joint loading (KJL). Study quality (Modified Downs and Black Checklist score: 7-9) and quality of evidence were low to very low (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation: very low). It is inconclusive whether a particular MC phase predisposes women to greater non-contact ACL injury risk based on neuromuscular and biomechanical surrogates. Practitioners should be cautious manipulating their physical preparation, injury mitigation, and screening practises based on current evidence. Although variable (i.e., magnitude and direction), MC attributed changes in knee laxity were associated with changes in potentially hazardous KJLs. Monitoring knee laxity could therefore be a viable strategy to infer possible ACL injury risk.","[""Dos'Santos T; Stebbings GK; Morse C; Shashidharan M; Daniels KAJ; Sanderson A""]",2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36701354,"systematic review of effects of the menstrual cycle phase on anterior cruciate ligament neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk surrogates. eumenorrheic women experience cyclic variations in sex hormones attributed to the menstrual cycle (MC) which can impact anterior cruciate ligament properties, knee laxity, and neuromuscular function."
The relationship between the severity of perimenstrual symptoms and a regular exercise habit in Japanese young women: a cross-sectional online survey.,"Experiencing perimenstrual symptoms is a major health concern for young women. Women in the reproductive age experience menstruation about once a month, and many experience perimenstrual symptoms. Drug therapies such as painkillers (commonly used) and hormonal medications help to achieve symptomatic relief from perimenstrual symptoms. However, many women are concerned about tolerance and compliance of the drugs used to treat perimenstrual symptoms and lack awareness on how to cope with perimenstrual symptoms. If the association between exercise habits and the severity of symptoms is emphasized in young women, methods for coping with perimenstrual symptoms can be established, not relying only on pharmaceuticals. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the severity of perimenstrual symptoms in young Japanese women with and without a regular exercise habit. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was sent among 500 Japanese women aged 18-25 years. The severity of perimenstrual symptoms was assessed using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ). The differences in MDQ scores between those with and without exercise habits (exercise for more than 30 min for 2 days a week) were compared using the chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test. The logistic regression analysis detected subscales of the premenstrual and menstrual symptoms affected by an exercise habit. 282 (56.4%) young Japanese women were answered this survey. Respondents were divided into the exercise group (n = 157) and the non-exercise group (n = 125). The exercise group had significantly low premenstrual and menstrual MDQ scores. The results of the logistic regression analysis stated that the subscale related to negative emotion before menstruation was associated with an exercise habit. In the analysis performed during menstruation, a statistically significant association was detected between an exercise habit and a behavioral change such as avoiding interaction with others. This study suggested that exercise habits may reduce the severity of perimenstrual symptoms and could help to develop a non-pharmacological coping strategy. In addition, this study provides useful information for young women who want to prevent perimenstrual symptoms but do not have an exercise habit. Further, it may encourage young women to start exercising.",['Mizuta R; Maeda N; Komiya M; Suzuki Y; Tashiro T; Kaneda K; Tsutsumi S; Ishihara H; Kuroda S; Urabe Y'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35643459,cross-sectional online survey sent among 500 women aged 18-25 years. women in reproductive age experience menstruation about once a month. many women are concerned about tolerance and compliance of the drugs used to treat perimenstrual symptoms.
Analysis of sex hormones and menstruation in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age.,"Does SARS-CoV-2 infection have an effect on ovarian reserve, sex hormones and menstruation of women of child-bearing age? This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which clinical and laboratory data from 237 women of child-bearing age diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Menstrual data from 177 patients were analysed. Blood samples from the early follicular phase were tested for sex hormones and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Among 237 patients with confirmed COVID-19, severely ill patients had more comorbidities than mildly ill patients (34% versus 8%), particularly for patients with diabetes, hepatic disease and malignant tumours. Of 177 patients with menstrual records, 45 (25%) patients presented with menstrual volume changes, and 50 (28%) patients had menstrual cycle changes, mainly a decreased volume (20%) and a prolonged cycle (19%). The average sex hormone and AMH concentrations of women of child-bearing age with COVID-19 were not different from those of age-matched controls. Average sex hormone concentrations and ovarian reserve did not change significantly in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age. Nearly one-fifth of patients exhibited a menstrual volume decrease or cycle prolongation. The menstruation changes of these patients might be the consequence of transient sex hormone changes caused by suppression of ovarian function that quickly resume after recovery.",['Li K; Chen G; Hou H; Liao Q; Chen J; Bai H; Lee S; Wang C; Li H; Cheng L; Ai J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33288478,menstrual data from 237 women of child-bearing age were analysed. 177 patients were analysed for sex hormones and anti-Müllerian hormone. sex hormones and ovarian reserve did not change significantly in women of child-bearing age.
From stigma to solutions: harnessing local wisdom to tackle harms associated with menstrual seclusion (<i>chhaupadi</i>) in Nepal.,"In Nepal, menstrual practices, and particularly <i>chhaupadi</i>, impose restrictive norms affecting women's daily lives. Chhaupadi is a tradition that involves isolating women and girls during menstruation and after childbirth, along with following other restrictions, which have physical and mental health implications. To date, interventions have yet to fully and sustainably address harms associated with chhaupadi across the country. This two-phase study conducted in Dailekh, Nepal facilitated the development of community-created solutions to mitigate chhaupadi's adverse impacts on women's health. Using Human Centred Design and a community-engaged approach, the discovery phase identified key stakeholders and contextualised chhaupadi, while the subsequent design phase facilitated the development of five community-created interventions. These included leveraging female community health volunteers (FCHVs) for counselling and awareness, targeting mothers to drive behavioural change, engaging the wider community in behaviour change efforts, empowering fathers to catalyse change at home, and training youth for advocacy. The FCHV intervention concept was selected as the most promising intervention by the women co-design team, warranting broader exploration and testing. Additionally, while it is imperative for interventions to prioritise tackling deleterious aspects of chhaupadi, interventions must also acknowledge its deep-rooted cultural significance and history and recognise the positive aspects that some women may wish to preserve.",['Baumann SE; Rabin MA; Hawk M; Devkota B; Upadhaya K; Shrestha GR; Joseph B; Burke JG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38970806,menstrual practices impose restrictive norms affecting women's daily lives. chhaupadi is a tradition that involves isolating women and girls during menstruation and after childbirth.
Is Neonatal Uterine Bleeding Involved in Early-Onset Endometriosis?,"There has been considerable progress in our understanding of endometriosis, but its pathophysiology remains uncertain. Uncovering the underlying mechanism of the rare instances of endometriosis reported in early postmenarcheal years and in girls before menarche can have wide implications. We conducted a literature review of all relevant articles on Medline. In the review, we explore the pathogenetic theories of premenarcheal endometriosis, the role of retrograde menstruation in the adult and its potential role in early-onset disease, as well as the factors that argue against the existence of a link between early-onset endometriosis (EOE) and neonatal uterine bleeding (NUB). As with endometriosis in adult women, the pathogenesis of early-onset disease remains unclear. A link between NUB and EOE is plausible, but there are considerable challenges to collating supporting evidence. The state of our understanding of early uterine development and of the pathophysiology of NUB leaves many unknowns that need exploration. These include proof of the existence of viable endometrial cells or endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in NUB, their passage to the pelvic cavity, their possible response to steroids, and whether they can reside within the pelvic cavity and remain dormant till menarche.",['Habiba M; Guo SW; Benagiano G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785956,"a link between early-onset endometriosis and a link between EOE and ub remains unclear. a link between EOE and ub is plausible, but there are considerable challenges to collating supporting evidence."
Polarized running training adapted to versus contrary to the menstrual cycle phases has similar effects on endurance performance and cardiovascular parameters.,"This study compared the effects of polarized running training adapted to the menstrual cycle (MC) phases versus polarized training adapted contrary to the MC on endurance performance and cardiovascular parameters. Thirty-three naturally menstruating, moderately trained females (age: 26 ± 4 years; BMI: 22.3 ± 3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mover><mi>V</mi> <mo>˙</mo></mover> </math> O<sub>2max/rel</sub>: 40.35 ± 4.61 ml/min/kg) were randomly assigned to a control (CON) and intervention (INT) group. Both groups participated in a load-matched eight-week running training intervention. In the INT, high-intensity sessions were aligned with the mid and late follicular phase, low-intensity sessions with the early and mid-luteal phase, and recovery with the late luteal and early follicular phase. In the CON, high-intensity sessions were matched to the late luteal and early follicular phase, and recovery to the mid and late follicular phase. Endurance performance and cardiovascular parameters were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Twenty-six females completed the intervention. A repeated measures ANOVA determined no time × group interaction effect for any parameter. A significant time effect was found for maximal oxygen uptake (F(1,12) = 18.753, p = 0.005, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.630), the velocity at the ventilatory threshold one (F(1,12) = 10.704, p = 0.007, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.493) and two (F(1,12) = 7.746, p = .018, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .413).

How do phases of the menstrual cycle affect sleep? A polysomnographic study of the EPISONO database.,"Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the menstrual cycle stages, especially menses, on sleep, inflammatory mediators, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. We used data from the EPISONO study cohort, selecting 96 women who had undergone one-night polysomnography. The women were distributed in three groups according to the time point of the menstrual cycle on the polysomnography night: menses, mid/late follicular phase, and luteal phase. The volunteers completed questionnaires related to sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Blood samples were collected to analyze interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein. Sleep efficiency was statistically higher in women in the mid/late follicular group (89.9% ± 9.6) compared to menstrual (83.0% ± 10.8) and luteal (83.7% ± 12.7) groups. The mid/late follicular group presented a statistically significant reduction in sleep onset latency (7.1 ± 7.1 min) compared to the menstrual (22.3 ± 32.4 min) and luteal groups (15.9 ± 14.7 min). No statistical differences among the three groups were observed in other polysomnographic parameters, inflammatory mediators, daytime sleepiness, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Our findings demonstrate that the mid/late follicular phase might be beneficial for women's sleep, although there were no statistically changes in inflammatory mediators among the groups.",['Ishikura IA; Moysés-Oliveira M; Fernandes GL; Hachul H; Tufik S; Andersen ML'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38315317,study aimed to evaluate the impact of the menstrual cycle stages on sleep. women were distributed in three groups according to the time point of the menstrual cycle.
The effects of educating mothers and girls on the girls' attitudes toward puberty health: a randomized controlled trial.,"The attitude of a girl toward her menstruation and puberty has a considerable impact on her role during motherhood, social adjustment, and future marital life. This study was conducted in 2014 with the aim of comparing the effects of educating mothers and girls on the attitudes of adolescent girls of Tabriz City, Iran, towards puberty health. This randomized control clinical trial was conducted on 364 adolescent girls who experienced menstruation. Twelve schools were selected randomly among 107 secondary schools for girls. One-third of the students of each school were selected randomly using a table of random numbers and socio-demographic and each participant was asked to answer the attitude questionnaires. The schools were randomly allocated to the groups of mother's education, girl's education, and no-intervention. The attitude questionnaire was filled out by the participants again 2 months after intervention. The general linear model, in which the baseline values were controlled, was employed to compare the scores of the three groups after the intervention. No significant differences were observed among the three groups in terms of the attitude score before intervention (p>0.05). Attitude score improvement after intervention in the girl's education group was significantly higher than the one of both mother's education (adjusted mean difference [AMD]: 1.8; [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-1.3]) and no-intervention groups (AMD: 1.3; [95% CI: 0.0-2.6]) by controlling the attitude score before intervention. Based on the findings, it is more effective to educate girls directly about puberty health to improve adolescent girls' attitudes than educating mothers and asking them to transfer information to the girls. Nevertheless, studies with longer training period and follow-up are proposed to determine the effects of educating girls (through their mothers) on their attitudes about puberty health.",['Afsari A; Mirghafourvand M; Valizadeh S; Abbasnezhadeh M; Galshi M; Fatahi S'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26360494,study was conducted on 364 adolescent girls who experienced menstruation. twelve schools were selected randomly among 107 secondary schools for girls.
Understanding factors related to healthcare avoidance for menstrual disorders and menopausal symptoms: A cross-sectional study among women in Japan.,"This study explored the factors associated with healthcare avoidance behavior for menstrual disorders and menopausal symptoms among women in Japan. Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional online survey conducted in September 2022, responses from 4,950 women aged 25-59 were analyzed. This study applied binomial logistic regression models specifically to participants who reported having ever felt the need to seek healthcare assistance due to health issues related to menstruation and menopause. We computed adjusted odds ratios for key sociodemographic traits, work environment factors, health literacy, menstrual and menopausal symptoms, and attitudes and understanding regarding women's health, associated with healthcare avoidance behavior in the past 12 months. As a sensitivity analysis, a regression was performed limited to those who are working. The results showed that 50.6% of respondents recognized the need for healthcare support for menstrual or menopausal health issues, but 22.8% exhibited healthcare avoidance in the past year. Younger and high-income individuals showed higher avoidance rates. Those with diagnosed gynecological conditions and those perceiving menstrual pain as something to endure also displayed increased avoidance tendencies. Women experiencing significant health effects beyond work and those lacking understanding of the purpose of health check-ups were more prone to healthcare avoidance. Our results underscore the importance of implementing strategically tailored health education initiatives, and re-examining societal attitudes concerning women's health, in order to cultivate enhanced healthcare-seeking behaviors among women.",['Uchibori M; Eguchi A; Ghaznavi C; Tanoue Y; Ueta M; Sassa M; Suzuki S; Honda S; Kawata Y; Iida M; Sakamoto H; Nomura S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37869541,"cross-sectional online survey conducted in 2022 analyzed 4,950 women aged 25-59. participants reported having ever felt the need to seek healthcare assistance due to health issues related to menstruation and menopause."
Influence of female sex hormones on proactive behavioral and physiological immune parameters.,"Women may be more susceptible to infections in the luteal phase, supposedly as a consequence of the hormone progesterone and its immunosuppressive action. While immunosuppression may be important for successful oocyte implantation and pregnancy, it makes women more vulnerable to pathogens. According to theory, to compensate for reduced immunocompetence, women in the luteal phase exhibit proactive behavioral responses, such as disgust and avoidance of disease-associated stimuli, to minimize contagion risk. However, previous studies yielded inconsistent results, and did not account for accompanying proactive immune responses, like the increase of secretory immunoglobin A (sIgA). Here, we assessed the proactive immune response and feelings of disgust associated with disease cues in the comparison of 61 woman with a natural menstrual cycle (31 in the follicular and 30 in the luteal phase) and 20 women taking hormonal contraception (HC). Women rated disease vulnerability and disgust propensity, watched a video displaying people with respiratory symptoms, which was evaluated for its disgust-evoking potential and contagiousness, and provided saliva samples for hormone and sIgA analysis. Women with HC reported a heightened vulnerability to disease compared to naturally cycling women, whereas both the feeling of disgust and the sIgA increase elicited by the disease video were similar across groups, regardless of progesterone. We found a u-shaped relationship between progesterone and baseline sIgA in naturally cycling women, with its nadir during ovulation. Overall, our data do not support a compensatory relationship between the proposed progesterone-induced immunosuppression and heightened disgust or a proactive sIgA response.",['Keller JK; Diekhof EK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38581902,women in the luteal phase exhibit proactive behavioral responses. women in the luteal phase exhibit disgust and avoidance of disease-associated stimuli. women with HC reported a heightened vulnerability to disease compared to naturally cycling women.
Permanent longitudinal strain damage of cardiotoxic drugs in childhood cancer: What is the safe level?,"Anthracycline administration in children is associated with cardiac dysfunction. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) can detect subclinical cardiac damage that may go undetected by conventional two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. This study aims to investigate medium-term anthracycline cardiotoxicity using STE and determine a safer administrable level of anthracyclines (ACs). This observational case-control study enrolled 37 healthy controls and 78 pediatric cancer survivors who received chemotherapy. The patients were divided into two groups: cardiotoxic received (CR) and cardiotoxic free (CF). Data on segmental longitudinal strain (LS), global LS (GLS), and 2D echocardiographic parameters were collected after a drug-free period of at least one year. A total of 115 children with a mean age of 108 ± 55 months, of whom 66% were males, were included in the study. Both the groups of cancer survivors exhibited significantly reduced GLS compared to healthy controls (CR vs. controls, <i>P</i> = 0.001; CF vs. controls, <i>P</i> = 0.013), but no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was observed (<i>P</i> = 0.75). Overall, cancer survivors treated with ACs demonstrated a significant reduction in strain in 10 left ventricular segments, particularly in the basal segments (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Among CR patients, those with impaired GLS (<i>n</i> = 43, GLS worse than -21.9) had significantly higher mean age and cumulative anthracycline dose compared to CR patients with normal GLS (age, <i>P</i> = 0.024; anthracycline dosage, <i>P</i> = 0.036). Using an anthracycline cutoff of 223 mg/m<sup>2</sup> resulted in a higher detection rate (49% vs. 25%) and fewer missed cases (51% vs. 74%) compared to the 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup> anthracycline cutoff. Childhood cancer survivors demonstrate significantly reduced GLS while preserving a normal LVEF, which does not differ significantly from reference values of healthy children. The reduction in strain appears to be associated with higher anthracycline doses and older age. Lowering the anthracycline threshold to 223 mg/m<sup>2</sup> may improve the predictability of a decline in cardiac function using strain imaging at medium-term follow-up.",['Mohammadi H; Hosseini H; Bordbar M; Mehdizadegan N; Amoozgar H; Edraki MR; Naghshzan A; Naderi N; Abedi E; Keshavarz K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38933046,STE can detect subclinical cardiac damage that may go undetected. 78 pediatric cancer survivors received chemotherapy. 37 healthy controls and 78 pediatric cancer survivors were included in the study.
"Menstruation behaviour influencer model: a grounded theory of menstrual experiences of shame, embarrassment, stigma and absenteeism among pubescent girls in semi-urban and rural secondary schools in Enugu State, Nigeria.","severally, studies had identified menstrual-associated shame, embarrassment, stigma, and absenteeism among pubescents in school with resultant challenges on their bio psycho-social functioning. However, what is not clear is the contribution of the home and school to the experiences. The objectives of the study were to explore the experiences with menstruation and menstrual hygiene management; explore the experiences with menstrual-associated shame, embarrassment, stigma, and absenteeism among participants; explore the bio-psycho-social issues associated with the experiences; understand the meaning of the experiences and propose a mid-range theory that explains the influences on pubescents´ menstrual behaviours. constructivist grounded theory design was used to explore the experiences of 20 purposively recruited pubescents from rural and semi-urban secondary schools. In-depth Interviews, focused group discussions, key informant interviews, and observations were employed to collect data until data saturation. Open and focused coding was conducted to identify emerging themes and sub-themes. These themes were returned to participants and literature for verification. four (4) categories and eleven (11) sub-categories emerged from the data and formed four (4) themes that influence pubescents´ menstrual behaviour. They include: 1) individuals´ bio-physiological status, knowledge of menstrual health and menstrual characteristics; 2) regimenting school through strict rule enforcement, punishment/motivation, forced participation, and compliance; 3) scheduling academic activities/examination, sporting and other extra curricula activities; and 4) providing menstrual support by individual and institutional efforts to pubescents. Based on the relationship with other themes, the menstrual behaviour influencer model was proposed. menstrual influencers require the interaction between menstrual support and menstrual enablers by institutions for positive menstrual behavior. Failure to achieve this balance will lead to menstrual-associated shame, embarrassment, stigma, absenteeism, and school drop-out.",['Ubochi NE; Chinweuba UA; Iheanacho NP; Osuchukwu EC; Nwodo CO; Nnamani AJ; Ogbonnaya NP; Ubochi VN'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37575520,"study identified menstrual-associated shame, embarrassment, stigma, and absenteeism among pubescent girls in school. but what is not clear is the contribution of the home and school to the experiences."
Gray Matter Differences Between Premature Pubertal Girls With and Without the Reactivation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis.,"The onset of puberty and related hormones exerts significant effects on brain morphometric and psychosocial development. The biological mechanisms underlying how the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and puberty-related hormonal maturation sculpts human brain architecture remain elusive. To address this question, 105 premature pubertal girls (age 8-11 years) without menstruation underwent brain structural scanning on a 3T MR system, and the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) stimulation test was used to identify the reactivation of the HPG axis. Among the 105 girls, 63 were positive for HPG axis reactivation (HPG+), while the others showed negative (HPG-). Cortical thickness was calculated and compared between the two groups after adjusting for age. The brain regions showing inter-group differences were then extracted and correlated with the peak value of serum hormone after the LHRH stimulation test in entire sample. Compared to HPG- girls, HPG+ girls showed reduced cortical thickness mainly in the the right precuneus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right superior frontal gyrus, while increased cortical thickness primarily in the left superior parietal lobe and right inferior parietal lobe. Linear-regression analysis revealed negative correlations between the cortical thickness of the right inferior parietal lobe with the peak value of FSH and the right precuneus with LH and E. These findings provide evidence to support the notion that the reactivation of HPG axis and changes of hormones during the early phase of hormonal maturation exert influences on the development of gray matter.",['Fu Y; Zhang W; Tao B; Yang B; Yang D; Xie X; Liu P; Zhu Y; Zhou L; Chen T; Liu X; Yan Z'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32848948,105 premature pubertal girls without menstruation underwent brain structural scanning. luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) stimulation test was used to identify reactivation of the HPG axis. cortical thickness was calculated and compared between the two groups.
A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Role of Combined Diagnostic Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy in the Management of Female Infertility.,"Introduction Infertility affects approximately 10-15% of couples worldwide. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy are two newer modalities available for the evaluation of infertility and are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Each provides useful information that the other may not have and each has its advantages. Materials and methods A total of 75 patients of female infertility (study group) in the age group of 18-40 years from the Outpatient Department (OPD) were recruited. Infertility was defined as one year of unprotected intercourse without pregnancy. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were carried out in each patient at the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Hysteroscopic findings were compared with laparoscopic findings for uterine and tubal pathology. Hysteroscopy as a procedure was also compared with laparoscopy as a one-step procedure for diagnostic accuracy in investigating a case of female infertility. The data was analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp., Version 29.0, Armonk, NY). Observations and results In our study, out of a total of 75 cases evaluated for infertility, primary infertility patients were 48 (64%) and secondary infertility patients were 27 (36%). In our study, both tubes were patent on chromopertubation in primary infertility (PI) vs secondary infertility (SI) in 49.33% vs 21.33% of total cases. Both tubes were blocked in PI vs SI in 9.33% vs 8% of total cases. In our study, 20 patients (26.66%) underwent hysteroscopic intervention. Adhesiolysis was the commonest procedure required in seven (9.33%) followed by hysteroscopic cannulation in six (8%). In our study, a total of 30 procedures were performed in 20 patients during laparoscopy. The most common procedure required was ovarian drilling in 22.66% (17/75) followed by surgery for endometriosis in 10.66% (8/75). Adhesiolysis was required in 5/75 (6.66%). Both laparoscopy and hysteroscopy were normal in 44/75 cases for uterine findings. Conclusion Thus, hysterolaparoscopy as ""one step"" had various advantages in our study, more accuracy in the findings and therapeutic intervention in the same sitting reducing the cost. The addition of hysteroscopy to laparoscopy is invaluable in the infertility workup as it has a definite edge in the detection of uterine pathology, as well as being therapeutic at the same time. More accuracy in the diagnostic findings and therapeutic intervention in the same setting will help in reducing the time and cost of treatment.",['Sharma P; Jhanwar A; Kumari K; Arya J; Bharti B; Majeed B; Dabas D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38344511,a prospective study to evaluate the role of Combined Diagnostic Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy in the management of female infertility. the results of the study were compared with laparoscopic findings for uterine and tubal pathology.
"""You have Endometriosis"": Making Menstruation-Related Pain Legitimate in a Biomedical World.","In this essay, the author reflects on how biomedical and gendered perceptions of reproductive health can impact an illness experience. Using a narrative lens, she relays the frustration of attempting to have her excessive menstrual pain legitimated and treated when loved ones and medical professionals trivialized it and refused to let her take on the sick role. She recounts incidents that demonstrate the embedded and limiting persistence of gendered perceptions of pain. In the end, she argues that only through strong patient self-advocacy and knowledge can one rewrite the social scripts assigned to how women cope with menstrual pain.",['Wright KO'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29465255,author reflects on how gendered perceptions of menstrual pain can impact an illness experience. she recounts incidents that demonstrate the embedded and limiting persistence of gendered perceptions of pain.
Mediating effect of suicidal ideation in the association between child abuse and premenstrual syndrome among female adults.,"Premenstrual symptoms encompass a range of physical, emotional, and behavioral changes that cyclically occur before menstruation. Childhood abuse has been associated with subsequent mental health challenges, yet its relationship with exacerbating premenstrual symptoms remains an understudied area. Furthermore, suicidal ideation often emerges from traumatic backgrounds such as child abuse, creating another layer of complexity. Given the rising suicide rates in Lebanon, and the concurrent increase in reported child abuse cases, this research focuses on the role of suicidal ideation as a mediator between child abuse and premenstrual syndrome. This cross-sectional study involved 915 female university students in Lebanon. Participants completed an online questionnaire encompassing demographic details, health lifestyle, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and Child Abuse Self Report Scale (CASRS-12). The mediation analysis was conducted using PROCESS MACRO v3.4 model 4; three pathways derived from this analysis: pathway A from the independent variable to the mediator, pathway B from the mediator to the dependent variable, Pathway C indicating the direct effect from the independent to the dependent variable. The results of the mediation analysis showed that suicidal ideation mediated the association between all types of child abuse and the presence of PMS. Higher psychological (Beta = 0.21; p < 0.001), neglect (Beta = 0.02; p = 0.017), physical (Beta = 0.19; p < 0.001) and sexual (Beta = 0.20, p < 0.001) child abuse were significantly associated with higher suicidal ideation, which was significantly associated with the presence of PMS (Beta = 0.38, p = 0.001; Beta = 0.57, p < 0.001; Beta = 0.45, p < 0.001; and Beta = 0.50, p < 0.001) respectively. Finally, higher psychological (Beta = 0.17, p < 0.001), physical (Beta = 0.11, p = 0.024), but not sexual (Beta = 0.07, p = 0.198) child abuse was directly and significantly associated with the presence of PMS, whereas higher neglect (Beta = -0.06, p = 0.007) was significantly associated lower odds of having PMS. This study highlights the mediating role of suicidal ideation in the complex association between different types of childhood abuse and premenstrual symptoms. The findings emphasize the need for trauma-informed care and tailored interventions to address the diverse impact of these factors. Recognizing the intricate relationships between child abuse, suicidal ideation, and PMS can aid healthcare providers in comprehensively addressing young women's mental and reproductive well-being. Trauma-informed care, tailored interventions and awareness of potential connections between childhood maltreatment are essential in managing these complex challenges.",['Kfoury M; Malaeb D; Moubarak P; Sakr F; Dabbous M; Hallit S; Fekih-Romdhane F; Obeid S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38326825,study involved 915 female university students in Lebanon. participants completed questionnaire. study focuses on role of suicidal ideation as mediator between child abuse and premenstrual syndrome.
Improving the sexual health of women with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review of published studies.,"An essential aspect of human well-being is positive sexual health outcomes. However, the issue of adverse sexual health outcomes continues to be a major public health concern, particularly for women with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, this current scoping review mapped studies conducted in the last twenty-nine years on the sexual health of women with disabilities from these five dimensions: sexual activity, contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, sexual violence and risky sexual behaviour, whilst seeking to identify the current state of knowledge and address the study gaps in SSA. This current scoping review was informed by the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. Exploratory searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, African Journals Online, etc., to identify studies conducted in SSA that focus on sexual activity, contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, sexual violence and risky sexual behaviour among women with disabilities in SSA since the inception of the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 to 30th of March 2024. This process resulted in the inclusion of seventeen (17) studies. Of the 1362 identified through various databases, 34 studies were included for the full-text retrieval and screening; only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The eligible studies were conducted across six countries in SSA and published between 2008 and 2023. Eight studies used quantitative study type, six utilised qualitative approach, and three employed mixed-methods analysis. Two studies were conducted on sexual activity, ten were conducted on contraceptive use, four were conducted on sexual violence, and one study was conducted on risky sexual behaviour, whilst no study on sexual autonomy met the inclusion criteria. This review showed that there were few or scarce studies on sexual activity, contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, sexual violence and risky sexual behaviour among women with disabilities in SSA and even where the studies were substantial (contraceptive use), the majority of the studies were conducted in a country. Future studies should consider examining dimensions of sexual health, such as sexual autonomy, sexual activity and risky sexual behaviour of women with disabilities that were not available or were scarce in the literature.",['Bolarinwa OA; Odimegwu C; Tapera T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39107772,"current scoping review mapped studies conducted in the last twenty-nine years. study focused on sexual activity, contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, sexual violence and risky sexual behaviour among women with disabilities in SSA."
Women's preferences for menstrual bleeding frequency: results of the Inconvenience Due to Women's Monthly Bleeding (ISY) survey.,"Our aim was to assess the level of inconvenience associated with monthly bleeding, determine how many women would prefer a bleeding frequency of less than once a month, and what would motivate their choice. A 15-min quantitative online survey was carried out among 2883 women aged between 18 and 45 years in six European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Poland and Spain). Of those surveyed, 1319 women used a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC group) and 1564 used a non-hormonal contraceptive or no contraceptive (non-HC group). The menstrual period was significantly longer (5 vs. 4.5 days), heavier (16% vs. 8% heavy menstrual flow) and associated with more symptoms (6.1 vs. 5.6) in non-HC users than in CHC users (p < 0.0001). More than half of the women in each group reported pelvic pain, bloating/swelling, mood swings and irritability, but the rate was significantly higher in the non-HC group. Given the choice, 57% of women in both groups said they would opt for longer intervals between periods. Sexuality, social life, work and sporting activities were key factors affecting their decision. The majority of women would prefer to have menstrual periods less than once a month, with a frequency ranging from once every 3 months to no periods at all. This can be explained by the desire to avoid the unpleasant aspects of menstruation and its negative impact on private and professional life.",['Nappi RE; Fiala C; Chabbert-Buffet N; Häusler G; Jamin C; Lete I; Lukasiewic M; Pintiaux A; Lobo P'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27010535,survey was carried out among 2883 women aged between 18 and 45 years. a 15-min quantitative online survey was carried out among 2883 women aged between 18 and 45 years. the majority would prefer menstrual periods less than once a month.
"The Electoral Misinformation Nexus: How News Consumption, Platform Use, and Trust in News Influence Belief in Electoral Misinformation.","Electoral misinformation, where citizens believe false or misleading claims about the electoral process and electoral institutions-sometimes actively and strategically spread by political actors-is a challenge to public confidence in elections specifically and democracy more broadly. In this article, we analyze a combination of 42 million clicks in links and apps from behavioral tracking data of 2,200 internet users and a four-wave panel survey to investigate how different kinds of online news and media use relate to beliefs in electoral misinformation during a contentious political period-the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. We find that, controlling for other factors, using news from legacy news media is associated with belief in fewer claims of electoral misinformation over time. We find null or inconsistent effects for using digital-born news media and various digital platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp. Furthermore, we find that trust in news plays a significant role as a moderator. Belief in electoral misinformation, in turn, undermines trust in news. Overall, our findings document the important role of the news media as an institution in curbing electoral misinformation, even as they also underline the precarity of trust in news during contentious political periods.","[""Mont'Alverne C; Arguedas AR; Banerjee S; Toff B; Fletcher R; Nielsen RK""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39109090,"Electoral misinformation is a challenge to public confidence in elections. we analyze 42 million clicks in links and apps from behavioral tracking data. we find that controlling for other factors, using news from legacy news media is associated with belief in fewer claims of electoral misinformation over time."
What Do the Transcriptome and Proteome of Menstrual Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Tell Us about Endometriosis?,"Given the importance of menstrual blood in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and the multifunctional roles of menstrual mesenchymal stem cells (MenSCs) in regenerative medicine, this issue has gained prominence in the scientific community. Moreover, recent reviews highlight how robust the integrated assessment of omics data are for endometriosis. To our knowledge, no study has applied the multi-omics approaches to endometriosis MenSCs. This is a case-control study at a university-affiliated hospital. MenSCs transcriptome and proteome data were obtained by RNA-seq and UHPLC-MS/MS detection. Among the differentially expressed proteins and genes, we emphasize <i>ATF3, ID1, ID3, FOSB, SNAI1, NR4A1, EGR1, LAMC3,</i> and <i>ZFP36</i> genes and MT2A, TYMP, COL1A1, COL6A2, and NID2 proteins that were already reported in the endometriosis. Our functional enrichment analysis reveals integrated modulating signaling pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (↑) and PI3K signaling via AKT to mTORC1 (↓ in proteome), mTORC1 signaling, TGF beta signaling, TNFA signaling via NFkB, IL6 STAT3 signaling, and response to hypoxia via HIF1A targets (↑ in transcriptome).

Digit ratios and hospitalization for COVID-19: A test of the low-androgen-driven and high-androgen-driven theories of COVID-19 severity.,"Sex hormones are likely to be important determinants of COVID-19 severity, and two opposing explanations regarding severity, the low-androgen-driven and high-androgen-driven theories, seek to explain this pattern. Digit ratios are sex dependent (males < females) and are claimed to be markers for both prenatal and postnatal testosterone. Here, we use a measure of COVID-19severity (hospitalization), compare digit ratios in patients and controls and consider whether vaccination status changed these associations. Four digits were measured (2D, 3D, 4D, 5D). There were 194 participants (94 hospitalized patients [45 men] and 100 controls [53 men]) in Sample I and 162 participants (100 hospitalized [42 men], including 40 vaccinated and 62 controls [32 men]) in Sample II. Six ratios were calculated (2D:3D; 2D:4D; 2D:5D; 3D:4D; 3D:5D, 4D:5D) and compared between COVID-19 hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and vaccinated and non-vaccinated. In comparison to controls, we found higher (""feminized"") means in patient ratios that included 5D (2D:5D; 3D:5D; 4D:5D) in both samples. The differences were independent of sex and age. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have higher (feminized) means and higher standard deviations (SDs) for 5D digit ratios. Digit ratios are sex dependent (males < females) and are considered as markers for both prenatal and postnatal testosterone. If verified in future studies, the results will be helpful in regard to targeting mortality-reducing therapies for COVID-19 in certain groups of patients.

Managing women-specific bleeding in inherited bleeding disorders: A multidisciplinary approach.,"Multidisciplinary management of women-specific bleeding is important to preserve quality of life, healthy reproduction and social participation of women and girls with bleeding disorders (WBD). To support appropriate multidisciplinary care for WBD in haemophilia treatment centres. Two case examples are presented and management issues discussed from different health care perspectives, including the nurse, patient, psychologist, gynaecologist, geneticist, psychosexual therapist and haematologist. Woman with bleeding disorders may experience heavy menstruation from menarche onwards. This has a physical and psychosocial impact requiring a multidisciplinary approach. If a woman with an inherited bleeding disorder desires to become pregnant, preconception counselling is essential, to discuss genetic diagnosis, state of the art treatment options for the bleeding disorder in question and possible choices to prevent having an affected child, as well as maternal bleeding risks during conception, delivery and the post-partum period. Adequate management and good education of WBD requires a patient-centred multidisciplinary approach with experienced specialists in a haemophilia treatment centre.","[""Mauser-Bunschoten EP; Kadir RA; Laan ETM; Elfvinge P; Haverman L; Teela L; Degenaar MEL; Fransen van de Putte DE; D'Oiron R; van Galen KPM""]",2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314402,multidisciplinary management of women-specific bleeding is important to preserve quality of life. to support appropriate multidisciplinary care for WBD in haemophilia treatment centres.
Live birth rate of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist versus luteal phase gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist protocol in IVF/ICSI: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have allowed millions of infertile couples to achieve pregnancy. As an essential part of IVF/ICSI enabling the retrieval of a high number of oocytes in one cycle, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) treatment mainly composes of the standard long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) protocol and the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-ant) protocol. However, the effectiveness of GnRH-ant protocol is still debated because of inconsistent conclusions and insufficient subgroup analyses. This systematic review and meta-analysis included a total of 52 studies, encompassing 5193 participants in the GnRH-ant group and 4757 in the GnRH-a group. The findings of this study revealed that the GnRH-ant protocol is comparable with the long GnRH-a protocol when considering live birth as the primary outcome, and it is a favourable protocol with evidence reducing the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing IVF/ICSI, especially in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Further research is needed to compare the subsequent cumulative live birth rate between the two protocols among the general and poor ovarian response patients since those patients have a lower clinical pregnancy rate, fewer oocytes retrieved or fewer high-grade embryos in the GnRH-ant protocol.",['Liu C; Tian T; Lou Y; Li J; Liu P; Li R; Qiao J; Wang Y; Yang R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38095077,in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer have allowed millions of infertile couples to achieve pregnancy. the effectiveness of the protocol is still debated because of inconsistent conclusions and insufficient subgroup analyses.
Calibration trial of an innovative medical device (<i>NEVVA<sup>©</sup></i> ) for the evaluation of pain in non-communicating patients in the intensive care unit.,"Pain management is an essential and complex issue for non-communicative patients undergoing sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS), although not perfect for assessing behavioral pain, is the gold standard based partly on clinical facial expression. <i>NEVVA<sup>©</sup></i> , an automatic pain assessment tool based on facial expressions in critically ill patients, is a much-needed innovative medical device. In this prospective pilot study, we recorded the facial expressions of critically ill patients in the medical ICU of Caen University Hospital using the iPhone and Smart Motion Tracking System (SMTS) software with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to measure human facial expressions metrically during sedation weaning. Analyses were recorded continuously, and BPS scores were collected hourly over two 8 h periods per day for 3 consecutive days. For this first stage, calibration of the innovative <i>NEVVA<sup>©</sup></i> medical device algorithm was obtained by comparison with the reference pain scale (BPS). Thirty participants were enrolled between March and July 2022. To assess the acute severity of illness, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) were recorded on ICU admission and were 9 and 47, respectively. All participants had deep sedation, assessed by a Richmond Agitation and Sedation scale (RASS) score of less than or equal to -4 at the time of inclusion. One thousand and six BPS recordings were obtained, and 130 recordings were retained for final calibration: 108 BPS recordings corresponding to the absence of pain and 22 BPS recordings corresponding to the presence of pain. Due to the small size of the dataset, a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) strategy was performed, and the training results obtained the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.792. This model has a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 72.2%. This pilot study calibrated the <i>NEVVA<sup>©</sup></i> medical device and showed the feasibility of continuous facial expression analysis for pain monitoring in ICU patients. The next step will be to correlate this device with the BPS scale.",['Bellal M; Lelandais J; Chabin T; Heudron A; Gourmelon T; Bauduin P; Cuchet P; Daubin C; De Carvalho Ribeiro C; Delcampe A; Goursaud S; Joret A; Mombrun M; Valette X; Cerasuolo D; Morello R; Mordel P; Chaillot F; Dutheil JJ; Vivien D; Du Cheyron D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38994344,a trial of an innovative medical device was conducted for the evaluation of pain in non-communicating patients in the intensive care unit. the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) is the gold standard based partly on clinical facial expression. the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) is the gold standard based partly on clinical facial expression.
Adolescent girls' perceptions and cultural beliefs about menstruation and menstrual practices: A scoping review.,"Menstruation is experienced differently among school-going adolescents in various cultures and social contexts. This scoping review summarises the emerging evidence on adolescent girls' perceptions and cultural beliefs about menstruation and menstrual practices. A search was conducted via relevant databases and journals for the period 2004 to 2020. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of the identified articles. The 35 articles included in the review represented adolescent girls' perceptions and cultural beliefs about menstruation and menstrual practices. Narrative analysis revealed that cultural perceptions and beliefs, economic and institutional resources and primary sources of information influenced the experience of menstruation and its management. Menstruation remained shrouded in secrecy and shame for many girls, leading to absenteeism from school. These findings underscore the need to further explore cultural practices and beliefs about menstruation that influence school attendance and long-term educational prospects of adolescent girls.",['Fennie T; Moletsane M; Padmanabhanunni A'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37585000,a scoping review summarises emerging evidence on adolescent girls' perceptions and cultural beliefs about menstruation and menstrual practices. 35 articles represented adolescent girls' perceptions and cultural beliefs about menstruation and menstrual practices.
"Association between tea, coffee and caffeine consumption and risk of female infertility: a cross-sectional study.","To explore the association between tea, coffee, and caffeine consumption and the risk of female infertility. We analyzed data from 2099 females aged 18 to 44 years, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2018. We used generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive model (GAM) to investigate the dose-response relationship between the tea, coffee, and caffeine consumption and infertility, adjusting for potential confounders. A non-linear relationship was detected between tea consumption and infertility and the inflection point was 2 cups/day. On the right side of the inflection point, we did not detect a significant association. However, on the left side, we found a negative relationship between tea consumption and infertility (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.93; P = 0.0122). Meanwhile, our study found no significant association between coffee (0.96, 0.81 to 1.13, P = 0.6189) or caffeine consumption (1.15, 0.93 to 1.42, P = 0.2148) and female infertility.

Therapeutic effects and mechanism of ferulic acid and icariin in mammary gland hyperplasia model rats via regulation of the ERK pathway.,"Ferulic acid (FA) and icariin (ICA), as the active compounds derived from <i>Angelica sinensis</i> and <i>Epimedium brevicornum Maxim</i>, respectively, have been shown to promote blood circulation, regulate menstruation, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, and modulate estrogen levels. The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible mechanism of FA, ICA, and FA-ICA on estrogen-induced mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH) in rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to record the pathological changes in breast tissue, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to determine the serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), PRL (prolactin), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and progesterone (P). The message RNA (mRNA) expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) were detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, ER, phosphorylated-ER, PR, p-PR, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 protein factors in the ERK signaling pathway were evaluated by Western blotting. Simultaneously, changes in breast height, diameter, body weight, and organ index were all recorded. We found that FA and ICA could modulate the degree of breast swelling, and reduce the body weight, thymus index, and uterus index. Furthermore, it could also block the pathological changes of MGH, including the number of mammary lobules, and the proliferation or expansion of acini and ducts. Moreover, treatment with FA and ICA remarkably down-regulated the serum expression levels of LH, PRL, T, and E2, as well as the mRNA expression levels of ERα, PR, ERK1, and ERK2. Additionally, protein levels of ERα, p-ERα, PR, p-PR, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in breast tissue were down-regulated, however the serum content of FSH and P was up-regulated. Our outcomes revealed that FA and ICA might potentially inhibit ERα, PR, ERK1/2, and their phosphorylated proteins via the ERK signaling pathway, thus indicating a positive feedback control for the degree of breast hyperplasia.",['Li X; Shi G'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33987364,ferulic acid (FA) and icariin (ICA) shown to promote blood circulation. icariin (ICA) and i>Angelica sinensis are active compounds. hematoxylin and eosin staining performed to record pathological changes in breast tissue.
Influence of the Menstrual Cycle and Training on the Performance of a Perturbed Single-Leg Squatting Task in Female Collegiate Athletes.,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often occur when an athlete experiences an unexpected disruption, or perturbation, during sports. ACL injury rates may also be influenced by the menstrual cycle. To determine whether training adaptations to knee control and muscle activity during a perturbed single-leg squatting (SLS) task depend on menstrual cycle phase in female athletes. Controlled laboratory study. A total of 21 healthy female collegiate athletes (current or former [<3 years]) who competed in 9 different sports performed an SLS task in which they attempted to match their knee position (user signal) to a target signal. The protocol consisted of a 9-condition pretest, 5 sets of 3 training trials, and a 9-condition posttest. One perturbation was delivered in each condition by altering the resistance of the device. Sagittal knee control (absolute error between the target signal and user signal) was assessed using a potentiometer. Muscle activity during perturbed squat cycles was normalized to maximal activation and to corresponding muscle activity during unperturbed squat cycles (%unperturbed) within the same test condition. Athletes performed the protocol during a distinct menstrual cycle phase (early follicular [EF], late follicular [LF], midluteal [ML]). Two-way mixed analysis of variance was used to determine the effects of the menstrual cycle and training on knee control and muscle activity during task performance. Venous blood was collected for hormonal analysis, and a series of health questionnaires and anthropometric measures were also assessed to determine differences among the menstrual cycle groups. After training, athletes demonstrated better knee control during the perturbed squat cycles (lower absolute error, <i>P</i> < .001) and greater soleus feedback responses to the perturbation (%unperturbed, <i>P</i> = .035). Better knee control was demonstrated in the ML phase versus the EF phase during unperturbed and perturbed squat cycles (<i>P</i> < .039 for both). Quadriceps activation was greater in the ML phase compared with the EF and LF phases, both immediately before and after the perturbation (<i>P</i> < .001 for all). Athletes learned to improve knee control during the perturbed performance regardless of menstrual cycle phase. The best knee control and greatest quadriceps activation during the perturbed squatting task was found in the ML phase. These findings may correspond to a lower incidence of ACL injury in the luteal phase and alterations in exercise performance across the menstrual cycle.",['Johnson KA; Shields RK'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38831876,"anterior cruciate ligament injury occurs when an athlete experiences an unexpected disruption during sports. a total of 21 healthy female collegiate athletes performed an SLS task in which they attempted to match their knee position (user signal) to a target signal. the protocol consisted of a 9-condition pretest, 5 sets of 3 training trials, and a 9-condition posttest."
Indicators for National and Global Monitoring of Girls' Menstrual Health and Hygiene: Development of a Priority Shortlist.,"Despite the importance of menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) for adolescent girls' health, education, and gender equality, few countries monitor MHH. MHH needs remain underprioritized, and progress achieved through policies, programs, or investments go unmeasured. This article reports the systematic development of an indicator shortlist to monitor adolescent girls' MHH at the national and global levels across low- and middle-income countries. A core group of MHH researchers and practitioners collaborated with stakeholders from three countries with demonstrated commitment to monitoring MHH (Bangladesh, Kenya, and the Philippines), measures experts, and a global advisory group. The approach included the following: (1) define domains for monitoring MHH; (2) review and map existing indicators and measures; (3) iteratively shortlist indicators through appraising quality, feasibility, and stakeholder input; and (4) refine the shortlist and develop guidance for use. The shortlist comprises 21 indicators across seven domains covering menstrual materials, water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, knowledge, discomforts and disorders, supportive social environments, menstrual health impacts, and policies. Indicators are accompanied by measures that have been tested or are expected to provide reliable data, alongside justification for their selection and guidance for use. The shortlisted indicators reflect the multisectoral collaboration necessary for ensuring girls' MHH. Uptake requires integration into monitoring systems at national and global levels. Future work remains to evaluate the performance of the indicators over time and to support their widespread use. Governments and stakeholders can use these indicators to track the progress of programs and policies, monitor unmet MHH needs, identify disparities, and set targets for improvement.",['Hennegan J; Caruso BA; Zulaika G; Torondel B; Haver J; Phillips-Howard PA; Valdez J; Gruer C; Okwaro N; Mahon T; Sommer M'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37737755,"indicators for national and global monitoring of girls' menstrual health and hygiene are a priority shortlist. the shortlist includes 21 indicators across seven domains covering menstrual materials, water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. progress achieved through policies, programs, or investments go unmeasured."
Proteomics approach to discovering non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers and understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecological diseases, yet it lacks efficient biomarkers for early detection and unravels disease mechanisms. Proteomic profiling has revealed diverse patterns of protein changes in various clinical samples. Integrating and systematically analysing proteomics data can facilitate the development of biomarkers, expediting diagnosis and providing insights for potential clinical and therapeutic applications. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers in various biological samples and therapeutic targets for endometriosis. Online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, and Google Scholar, were searched using MeSH terms. Two independent authors screened the articles, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. GO and KEGG analyses were performed to identify the pathways that were significantly enriched. Protein‑protein interaction and hub gene selection analyses were also conducted to identify biomarker networks for endometriosis. Twenty-six observational studies with a total of 2,486 participants were included. A total of 644 differentially expressed proteins (180 upregulated and 464 downregulated) were identified from 9 studies. Proteins in peripheral blood exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 38-100% and 59-99%, respectively, for detecting endometriosis, while proteins in urine had a sensitivity of 58-91% and specificity of 76-93%. Alpha-1-antitrypsin, albumin, and vitamin D binding proteins were significantly DEPs in both serum and urine. Complement C3 is commonly expressed in serum, menstrual blood, and cervical mucus. Additionally, S100-A8 is commonly expressed in both menstrual blood and cervical mucus. Haptoglobin is commonly detected in both serum and plasma, whereas cathepsin G is found in urine, serum, and plasma. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that proteoglycans in cancer pathways, which regulate cell-to-cell interactions, modulate the extracellular matrix, and promote the proliferation and invasion of endometrial cells, are commonly enriched in serum and urine. This comprehensive study revealed potential proteomes that were significantly differentially expressed in women with endometriosis utilizing various non-invasive clinical samples. Exploring common differentially expressed proteins in various biological samples provides insights into the diagnosis and pathophysiology of endometriosis, as well as potential clinical and therapeutic applications.",['Azeze GG; Wu L; Alemu BK; Lee WF; Fung LWY; Cheung ECW; Zhang T; Wang CC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39061077,systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers in various biological samples and therapeutic targets for endometriosis.

Second opinion machine learning for fast-track pathway assignment in hip and knee replacement surgery: the use of patient-reported outcome measures.,"The frequency of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries has been rising steadily in recent decades. This trend is attributed to an aging population, leading to increased demands on healthcare systems. Fast Track (FT) surgical protocols, perioperative procedures designed to expedite patient recovery and early mobilization, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hospital stays, convalescence periods, and associated costs. However, the criteria for selecting patients for FT procedures have not fully capitalized on the available patient data, including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Our study focused on developing machine learning (ML) models to support decision making in assigning patients to FT procedures, utilizing data from patients' self-reported health status. These models are specifically designed to predict the potential health status improvement in patients initially selected for FT. Our approach focused on techniques inspired by the concept of controllable AI. This includes eXplainable AI (XAI), which aims to make the model's recommendations comprehensible to clinicians, and cautious prediction, a method used to alert clinicians about potential control losses, thereby enhancing the models' trustworthiness and reliability. Our models were trained and tested using a dataset comprising 899 records from individual patients admitted to the FT program at IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi-Sant'Ambrogio. After training and selecting hyper-parameters, the models were assessed using a separate internal test set. The interpretable models demonstrated performance on par or even better than the most effective 'black-box' model (Random Forest). These models achieved sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) exceeding 70%, with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 80%. The cautious prediction models exhibited enhanced performance while maintaining satisfactory coverage (over 50%). Further, when externally validated on a separate cohort from the same hospital-comprising patients from a subsequent time period-the models showed no pragmatically notable decline in performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing PROMs as basis to develop ML models for planning assignments to FT procedures. Notably, the application of controllable AI techniques, particularly those based on XAI and cautious prediction, emerges as a promising approach. These techniques provide reliable and interpretable support, essential for informed decision-making in clinical processes.",['Campagner A; Milella F; Banfi G; Cabitza F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044277,"the frequency of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries has been rising steadily in recent decades. the trend is attributed to an aging population, leading to increased demands on healthcare systems. the criteria for selecting patients for FT procedures have not capitalized on the available patient data."
"Clinical characteristics, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, and inflammatory markers in individuals with post-COVID-19 condition in Kenya: a cross-sectional study.","Post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) is associated with considerable morbidity and reduced quality of life. However, studies characterizing the post-COVID-19 condition in Kenya are limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition and determine the clinical characteristics, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, and concentrations of inflammatory markers of individuals with post-COVID-19 condition in Kenya. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the Kenyatta University Health Unit, Kenya. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a questionnaire. The serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Independent samples t-test was used to compare the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IL-6, and CRP levels between the participants with and without post-COVID-19 symptoms. The case definition for post-COVID-19 condition was persistence of acute COVID-19 symptoms or emergence of new symptoms 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms lasting for ≥2 months, and absence of any other etiological basis to explain the symptoms. A total of 189 volunteers were recruited in this study (median age: 21 years, range: 18-71 years; male, 49.2%). Forty participants reported having had at least one COVID-19 positive diagnosis in the past, of which 12 (30%) complained of post-COVID-19 symptoms. Significant differences in the number and duration of symptoms were observed between the individuals with and without post-COVID-19 symptoms (<i>t</i>-statistic = 2.87, <i>p</i> = 0.01; <i>t</i>-statistic = 2.39, <i>p</i> = 0.02, respectively). However, no significant differences in serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IL-6, and CRP were observed between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.08, 0.9, and 0.28, respectively). These findings suggest that post-COVID-19 condition is a health concern even for a relatively young population in Kenya and globally. This condition requires more attention and well-designed studies to better define it and identify clinical chemistry markers that can be used for its diagnosis.",['Theuri M; Ndombi EM; Thamaini P; Ogutu JO; Onsongo L; Madete JK; Ofula V; Gitau S; Mwangi G; Okemo P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39056056,post-coVID-19 condition is associated with considerable morbidity and reduced quality of life. studies characterizing post-COVID-19 condition in Kenya are limited.
"Isolation, discrimination, and feeling ""constant Guilt"": A mixed-methods analysis of female physicians' experience with fertility, family planning, and oncology careers.","Family planning among female physicians is harmed by high risks of infertility, workload burden, poor family leave policies, and gender discrimination. Many women report feeling unsupported in the workplace, despite national policies to protect against unfair treatment. This secondary analysis applied a modified version of the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique to conduct a thematic analysis of comments to an open-ended prompt. Comments were coded by multiple trained researchers then grouped and merged into illustrative themes via qualitative techniques. Of 1004 responses to the quantitative survey, 162 physicians completed the open-ended prompt. Initial codes (n = 16) were combined into eight groups including, from which three overarching themes were identified. Institutional barriers were highlighted with comments discussing the increased need for parental leave, part-time options and the concern for academic or professional punishment for being pregnant and/or having children. Departmental barriers were explored with comments grouped around codes of discrimination/negative culture and challenges with breastfeeding/pumping and childcare. Personal barriers were discussed in themes highlighting the difficulties that female physicians faced around the timing of family planning, challenges with reproductive health and assistance, and alternative circumstances and/or decisions against family planning. Barriers to family planning in oncology exist across career domains from dysfunctional maternity leave to poor education on infertility risk. Solutions include improving institutional support, expanding parental leave, and general cultural change to improve awareness and promotion of family and career balance.",['Marion S; Dalwadi SM; Kuczmarska-Haas A; Gillespie EF; Ludwig MS; Holliday EB; Thom B; Chino F; Lee A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39072703,"mixed-methods analysis of female physicians' experience with fertility, family planning, and oncology careers. many women report feeling unsupported in the workplace. many women report feeling unsupported in the workplace."
Female Reproductive and Gynecologic Considerations in Chronic Kidney Disease: Adolescence and Young Adulthood.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increasingly affects younger people, including adolescents and young adults. CKD among females is accompanied by unique reproductive and gynecologic health concerns; though to date, this area has not been well studied. Hormonal disruptions attributed to CKD may underlie the high prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding and influence the age of menarche in adolescents. Period poverty as a socioeconomic barrier further exacerbates the female-specific burdens of CKD. Reduced fertility in CKD is likely multifactorial and may be related to a reduction in ovarian reserve, reproductive hormone disturbances, and gonadotoxic medication use in addition to low sexual function and activity. Fertility, sexual function and activity, and risk of sexually transmitted infections increase with transplantation. Pregnancy is possible at any stage of CKD, although often accompanied by high risks of maternal and fetal complications. Contraception is thus an important consideration in CKD, but use is low and the risks and benefits of different forms in the setting of CKD are not well characterized. Though patients with CKD report reproductive health as an important element of care, many nephrologists report lack of confidence and training in this area, highlighting the need for targeted research and education. The unique reproductive health care needs of the growing transgender youth population warrant attention in nephrology training with multidisciplinary input. This review will discuss female reproductive health and gynecologic considerations in adolescents and young adults with CKD while proposing clinical and research strategies to improve this understudied yet important aspect of kidney care.",['Chang DH; Dumanski SM; Ahmed SB'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35155855,"chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects younger people, including adolescents and young adults. nephrologists report lack of confidence and training in this area."
Targeting osteopontin alleviates endometriosis and inflammation by inhibiting the RhoA/ROS axis and achieves non-invasive in vitro detection via menstrual blood.,"How does osteopontin (OPN) in endometriosis ectopic stromal cells (EESCs) participate in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and achieve non-invasive detection in vitro? Targeted OPN regulates endometriosis's necroptosis and inflammatory state by inhibiting the RhoA/reactive oxygen species (ROS) axis, thereby alleviating endometriosis and enabling non-invasive detection of menstrual blood in vitro. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Recent studies have shown that OPN plays an important role in disease progression by regulating cell death and inflammation. The study included 20 patients diagnosed with endometriosis (confirmed by laparoscopy and histology) and 10 controls without endometriosis. Endometriotic stromal cells were isolated from endometrial samples, while menstrual blood endometrial cells (MESCs) were isolated from menstrual blood. These cells were then cultured in vitro and utilized in subsequent experiments. OPN expression in EESCs was assessed using inflammatory factor sequencing, immunohistochemical staining (IHC), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, and Western blotting (WB). The biological behavior of OPN and its effects on inflammatory factors were examined using EdU, wound-healing, Transwell, and ELISA assays. Necroptosis in EESCs and its impact on inflammatory factors were detected through qRT-PCR, WB, and Calcein-AM/PI fluorescence assays. The examination of mitochondrial stress in EESCs involved the use of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) Assay, ROS detection, and Calcein-AM Loading/cobalt chloride Quenching. qRT-PCR, WB, and other experiments were conducted to verify the regulation of necroptosis and inflammatory factor levels in EESCs by OPN through the RhoA/ROS axis. Knockdown of OPN and its inhibitory effect on endometriosis lesion size were confirmed using AAV9 virus, IHC, qRT-PCR, WB, and other experiments. Additionally, OPN expression in MESCs was detected using transcriptome sequencing, RT-PCR, WB, and other experiments. In vitro assays demonstrated a significant upregulation of OPN in EESCs, and the knockdown of OPN effectively inhibited necroptosis and the release of inflammatory factors. OPN inhibited necroptosis and inflammatory factor release by mediating RhoA-dependent ROS production and blocking mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein phosphorylation at the cell membrane. In vivo, targeting of OPN can inhibit the growth of endometriosis lesions. Clinically, OPN was also significantly upregulated in the menstrual blood of patients with endometriosis. N/A. Due to limitations in obtaining surgical specimens, our study primarily involved collecting endometriosis tissues from women during the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle. We observed a significant overexpression of OPN in the samples used for our investigation. However, the expression of OPN in endometriosis tissues during the intermenstrual phase remains unknown. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the OPN/RhoA/ROS axis in the regulation of necroptosis and the release of inflammatory factors. OPN knockdown exerts a therapeutic effect in vivo, and the high expression detection of OPN in menstrual blood in vitro. In summary, targeting OPN provides possibilities for the treatment and detection of endometriosis. This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82071626), the Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project (LGF21H040010), and the Clinical Research project of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (1010293).

Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> This study evaluated the associations between inattention, impulsivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) across the menstrual cycle. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study enrolled 58 women with PMDD and 50 controls. Symptoms were assessed using the Attention and Performance Self-Assessment Scale and the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory during the pre-ovulatory (PO), mid-luteal (ML), and late luteal (LL) phases of the menstrual cycle. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The chi-square analysis revealed a significant association between ADHD and PMDD. Women with PMDD experienced a greater increase in scores of prospective everyday memory problems and difficulties maintaining focused attention from the PO phase to LL phase than the controls; in addition, they had higher scores in dysfunctional impulsivity during the LL phase than the controls. Among women in the PMDD group, those with ADHD had higher scores in prospective everyday memory problems and dysfunctional impulsivity during the PO and ML phases than those without ADHD. Women in the PMDD group without ADHD had a greater increase in scores of prospective everyday memory problems, difficulties maintaining focused attention, and dysfunctional impulsivity from the PO phase to the LL phase than the controls. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Our study demonstrated that women with PMDD were more likely to have comorbid ADHD and higher levels of inattention across the menstrual cycle. PMDD was associated with increased impulsivity during the LL phase, independent of ADHD, but it was not associated with a persistent elevation of impulsivity. Furthermore, PMDD women with comorbid ADHD experienced higher inattention and impulsivity during the PO and ML phases than those without it. Thus, ADHD comorbidity should be assessed when assessing or intervening in the symptoms of inattention and impulsivity in women with PMDD.",['Lin PC; Long CY; Ko CH; Yen JY'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38836765,58 women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder were diagnosed with ADHD. chi-square analysis revealed a significant association between ADHD and PMDD.
Skeletal effects following developmental flame-retardant exposure are specific to sex and chemical class in the adult Wistar rat.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Accumulating evidence reveals that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can disrupt aspects of metabolic programming, suggesting that skeletal development may be at risk, a possibility that is rarely examined. The commercial flame retardant (FR) mixture, Firemaster 550 (FM 550), has repeatedly been shown to negatively influence metabolic programming, raising concerns that skeletal integrity may consequently be impaired. We have previously shown that gestational and lactational exposure to 1,000 µg FM 550 negatively affected sex-specific skeletal traits in male, but not female, rats assessed at 6 months of age. Whether this outcome is primarily driven by the brominated (BFR) or organophosphate ester (OPFR) portions of the mixture or the effects persist to older ages is unknown. <b>Materials and methods:</b> To address this, in the present study, dams were orally exposed throughout gestation and lactation to either 1,000 μg BFR, 1,000 µg OPFR, or 2,000 µg FM 550. Offspring (<i>n</i> = 8/sex/exposure) were weaned at PND 21 and assessed for femoral cortical and trabecular bone parameters at 8 months of age by high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Serum levels of serotonin, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and calcium were quantified. <b>Results:</b> FM 550 affected both sexes, but the females were more appreciably impacted by the OPFRs, while the males were more vulnerable to the BFRs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Although sex specificity was expected due to the sexual dimorphic nature of skeletal physiology, the mechanisms accounting for the male- and female-specific phenotypes remain to be determined. Future work aims to clarify these unresolved issues.",['Schkoda S; Horman B; Witchey SK; Jansson A; Macari S; Patisaul HB'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37577032,"endocrine disrupting chemicals can disrupt metabolic programming. skeletal development may be at risk, a possibility rarely examined. dams were exposed throughout gestation and lactation to either 1,000 g BFR, 1,000 g OPFR, or 2,000 g FM 550."
Dynamic changes in AI-based analysis of endometrial cellular composition: Analysis of PCOS and RIF endometrium.,"The human endometrium undergoes a monthly cycle of tissue growth and degeneration. During the mid-secretory phase, the endometrium establishes an optimal niche for embryo implantation by regulating cellular composition (e.g., epithelial and stromal cells) and differentiation. Impaired endometrial development observed in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) contributes to infertility. Surprisingly, despite the importance of the endometrial lining properly developing prior to pregnancy, precise measures of endometrial cellular composition in these two infertility-associated conditions are entirely lacking. Additionally, current methods for measuring the epithelial and stromal area have limitations, including intra- and inter-observer variability and efficiency. We utilized a deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) model, created on a cloud-based platform and developed in our previous study. The AI model underwent training to segment both areas populated by epithelial and stromal endometrial cells. During the training step, a total of 28.36 mm2 areas were annotated, comprising 2.56 mm2 of epithelium and 24.87 mm2 of stroma. Two experienced pathologists validated the performance of the AI model. 73 endometrial samples from healthy control women were included in the sample set to establish cycle phase-dependent dynamics of the endometrial epithelial-to-stroma ratio from the proliferative (PE) to secretory (SE) phases. In addition, 91 samples from PCOS cases, accounting for the presence or absence of ovulation and representing all menstrual cycle phases, and 29 samples from RIF patients on day 5 after progesterone administration in the hormone replacement treatment cycle were also included and analyzed in terms of cellular composition. Our AI model exhibited reliable and reproducible performance in delineating epithelial and stromal compartments, achieving an accuracy of 92.40% and 99.23%, respectively. Moreover, the performance of the AI model was comparable to the pathologists' assessment, with F1 scores exceeding 82% for the epithelium and >96% for the stroma. Next, we compared the endometrial epithelial-to-stromal ratio during the menstrual cycle in women with PCOS and in relation to endometrial receptivity status in RIF patients. The ovulatory PCOS endometrium exhibited epithelial cell proportions similar to those of control and healthy women's samples in every cycle phase, from the PE to the late SE, correlating with progesterone levels (control SE, r2 = 0.64, FDR < 0.001; PCOS SE, r2 = 0.52, FDR < 0.001). The mid-SE endometrium showed the highest epithelial percentage compared to both the early and late SE endometrium in both healthy women and PCOS patients. Anovulatory PCOS cases showed epithelial cellular fractions comparable to those of PCOS cases in the PE (Anovulatory, 14.54%; PCOS PE, 15.56%, p = 1.00). We did not observe significant differences in the epithelial-to-stroma ratio in the hormone-induced endometrium in RIF patients with different receptivity statuses. The AI model rapidly and accurately identifies endometrial histology features by calculating areas occupied by epithelial and stromal cells. The AI model demonstrates changes in epithelial cellular proportions according to the menstrual cycle phase and reveals no changes in epithelial cellular proportions based on PCOS and RIF conditions. In conclusion, the AI model can potentially improve endometrial histology assessment by accelerating the analysis of the cellular composition of the tissue and by ensuring maximal objectivity for research and clinical purposes.",['Lee S; Arffman RK; Komsi EK; Lindgren O; Kemppainen J; Kask K; Saare M; Salumets A; Piltonen TT'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38445292,"the human endometrium undergoes a monthly cycle of tissue growth and degeneration. the endometrium establishes an optimal niche for embryo implantation. despite the importance of the endometrial lining properly developing prior to pregnancy, precise measures of endometrial cellular composition in these two infertility-associated conditions are entirely lacking."
Ovarian hormones reduce the negative association between worry and cognitive control: A combined neural and behavioral investigation.,"Increased reactivity to response conflict and errors, processes governed by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), have both been implicated in anxiety. Anxiety is also more common in females than males. Importantly, natural changes in ovarian hormones levels are related to fluctuations in anxiety symptoms in healthy and clinical populations, and ovarian hormones likely modulate prefrontal cortex structure and function. No studies, however, have examined the role of fluctuating ovarian hormones in the association between anxiety and cognitive control across the menstrual cycle. In this multimodal proof-of-concept study, naturally cycling females (N = 30 twins from 14 complete twin pairs and 2 participants whose co-twin was not in the final sample; age 18-29) provided saliva samples to assay for estradiol and progesterone and completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire for 35 consecutive days. At two time points, during projected pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory phases, they also completed the Flanker task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe cognitive control-related dACC activity. Multilevel modeling was used to examine within- and between-person effects of hormones and worry on cognitive-control indices. On days when estradiol and progesterone were low relative to a female's own average (i.e., within-subjects effect), worry was associated with greater flanker interference. In females with higher estradiol and progesterone levels compared to other females (i.e., between-subject effects), worry was associated with less error-related dACC activity, irrespective of the day that dACC activity was assessed. Findings suggest a protective effect of ovarian hormones on the link between worry and cognitive control. Associations between worry and conflict-monitoring were sensitive to daily hormonal fluctuations (within-person states), whereas associations between worry and error-monitoring were sensitive to mean hormone levels (between-person traits), suggesting that ovarian hormones are critical to consider in studies examining associations between anxiety and cognitive control in females.",['Russman Block SR; Klump KL; Beltz AM; Burt SA; Moser JS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38183865,hormones reduce negative association between anxiety and cognitive control. increased reactivity to response conflict and errors have both been implicated in anxiety. anxiety is also more common in females than males.
Local resource availability drives habitat use by a threatened avian granivore in savanna woodlands.,"Conserving threatened species relies on an understanding of their habitat requirements. This is especially relevant for granivorous birds, whose habitat use and movement patterns are intricately linked to the spatial and temporal availability of resources such as food and water. In this study, we investigated the habitat use, home range and daily activity patterns of the Endangered Southern Black-throated Finch (SBTF; Poephila cincta cincta) within a 75,000 ha savanna woodland study area in northeastern Australia. This semi-arid region is one of the key remaining strongholds for the species and is characterised by substantially different habitat and climatic conditions than areas where previous research on this species has been undertaken. We radio tracked 142 SBTF using both manual tracking and an array of 27 automated radio towers, which revealed a strong preference for eucalypt-dominated grassy woodland communities. The preference for these habitats also increased with decreasing distance to permanent water. While SBTF occupied large home ranges, individual SBTF were largely sedentary during the radio tracking period (21.8, range = 0.83-120 days), with few landscape-scale movements of more than 4.5 km. Daily foraging activity of SBTF exhibited bimodal peaks in the early morning and late afternoon, while other activities were greatest from the late morning to the early afternoon. Compared to other estrildid finches, our research suggests that SBTF track resources at a local scale across a large home range. We postulate that in times of resource scarcity SBTF may use dietary diversification, instead of landscape or regional-scale nomadic movements, to meet their resource needs. The species' movement patterns underscore the importance of local scale habitat management to facilitate resource availability throughout the year. Furthermore, our research helps target monitoring designs for granivorous birds that focus on the species' diurnal activity patterns.",['van Osta JM; Dreis B; Grogan LF; Castley JG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39110670,a threatened avian granivore is a threat to a granivore in savanna woodlands. local resource availability drives habitat use and home range. this is especially relevant for granivorous birds whose habitat use and movement patterns are intricately linked to the spatial and temporal availability of resources such as food and water.
The Relationship Between Mood and Sleep in Different Female Reproductive States.,"Mood and sleep are tightly interrelated. Mood and sleep symptoms and disorders are more common in women than in men and often associated with reproductive events. This article reviews the current literature on the reciprocal relationships between mood and sleep across reproductive phases in women, such as menstrual cycle and related disorders, pregnancy, climacteric, and use of hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy. Mood and sleep symptoms seem to covary in relation to physiologic and pathologic reproductive conditions, although the relationship seems more clear for subjective than objective sleep.",['Polo-Kantola P; Toffol E'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38501512,Mood and sleep symptoms are more common in women than in men.

"Husband responses towards birth preparedness, complications readiness, and associated factors in southern Ethiopia: the case of Kena District.","Birth preparedness and complication readiness is a holistic approach that empowers mothers and families with the knowledge, attitude, and resources to alleviate potential challenges during childbirth. Despite its benefits, husbands' participation in maternal care differs significantly between countries and regions. There is a lack of previous studies that look at husbands' responses to birth preparedness and complication readiness in the research area. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to find out how husbands who have wives with infants under 12 months old feel about birth preparation, readiness for problems, and its associated factors. A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from May 30 to July 29, 2022. Simple random sampling was employed to select 499 husbands. An interviewer-administered, structured, and pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data entry and analysis were performed using Epi Data version 4.6 and SPSS version 25, respectively. We used multivariable logistic regression to find statistically significant factors. P-values less than 0.05, 95% confidence intervals, and adjusted odds ratios are used to declare statistical significance. The findings were shown in figures, tables, and text. The study found that 55.9% (95% CI: 51.4 to 61.4%) of husbands responded to birth preparedness and complication readiness. This response was significantly associated with being employed (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 2.27-5.95), engaging in self-business (AOR = 5.3, 95% CI: 2.34-12.01), having wives who delivered in health facilities (AOR = 7.1, 95% CI: 3.92-12.86), accompanying wives for antenatal care (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.39-3.56), possessing good knowledge of danger signs during labor (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.08-3.74) and the postnatal period (AOR = 7.1, 95% CI: 3.14-16.01). Interestingly, residents living near a health facility (AOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.39-0.97) were less likely to respond. The present study found that nearly 6 out of 10 husbands actively responded in terms of birth preparedness and complication readiness. While husbands in this study showed some involvement in birth preparedness and complications, it is good when compared to studies carried out nationally. To improve this, educating husbands by focusing on the danger signs and their role in childbirth is recommended.",['Negesa Beyene B; Hirra KG; Gejo NG; Debela DE'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103952,"birth preparedness and complication readiness is a holistic approach that empowers mothers and families with the knowledge, attitude, and resources to alleviate potential challenges during childbirth. there is a lack of previous studies that look at husbands' responses to birth preparedness and complication readiness in the research area."
Benign and Malignant Outcomes in the Offspring of Females Exposed In Utero to Diethylstilbestrol (DES): An Update from the NCI Third Generation Study.,"Females exposed prenatally to diethylstilbestrol (DES) have an elevated risk of cervical dysplasia, breast cancer, and clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the cervix/vagina. Testicular cancer risk is increased in prenatally exposed males. Epigenetic changes may mediate the transmission of DES effects to the next (""third"") generation of offspring. Using data self-reported by third-generation females, we assessed DES in relation to the risk of cancer and benign breast and reproductive tract conditions. Using data from prenatally DES-exposed and unexposed mothers, we assessed DES in relation to cancer risk in their female and male offspring. Cancer risk was assessed by standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI); the risks of benign and malignant diagnoses were assessed by hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI. In self-reported data, DES exposure was not associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (HR 0.83; CI 0.36-1.90), breast cancer, or severe cervical dysplasia. No females reported CCA. The risk of borderline ovarian cancer appeared elevated, but the HR was imprecise (3.46; CI 0.37-32.42). Based on mothers' reports, DES exposure did not increase the risk of overall cancer (HR 0.80; CI 0.49-1.32) or of other cancers in third-generation females. Overall cancer risk in exposed males appeared elevated (HR 1.41; CI 0.70-2.86), but the CI was wide. The risk of testicular cancer was not elevated in exposed males; no cases of prostate cancer were reported. To date, there is little evidence that DES is associated with cancer risk in third-generation females or males, but these individuals are relatively young, and further follow-up is needed.",['Titus L; Hatch EE; Bertrand KA; Palmer JR; Strohsnitter WC; Huo D; Curry M; Hyer M; Aagaard K; Gierach GL; Troisi R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39061214,"females exposed prenatally to diethylstilbestrol have elevated risk of cervical dysplasia, breast cancer, and clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the cervix/vagina.

Endogenous Microbacteria Can Contribute to Ovarian Carcinogenesis by Reducing Iron Concentration in Cysts: A Pilot Study.,"Among epithelial ovarian cancer, clear cell carcinoma is common for chemo-resistance and high mortality. This cancer arises from benign ovarian endometrioma (OE), which is a high oxidative stress environment due to the cystic retention of menstrual blood produced during menstruation and the ""iron"" liberated from the cyst. There has been strong evidence that the iron concentration in OE decreases when they become cancerous. A decrease in iron concentration is a necessary condition for the formation of cancer. However, the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not yet clear. In the current study, the bacterial flora in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC), including clear cell carcinoma, and their origin, OE, were investigated using next-generation sequencing. The Shannon index in the genus level was significantly higher in EAOC than in OE fluids. Among several bacterial flora that were more abundant than benign chocolate cysts, a number of bacterial species that correlate very well with iron concentrations in the cysts were identified. These bacterial species are likely to be associated with decreased iron concentrations and cancer development.",['Kawahara N; Yamanaka S; Nishikawa K; Matsuoka M; Maehana T; Kawaguchi R; Ozu N; Fujii T; Sugimoto A; Yoshizawa A; Kimura F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38543589,"bacterial flora in ovarian cancer and their origin, OE, were investigated using next-generation sequencing. a number of bacterial species that correlate very well with iron concentrations in the cysts were identified."
The Role of Benson's and Mitchell's Relaxation Techniques in the Management of Premenstrual Syndrome: An In-Depth Review.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a menstrual disorder characterized by physical, behavioral, and emotional symptoms typically occurring during the luteal phase. These symptoms are usually mild and somatic and often subside during or just before the start of menstruation. Medical professionals employ pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments as the primary approach to managing PMS. One effective non-pharmacological method is Laura Mitchell's physiological relaxation treatment, which has been shown to enhance immunological function, reduce depression, and improve the overall quality of life. Another beneficial technique is Benson's relaxation technique, established by Herbert Benson in 1970, providing a simple yet powerful stress-release strategy. For this study, research papers were searched using various reputable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar websites, with data collected up to the end of 2021. The publication dates of the review articles were not restricted, allowing for a comprehensive overview. However, it is important to note that only a limited number of accessible studies have been found, underscoring the need for further research. Future investigations should focus on high-quality evidence with reliable outcome measures to draw more conclusive results about which relaxation technique offers better relief for PMS.",['Raipure A; Patil S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37736435,"premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a menstrual disorder characterized by physical, behavioral, and emotional symptoms typically occurring during the luteal phase. symptoms are usually mild and somatic and often subside during or just before the start of menstruation."
The Effects of Sex Hormones on Postoperative Pain in Patients with Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.,"There are many factors that affect postoperative pain. This study determines the effect of preoperative sex hormone levels on postoperative pain levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study included a total of 89 patients who met the study inclusion criteria. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on their sex and pre and postmenopausal periods: male patients (n = 28), postmenopausal female patients (n = 31), and female patients with normal cycles (n = 30). Normal-cycle women were also regrouped based on their follicular and luteal phases. Data were collected using a descriptive characteristics form, a patient follow-up form, and the Visual Analog Scale. Venous blood samples taken from the patients before surgery were used to measure their levels of estradiol (EST), testosterone (TES), and progesterone levels. Male patients had lower pain levels than female patients. The male patients' Visual Analog Scale scores were inversely related and correlated strongly with their TES levels ( P < 0.05). However, subgroup analyses suggested that their EST level played a primary role in males and that the EST/TES ratio was determinant in the late postoperative period. In female patients, the EST/progesterone ratio was the most determining factor for the level of pain felt in the postmenopausal period, whereas there was no change in the premenopausal period at different stages of the menstrual cycle. Sex hormones were found to be effective in predicting postoperative pain severity.",['Koraş Sözen K; Bolat H; Güntürk İ'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38241658,89 patients met inclusion criteria for postoperative pain. male patients had lower pain levels than female patients. male patients had lower pain levels than female patients.
Experiences of menstrual inequity and menstrual health among women and people who menstruate in the Barcelona area (Spain): a qualitative study.,"Menstrual health and menstrual inequity have been neglected in social, economic, healthcare and political spheres. Although available evidence is scarce, it already suggests a link between experiencing menstrual inequity (which refers to the systematic disparities in accessing menstrual health and education, menstrual products and spaces for menstrual management, among other aspects) and menstrual health outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of menstrual health and menstrual inequity among women and people who menstruate aged 18-55 in Barcelona and surrounding areas (Spain). A qualitative study, using a critical feminist perspective, was conducted. Sampling was purposeful and selective. Recruitment was through sexual and reproductive health centres, social media and snowball sampling techniques. Thirty-four semi-structured photo-elicitation interviews were conducted between December 2020 and February 2021. Interviews took place in sexual and reproductive health centres, public spaces, and by telephone. Data were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Three themes were identified: ""Systemic neglect of menstruation and the menstrual cycle"", ""When ""the private"" becomes public: menstrual management"" and ""Navigating menstrual health: between medicalization and agency"". Experiences of menstrual inequity appeared to be widespread among participants. They referred to the impact of having to conceal menstruation and the barriers to managing menstruation in public spaces. Choosing menstrual products was often influenced by price and availability; several participants reported menstrual poverty. A general lack of menstrual education was described. Menstrual education was usually gained through personal experience and self-learnings, or through families and friends. Menstruation and the menstrual cycle had a significant impact on participants' day-to-day. Accessing and navigating the healthcare system was challenging, as participants mostly reported feeling dismissed and almost exclusively offered hormonal contraception as a panacea to address menstrual health. The impact of menstrual inequity appears to be far-reaching. Multidimensional structural policies should promote agency in individuals and communities to enable opportunities for menstrual education, access to menstrual products, healthcare services and adequate menstrual-management facilities. Health professionals' training is also necessary to improve access to and quality of menstrual healthcare. Policies need to be inclusive of non-binary and trans people, and vulnerable populations.",['Holst AS; Jacques-Aviñó C; Berenguera A; Pinzón-Sanabria D; Valls-Llobet C; Munrós-Feliu J; Martínez-Bueno C; López-Jiménez T; Vicente-Hernández MM; Medina-Perucha L'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35183195,"menstrual health and menstrual inequity have been neglected in social, economic, healthcare and political spheres. a qualitative study was conducted using a critical feminist perspective. a qualitative study was conducted to explore experiences of menstrual health and menstrual inequity among women and people who menstruate aged 18-55 in the area (spain)"
Can period-related symptoms predict menstrual manipulation among Australian female cyclists?,"This study explored the extent of menstrual manipulation and its associated impact on period-related symptoms and training disruptions in Australian Female Cyclists. 205 female cyclists, from recreational to elite level, participated in an online ""Female Cyclist Questionnaire (FCQ)"". The FCQ utilised a series of validated questionnaires to obtain demographic information and menstrual function of the respondents, and to investigate their menstrual manipulation habits and perceptions on how their period-related symptoms affected their well-being, mood, energy and training tolerance. More than 80% of the cyclists reported that their period-related symptoms impacted upon training and 41% made training adjustments based on these symptoms. Two-thirds of respondents thought their training should be phase-controlled yet only half discussed their hormonal cycles with their coaches. Menstrual manipulation was predicted by reduced ""workout tolerance"" in these cyclists (odds ratio = 0.632). Half of the respondents reported compromised ability to tolerate high-intensity interval training with period-related symptoms. Period pain, increased irritability, lower energy levels and more sugar cravings were commonly reported but did not predict menstrual manipulation. The data indicated that period-related symptoms are present in Australian female cyclists across all levels of participation. However, the perceived impact to training and subsequent behavioural changes varied among individuals.",['Lee SJL; Peiffer JJ; Haakonssen E; Van Rens FECA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38590213,"205 female cyclists participated in an online ""Female Cyclist Questionnaire"" the study examined the extent of menstrual manipulation and its associated impact on training disruptions. the findings were based on a series of validated questionnaires."
Phase III long-term study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate in Japanese patients with uterine fibroids.,"To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term intermittent administration of 10-mg ulipristal acetate (UPA) for symptomatic uterine fibroids in Japanese women. Open-label, noncomparative study (Japan Primary Registries Network identifier: JapicCTI-173737) conducted at 32 gynecological centers (November 2017-December 2019). Premenopausal women diagnosed with uterine fibroids associated with heavy menstrual bleeding received three 12-week courses of 10-mg UPA once daily. Amenorrhea, fibroid volume, endometrial histology, and safety were assessed. Of 155 patients enrolled, 140 received ≥1 dose of UPA and were analyzed. Across all courses, the rates of patients with amenorrhea for 35 days were >90%, and >99% of patients achieved uterine bleeding normalization. Median time to amenorrhea after each course started was 4-5 days; menstruation returned after treatment within a median of 25-27 days. Mean changes in fibroid volume from baseline were -21.5%, -31.4%, and -35.0% for Courses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Patients experienced sustained improvements in anemia, pain, and quality of life during treatment. Most adverse events were mild/moderate in severity and decreased in frequency with each course. Seven serious adverse events (six patients) were reported; anemia, embolic cerebral infarction, and pituitary apoplexy (one patient each) were considered UPA-related. Nonphysiological changes in endometrial histology were transient and benign. No safety concerns were detected in hormone concentrations or liver function tests. Long-term administration of 10-mg UPA is effective for reducing symptoms associated with uterine fibroids in Japanese women. UPA was well tolerated and few safety concerns were reported.",['Osuga Y; Nakano Y; Yamauchi Y; Murakawa H'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34109697,u.s. women with uterine fibroids received three 12-week courses of 10-mg UPA once daily. u.s. women with uterine fibroids were treated with a fibroid volume of 1-2 mg.
"Quantitative risk-benefit profiles of oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizers and antiandrogens for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A model-based meta-analysis.","Oral contraceptives (OCs), insulin sensitizers, and antiandrogens (AAs), alone or in combination, are commonly used for treating non-fertility indications in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, unclear risk-benefit profiles jeopardize their appropriate clinical applications. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the effects of the aforementioned medications and to compare their risk-benefit profiles. Randomized controlled trials published until 14th March 2022 were searched in PubMed and Embase. A model-based meta-analysis was developed to examine the time-effect profiles of each medication. The maximal percentage change of the effect (E<sub>max</sub>) and time to achieve half of E<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>50</sub>) were estimated. Primary outcomes included menstruation, hirsutism score, free androgen index (FAI), body mass index (BMI), insulin sensitivity, and lipid profiles. Overall, 200 studies (9,685 patients and 385 arms) were identified for modeling. OCs performed exceptionally well in improving menstruation (E<sub>max</sub>: 149%; T<sub>50</sub>: 7.44 weeks), hirsutism score (E<sub>max</sub>: 66.2%; T<sub>50</sub>: 26.2 weeks), and FAI (E<sub>max</sub>: 75.7%; T<sub>50</sub>: 0.51 weeks). However, OCs elevated the triglyceride (TG) level (E<sub>max</sub>: 12.6%; T<sub>50</sub>:1.19 weeks). After 12-week OC treatment, the TG level of approximately 30% of patients, whose baselines were normal, exceeded the reference limit. This suggested that OC-induced dyslipidemia should be routinely monitored. The maximal BMI-lowering effect of metformin was similar to that of placebo (E<sub>max</sub>: 3.80%); however, metformin had a shorter T<sub>50</sub> (6.67 weeks versus 12.9 weeks). Further, active lifestyle intervention plus placebo significantly decreased BMI (E<sub>max</sub>: 8.78%). Adding metformin to active lifestyle intervention accelerated the BMI-lowering effect within 24 weeks, whereas with the extension of this addition beyond 24 weeks, BMI did not reduce further, which indicated that benefits were limited from this prolonged addition. AAs were less potent in reducing hirsutism score (E<sub>max</sub>: 40.2% versus 66.2%) and FAI (E<sub>max</sub>: 34.5% versus 75.7%) compared to OCs. OC plus metformin combined OC-derived androgen-suppressing effects and metformin-derived insulin-sensitizing effects, and partially relieved the OC-induced TG increase (E<sub>max</sub>: 9.76%). Baseline dependency was found in most clinical responses, implying that pharmacotherapies tailored based on baselines achieved more clinical improvements. This study presents new quantitative evidence on pharmacotherapies for PCOS. Currently, long-term risk-benefit profiles and emerging therapies are inadequately reported and require more further research.",['Tang Z; Guan J; Mao JH; Han L; Zhang JJ; Chen R; Jiao Z'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37666459,"oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizers, and antiandrogens are commonly used for treating non-fertility indications in polycystic ovary syndrome. unclear risk-benefit profiles jeopardize appropriate clinical applications."
Usefulness of the Sympto-Thermal Method with Standardized Cervical Mucus Assessment (InVivo Method) for Evaluating the Monthly Cycle in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).,"(1) Background: FABMs (fertility awareness-based methods) are methods that rely on the observation of clinical signs related to fertility found in women, the so-called fertility bioindicators. They can be a valuable tool for diagnosing monthly cycle disorders and infertility, for example, among patients with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Until now, it has been difficult for women with PCOS to use FABM, due to the difficulty of describing fertility bioindicators and their disorders due to the biology of the syndrome. The new InVivo sympto-thermal method with standardized cervical mucus assessment may provide a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool for observing the monthly cycle in this group of women. (2) Methods: The monthly cycle was evaluated in a group of 32 women of reproductive age. A total of 108 monthly cycle observation cards were analyzed: 35 monthly cycle cards were collected from 18 women with PCOS, and 73 monthly cycle cards collected from 14 healthy women. In addition, 32 pairs of macroscopic and microscopic images were evaluated: 17 pairs from the study group (four subjects) and 15 pairs from women in the control group (six subjects). (3) Results: We showed that in the group of patients with PCOS, menstruation was longer (<i>p</i> = 0.000814), the number of mucus peaks was statistically higher (<i>p</i> = 0.040747), and the interquartile range (IQR) of the duration of the follicular phase (calculated according to the BBT) was significantly higher (8 days) compared to women in the control group. We also observed that among all the women studied, the microscopic image of cervical mucus correlated with the cycle phase described in the observation card, as determined by reference to the BBT chart, provided that it showed the correct features. (4) Conclusions: Systematic maintenance of monthly cycle observation charts using the InVivo method can be an important supplement to the medical history, as it allows for a thorough assessment of, among others, the timing of monthly bleeding, cervical mucus symptoms, BBT changes, and the duration of the follicular and luteal phases among both healthy and PCOS women.",['Stachowska A; Kicińska AM; Kotulak-Chrząszcz A; Babińska A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38891183,the invivo method with standardized cervical mucus assessment may provide a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool for observing the monthly cycle in this group of women. the method is used to evaluate the monthly cycle in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Risk factors of chronic endometritis in women who have undergone hysteroscopy: a prospective nested case-control study.,"There is limited research on risk factors for chronic endometritis regarding reproductive history and clinical symptoms. Thus, this nested case-control study identified risk factors for chronic endometritis in women who have undergone hysteroscopy. Endometrial tissue sections were obtained from 502 women with intrauterine disorders who underwent hysteroscopy. Chronic endometritis was diagnosed via CD138 immunostaining. The women were divided into two groups: 271 women without chronic endometritis and 231 women with chronic endometritis. The prevalence of chronic endometritis was 46%. Univariate logistic regression revealed that prolonged menstruation and intermenstrual bleeding were associated with chronic endometritis, and subsequent multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that these were further independently associated. With univariable logistic regression, the gravidity and abortion history were correlated with chronic endometritis; however, no significant correlation was found with the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.19) or 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-1.11), respectively. No significant correlation was found between caesarean section history and the rates of chronic endometritis. No significant difference was found in all other variables between the three groups with > 5, ≤ 5 plasma cells and in a unknown group. Prolonged menstruation and intermenstrual bleeding were risk factors associated with chronic endometritis. Chronic endometritis should be considered and CD138 immunohistochemical examination should be recommended in women with these symptoms.",['Gao Y; Xu G; Yang M; Chen K; Wang Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103391,nested case-control study identified risk factors for chronic endometritis in women who have undergone hysteroscopy. endometrial tissue sections were obtained from 502 women with intrauterine disorders who underwent hysteroscopy. chronic endometritis was diagnosed via CD138 immunostaining.
Saliva as a Diagnostic Tool for Early Detection of Exercise-Induced Oxidative Damage in Female Athletes.,"Although blood still remains the most commonly utilized medium to detect increased levels of oxidative damage induced by exercise, saliva diagnostics have gained increasing popularity due to their non-invasive nature and athlete-friendly collection process. Given that the contribution of various phases of the menstrual cycle to the levels of oxidative damage may differ, the aim of this study was to evaluate an agreement between salivary and plasmatic levels of lipid peroxidation products in female swimmers in both the follicular (F) and luteal (L) phases of the menstrual cycle at rest and following exercise. Twelve well-trained female swimmers aged 19.6 ± 1.1 years old were examined. We measured diene conjugates (DCs), triene conjugates (TCs), and Schiff bases (SBs) in lipids immediately after their extraction from both saliva and blood plasma. All female swimmers were studied two times each, in the two different phases of one menstrual cycle, before and after high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Salivary and plasmatic levels of DCs, TCs, and SBs significantly increased post-exercise compared to pre-exercise, in both the F and L phases. A high positive correlation was observed between the concentrations of DCs, TCs, and SBs in the saliva and blood plasma of participants in the F and L phases, both at rest and following HIIE. Ordinary least products regression analysis indicates that there was no proportional and differential bias in the data. The Bland-Altman method also declares that there was no differential bias, since the line of equality was within the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference between salivary and plasmatic levels of DCs, TCs, and SBs in female swimmers, in both the F and L phases, before and after HIIE. There was also no proportional bias in the Bland-Altman plots.

Abnormal amino acid synthesis and glutathione metabolism may affect PCOS blastocyst development: an examination of in vitro mouse blastocysts model utilizing RNA-sequencing.,"Extensive research has been conducted on embryonic developmental disorders linked to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a pathological condition that affects 5-10% of women and is characterized by irregularities in the menstrual cycle and infertility. By employing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we performed an in-depth investigation of PCOS-related changes in gene expression patterns at the mouse blastocyst stage. The zygotes of female B6D2 mice were obtained and then differentiated into blastocysts in K + Simplex Optimised Medium (KSOM) cultures containing exo-NC (negative control for exosomes) or exo-LIPE-AS1 (a novel exosomal marker of PCOS). Subsequently, blastocysts were collected for RNA-seq. The bioinformatics was performed to analyze and compare the differences of gene expression profile between blastocysts of control and PCOS group. There were 1150 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups of mouse blastocysts; 243 genes were upregulated and 907 downregulated in the blastocysts of the exo-LIPE-AS1 group compared to those of the exo-NC group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the genes involved in amino acid synthesis and glutathione metabolic pathways were down-regulated in exo-LIPE-AS1 group. This study has revealed that blastocyst developmental retardation may be associated with the downregulation of amino acid synthesis and glutathione metabolism, which may affect energy metabolism, biosynthesis, cellular osmotic pressure, antioxidant synthesis, ROS clearance or mitochondrial function, and ultimately cause blastocyst cell development abnormalities. Our research offers encouraging data on the mechanisms underlying aberrant embryonic development in patients with PCOS as well as potential treatment strategies.",['Wang C; Yu L; Cai W; Liu T; Liu M; Che Q; Tang J; Wang X; Dong X; Pan B; Wang B; Liu S; Guo W'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39107770,RNA sequencing was used to investigate PCOS-related changes in gene expression patterns at the mouse blastocyst stage. the zygotes of female B6D2 mice were obtained and then differentiated into blastocysts in K + Simplex Optimised Medium (KSOM) cultures containing exo-NC or exo-LIPE-AS1 were collected for RNA-seq.
"Circadian regulation of locomotion, respiration, and arousability in adult blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis).","The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is an ectoparasitic arachnid and vector for infectious diseases, including Lyme borreliosis. Here, we investigate the diurnal activity and respiration of wild-caught and lab-reared adult ticks with long-term video recording, multi-animal tracking and high-resolution respirometry. We find male and female ticks are in a more active, more arousable state during circadian night. We find respiration is augmented by light, with dark onset triggering more frequent bouts of discontinuous gas exchange and a higher overall volume of CO<sub>2</sub> respired. Observed inactivity during the day meets the criteria of sleep: homeostatic in nature, rapidly reversible, a characteristic pose, and reduced arousal threshold. Our findings indicate that blacklegged ticks are in a distinct, heightened state of activity and arousability during night and in dark, suggesting this period may carry higher risk for tick bites and subsequent contraction of tick-borne diseases.",['Marshall JP; Marinko E; To A; Morejon JL; Joshi R; Shea J; Gibbs AG; Meiselman MR'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38926516,"blacklegged ticks are in a distinct, heightened state of activity and arousability during night and in dark. blacklegged ticks are an ectoparasitic arachnid and vector for infectious diseases."
Diagnosing and managing common genital emergencies in pediatric girls.,"The presentation of genital injuries and emergencies in pediatric girls can sometimes be misleading. A traumatic injury with excessive bleeding may be a straddle injury that requires only conservative management, while a penetrating injury may have no recognizable signs or symptoms but require extensive surgery. This issue reviews the most common traumatic genital injuries in girls presenting to the emergency department, including straddle injuries, hematomas, and impalement injuries. Nontraumatic emergencies, including hematocolpos and urethral prolapse, are also discussed.

Quantitative ultrasound measurement of uterine contractility in adenomyotic vs. normal uteri: a multicenter prospective study.,"To evaluate uterine contractility in patients with adenomyosis compared with healthy controls using a quantitative two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) speckle tracking method. A multicenter prospective observational study took place in three European centers between 2014 and 2023. One university teaching hospital, 1 teaching hospital and 1 specialised clinic. A total of 46 women with a sonographic or magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of adenomyosis were included. 106 healthy controls without uterine pathologies were included. Four-minute TVUS recordings were performed and four uterine contractility features were extracted using a speckle tracking algorithm. The extracted features were contraction frequency (contractions/min), amplitude, velocity (mm/s), and coordination. Women with adenomyosis were compared with healthy controls according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. Throughout the different phases of the menstrual cycle, trends of increased amplitude, decreased frequency and velocity, and reduced contraction coordination were seen in patients with adenomyosis compared with healthy controls. These were statistically significant in the late follicular phase, with a higher amplitude (0.087 ± 0.042 vs. 0.050 ± 0.018), lower frequency and velocity (1.49 ± 0.22 vs. 1.68 ± 0.25 contractions/min, and 0.65 ± 0.18 vs. 0.88 ± 0.29 mm/s, respectively), and reduced contraction coordination (0.34 ± 0.08 vs. 0.26 ± 0.17), in the late luteal phase, with higher amplitude (0.050 ± 0.022 vs. 0.035 ± 0.013), lower velocity (0.51 ± 0.11 vs. 0.65 ± 0.13 mm/s), and reduced contraction coordination (0.027 ± 0.06 vs. 0.18 ± 0.07), and in the midfollicular phase, with decreased frequency (1.48 ± 0.21 vs. 1.69 ± 0.16 contractions/min) in patients with adenomyosis compared with healthy controls. During menses, a higher pain score was significantly associated with lower frequency and velocity and higher contraction amplitude. Results remained significant after correcting for age, parity, and body mass index. Uterine contractility differs in patients with adenomyosis compared with healthy controls throughout the phases of the menstrual cycle. This suggests an etiologic mechanism for the infertility and dysmenorrhea seen in patients with adenomyosis. Moreover, it presents new potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.",['Rees CO; Thomas S; de Boer A; Huang Y; Zizolfi B; Foreste V; di Spiezio di Sardo A; Christoforidis N; van Vliet HAAM; Mischi M; Schoot BC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38199285,prospective study compared uterine contractility in patients with adenomyosis. 106 healthy controls without uterine pathologies included. adenomyotic women were compared with healthy controls according to the phase of the menstrual cycle.
A Survey of Female-Specific Cardiovascular Protocols in Emergency Departments in Canada.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death for women. However, systematic inequalities exist in how women experience clinical cardiovascular (CV) policies, programs, and initiatives. In collaboration with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, a question regarding female-specific CV protocols in an emergency department (ED), or an inpatient or ambulatory care area of a healthcare site was sent via e-mail to 450 healthcare sites in Canada. Contacts at these sites were established through the larger initiative-the Heart Failure Resources and Services Inventory-conducted by the foundation. Responses were received from 282 healthcare sites, with 3 sites confirming the use of a component of a female-specific CV protocol in the ED. Three sites noted using sex-specific troponin levels in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes; 2 of the sites are participants in the hs-<b>c</b>Tn-<b>O</b>ptimizing the <b>D</b>iagnosis of Acut<b>e M</b>yocardial <b>I</b>nfarction/Injury in Women (CODE MI) trial. One site reported the integration of a female-specific CV protocol component into routine use. We have identified an absence of female-specific CVD protocols in EDs that may be associated with the identified poorer outcomes in women impacted by CVD. Female-specific CV protocols may serve to increase equity and ensure that women with CV concerns have access to the appropriate care in a timely manner, thereby helping to mitigate some of the current adverse effects experienced by women who present to Canadian EDs with CV symptoms.",['Tegg NL; Desmarais OH; Lindsay MP; McDermott S; Mulvagh SL; Desbiens MM; Norris CM'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36880067,a survey of female-specific CV protocols in emergency departments in canada. a question was sent via e-mail to 450 healthcare sites. the heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada has partnered with the heart and Stroke Foundation.
Menstrual experience of adolescents in the USA: protocol for a scoping review.,"In recent years, there has been a growing desire to address issues related to menstruation, particularly for adolescent girls. In low-income and middle-income countries, prior literature review of the adolescent menstrual experience suggests the need for further research into the impact and efficacy of interventions with this population. There is evidence to suggest the need for initiatives and research in higher-income countries like the USA. To date, the body of research on adolescent menstrual experience in the USA remains uncharacterised. Therefore, we propose a scoping review of the literature on this subject to better inform on areas for future primary study. Using the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and expounded on by Levac <i>et al</i> and the Joanna Briggs Institute, we will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ProQuest Public Health Database, Social Science Citation Index, Social Services Abstracts and SocINDEX) and grey literature for relevant studies in consultation with experienced librarians. The abstracts and full-text from each reference will be screened by two independent reviewers for inclusion. Bibliographic data, study characteristics and themes will be extracted from studies selected for inclusion using a rubric created by the research team. Findings will be summarised and a list of subject areas for future primary research will be generated in consultation with stakeholders. The review will be conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items from Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Formal ethics training for this study is not required, as the research team will review publicly available studies. Stakeholders working in adolescent and menstrual health were consulted in designing this review. We will share key findings with stakeholders and in scholarly journals at the conclusion of the review.",['Olowojesiku R; Shim DJ; Moppins B; Park D; Patterson JO; Schoenl SA; Gaines JK; Sperr EV; Baldwin A'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602701,literature review of menstrual experience in the u.s. suggests need for research. research on adolescent menstrual experience in the u.s. remains uncharacterised.
"Premenstrual Syndrome, Anxiety, and Depression Among Menstruating Rural Adolescent Girls: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.","Introduction Menstrual periods in young females can add a new challenge to the already difficult adolescent transition period. Menstrual health concerns can have extreme physical and psychosocial impacts on adolescent girls. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are extremely common yet underestimated. Depression in adolescents is a mental and emotional disorder. The objective of the study was to find out the prevalence of PMS, PMDD, anxiety, and depression among rural menstruating adolescent girls and the factors associated with it. Methods This was a community-based cross-sectional study carried out among 20 rural schools for the period of one year. Sample size was calculated based on previous research. Adolescent females who had menstruated for one year were included and those with primary amenorrhea and previously diagnosed mental health abnormalities were excluded. Becks' Depression Inventory, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST-A) were used. Data were collected by interview technique and entered in an Excel sheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States), and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (Released 2013; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results Out of 430 rural adolescent girls, 180 (41.9%) were 15 years, 277 (64.4%) belonged to nuclear families, 236 (54.9%) exercised less than 30 minutes, 144 (33.5%) had menarche at the age of 13 years, 288 (67%) had regular cycles, 266 (61.9%) had moderate flow during the menstrual cycle, 302 (70.2%) had a flow duration of less than seven days, and 243 (56.5%) had dysmenorrhea. Thirty-eight (8.8%) girls had PMDD and 75 (17.4%) had PMS. Age, family status, severity of menstrual flow, duration of cycle, and presence of dysmenorrhea, depression, and anxiety had a statistically significant association with PMDD. The class/grade in which studying, cycle regularity, flow during the menstrual cycle, duration of the cycle, dysmenorrhea, anxiety, and depression status had a statistically significant association with PMS. Conclusions The menstrual cycle's impact on the mental health of rural adolescent girls should not be ignored and schools can be instrumental in improving their quality of life. Regular counselling and mental health supervision by school teachers and peer groups can be beneficial.",['Mann P; Ts P'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38213363,menstrual periods in young females can add a new challenge to the already difficult adolescent transition period. premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are extremely common yet underestimated.
"Falloposcopic tuboplasty: an easy, quick, and safe technique.","To describe our simplified technique for falloposcopic tuboplasty (FT) and demonstrate its principle and results. A step-by-step description of the technique and demonstration of its principle using a clay model. Private infertility clinics in Osaka and Tokyo operated by 10 physicians. A total of 431 infertile women with a diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral proximal tubal occlusion (6 cm from the uterotubal ostia), between October 2013 and February 2019 were included. These patients underwent routine work-ups for infertility, including a semen analysis, hysterosalpingography, antimüllerian hormone, basal luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin concentrations during menstruation, postcoital test in the periovulatory period, and estradiol and progesterone concentrations in the middle of the luteal phase. Physicians performed hysterosalpingography to evaluate tubal patency and uterine shape. Saline infusion sonography was not conducted because it does not accurately identify regions of tubal occlusion and/or stenosis. The principle of our simplified technique for FT is that a hole is located at the side of the FT catheter tip. Therefore, the balloon and fiberscope move away from the catheter line (Fig. 1). The uterotubal ostium is located at the tip-end of the triangle of the uterine cavity. When a balloon is inserted while visualizing the uterotubal ostium at the nearest position to the ostium, the balloon hits the uterine wall. When a balloon is inserted 5-10 mm from the uterotubal ostium without visualization, the balloon may be easily placed in the ostium through its convex angle, allowing it to slide into the uterine wall (Figs. 2 and 3). Step 1: Confirm anteflexion or retroflexion of the uterus by ultrasound. Step 2: Confirm the direction of the uterotubal ostia by hysteroscopy. Step 3: Adjust the angle of the FT catheter according to steps 1 and 2, insert the catheter into the end of the uterus, pull it back 5-10 mm (without visualizing the uterotubal ostia), and then fix it to the forceps. Catheter placement away from the tubal ostium is confirmed by the residual length of the moving part of the catheter. An attending instructor should ask the operator about the feeling of rigidity when the catheter does not advance and then suggest whether to proceed or stop. In the latter case, the catheter is not moved, saline is infused for 1 minute for lubrication, the balloon is pulled back using the fiberscope to remove the bunching of the balloon, and balloon pressure is changed as follows: 6→8→6→10→6 mmHg. Our institutional review board stated that approval was not required because the video describes the technique of our routine procedure. A description of the FT technique using a clay model and a demonstration of its application in our clinic. The average operative time was 15.4 minutes, and the clinical pregnancy rate was 24.4% (natural conception and intrauterine insemination without in vitro fertilization). No significant differences were observed in the operative time or pregnancy rate among physicians. Approximately 17 FT procedures may be performed using one fiberscope. Our simplified technique, which was described and demonstrated in this video article, is a feasible and practical approach for performing FT. It provides excellent cost performance by saving fiberscopes. The most important point is ""Introduce the balloon and fiberscope 5-10 mm away from the uterotubal ostia without visualizing it."" To facilitate learning this technique, we recommend watching the video and then practicing FT without searching for the uterotubal ostia. Physicians master FT without any assistance by an attending instructor in ≤3 attempts.",['Matsubayashi H; Takaya Y; Takeuchi T; Doshida M; Ohara Y; Ishikawa T'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34535295,"a total of 431 infertile women with a diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral proximal tubal occlusion (6 cm from the uterotubal ostia) between October 2013 and February 2019 were included. a semen analysis, hysterosalpingography, antimüllerian hormone, basal luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin concentrations during menstruation were included."

Progestin-only contraception: injectables and implants.,"Progestin-only contraceptive injectables and implants are highly effective, longer-acting contraceptive methods that can be used by most women in most circumstances. Globally, 6% of women using modern contraception use injectables and 1% use implants. Injectables are the predominant contraceptive method used in sub-Saharan Africa, and account for 43% of modern contraceptive methods used. A lower-dose, subcutaneous formulation of the most widely used injectable, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, has been developed. Implants have the highest effectiveness of any contraceptive method. Commodity cost, which historically limited implant availability in low-resource countries, was markedly lowered between 2012 and 2013. Changes in menstrual bleeding patterns are extremely common with both methods, and a main cause of discontinuation. Advice from normative bodies differs on progestin-only contraceptive use by breastfeeding women 0-6 weeks postpartum. Whether these methods are associated with HIV acquisition is a controversial issue, with important implications for sub-Saharan Africa, which has a disproportionate burden of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and maternal mortality.",['Jacobstein R; Polis CB'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24996766,6% of women using modern contraception use injectables and 1% use implants. injectables are the predominant contraceptive method used in sub-saharan africa.
Effects of Oral Contraceptive Androgenicity on Visuospatial and Social-Emotional Cognition: A Prospective Observational Trial.,"Oral contraceptives (OCs) containing estrogen and progesterone analogues are widely used amongst reproductive-aged women, but their neurocognitive impact is poorly understood. Preliminary studies suggest that OCs improve verbal memory and that OCs with greater androgenic activity may improve visuospatial ability. We sought to explore the cognitive impact of OCs by assessing performance of OC users at different stages of the OC cycle, and comparing this performance between users of different OC formulations according to known androgenic activity. We conducted a prospective, observational trial of OC users, evaluating cognitive performance with CogState software on two occasions: days 7-10 of active hormonal pill phase, and days 3-5 of the inactive pill phase (coinciding with the withdrawal bleed resembling menstruation). Thirty-five OC users (18 taking androgenic formulations, 17 taking anti-androgenic) were assessed. Analysis by androgenic activity showed superior performance by users of androgenic OCs, as compared to anti-androgenic OCs, in visuospatial ability and facial affect discrimination tasks. A growing understanding of cognitive effects of OC progestin androgenicity may have implications in choice of OC formulation for individuals and in future OC development.",['Gurvich C; Warren AM; Worsley R; Hudaib AR; Thomas N; Kulkarni J'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32218215,OCs containing estrogen and progesterone analogues are widely used among reproductive-aged women. preliminary studies suggest that OCs with greater androgenic activity may improve visuospatial ability.
"[Clinical effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation combined with nutritional support and psychological intervention in patients with ""Tetralogy of Tongji""].","<b>Objective:</b> To summarize and analyze the clinical effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with nutritional support and psychotherapy in patients with ""Tetralogy of Tongji"" (comprising chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, mental and psychological disorders, malnutrition, and endocrine disorders). <b>Methods:</b> A longitudinal study was conducted. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients were under 70 years of age; (2) patients exhibited chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction (in accordance with the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome ie. chronic functional constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain and abdominal distention) with onset occurring more than one year previously; (3) patients exhibited malnutrition (body mass index ≤ 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); (4) patients exhibited depression, anxiety, or state as diagnosed by a psychologist using the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) and the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD); (5) patients were women of childbearing age with amenorrhea or menstrual disorder with a duration ≥6 months. Patients were excluded if they exhibited gastrointestinal bleeding, short bowel syndrome, radiation-induced intestinal injury, intestinal obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease, recurrent/metastatic tumors, systemic infectious diseases, life-threatening systemic comorbidities, intorlerate to nasojejunal, percutaneous gastrostomy / jejunostomy or FMT. The clinical data of 43 patients at Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital exhibiting the ""Tetralogy of Tongji"" and who received microflora transplantation combined with nutritional support and psychotherapy from June 2017 to June 2021 was prospectively collected. There were 12 males and 31 females with a mean age of 35.2±16.7 years. All 43 patients had chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. Of these, 24 patients had depression and 19 had anxiety. There were 26 women of reproductive age, including 13 cases of menstrual disorder and 9 cases of amenorrhea. The treatment intervention was a combination of FMT (microflora solution or microflora capsule), nutritional support (enteral nutrition) and psychological intervention. The following were assessed before treatment and 1, 3, 6 months after treatment: (1) gastrointestinal function was assessed using the gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale (GSRS), where a higher score is indicative of more serious gastrointestinal symptoms, and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI), where a higher score is indicative of higher quality of life; (2) psychological status was assessed using HAMA and HAMD scores, where a lower score is indicative of reduced severity of anxiety or depression symptoms, respectively; (3) nutritional status was assessed by measurements of total blood protein, albumin, fibrinogen and prealbumin, as well as measurements of body mass and body mass index (BMI); (4) neuroendocrine function was assessed by measurement of blood levels of cortisol, dopamine and noradrenaline, as well as menstruation in women of reproductive age. <b>Results:</b> The follow-up rates at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment were 90.7% (39/43), 72.1% (31/43) and 55.8% (24/43), respectively. The total effective rate for chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction was 81.4% (35/43), of which the average GSRS score decreased from 29.35±3.56 before treatment to 18.25±2.56 in the sixth month (<i>P</i><0.001). The average GIQLI score increased from 56.23±10.34 before treatment to 91.04±20.39 in the sixth month (<i>P</i><0.001). All patients had malnutrition before treatment. After 6 months, their body weight had increased from 40.61±8.88 kg to 50.45±6.23 kg (<i>P</i><0.001), and BMI had increased from 15.17±1.87 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 19.58±1.42 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<i>P</i><0.001).

"Effect of Puberty, Menstruation, Pregnancy, Lactation, and Menopause on Chronic Urticaria Activity.","Chronic urticaria (CU) is a systemic disorder which is characterized by recurrent wheals and/or angioedema lasting more than 6 weeks. Sex hormones have been suggested to play a role in CU pathogenesis, however, their clinical implications have not been adequately described in the literature. To determine whether conditions that change sex hormone levels such as puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause affect the course of CU. This cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted on female CU patients at Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital UCARE Center between 2016 and 2017. The open-ended questionnaire consisted of questions evaluating the effects of hormonal changes on disease course. A total of 111 female CU patients were included in the analysis. During the perimenstrual period, CU symptoms worsened in 29% of patients but improved in 4.8%. The disease course did not change in the majority of patients during puberty, pregnancy, lactation, or menopause (100%, 96%, 83.8%, and 95.6%, respectively). Contrary to expectations, a change in sex hormone levels had no effect on the course of CU in the majority of cases.

The management of menstrual suppression and uterine bleeding: a survey of current practices in the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium.,"Current guidelines recommend the use of combined hormonal contraceptive pills for menstrual suppression in pediatric blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients but recent research reveals that provider practice varies. This study was designed to describe the current practice for managing menstrual issues, that is, menstrual suppression and uterine bleeding, in pediatric BMT patients and to better understand health care providers' practices in the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). A cross sectional survey consisting of 53 questions was distributed via email to principal investigators in the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC). Responses were collected using www.surveymonkey.com. Menstrual suppression and uterine bleeding in pediatric BMT patients are primarily managed by pediatric oncologists (97%). The most frequently reported hormonal method used for induction of therapeutic amenorrhea was GnRHa (41%). The top three reasons for choosing a method were greater likelihood of amenorrhea, concerns about side effects, and possible gonadal protection. Continuous combined hormonal contraceptive pills were the most commonly used method for the management of clinically significant uterine bleeding regardless of primary method used for menstrual suppression. Despite the 2002 PBMTC guidelines, wide variation in menstrual suppression management practices still exists. Our data show that use of GnRHa is more common than previously reported. Additional research is needed to develop evidence-based practice guidelines in pediatric BMT patients.",['Adegite EA; Goyal RK; Murray PJ; Marshal M; Sucato GS'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22331813,current guidelines recommend the use of combined hormonal contraceptive pills for menstrual suppression in pediatric BMT recipients. but recent research reveals that provider practice varies.
Bone Density and Body Fat Distribution in Postmenopausal Women.,"In postmenopause there are changes in metabolism of bone tissue and consequent decrease of bone density. With ageing redistribution of fat occurs and an increase in body weight. Because of hormone changes in postmenopause fat is redistributed from gluteofemoral area to the abdominal region. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between bone density and a body mass index (BMI), and distribution of the fat tissue in women in postmenopause (WHR). This research was prospective, and it included total of 83 women, 53 women were in the natural postmenopause and 30 women with the regular menstruation. BMI in women in postmenopause was statistically significantly higher than BMI in women with the regular menstruations (p= 0,005). There was no statistically significant difference between waist hip ratio in women in the postmenopause in relation to the women with the regular menstruations. In women in the postmenopause significant positive correlation between BMI and density of the neck of femur was found (Z and T-score) (p=0,019; p=0,005). There was also significant negative correlation between the WHR and density of the lumbal spine (backbone) in women in the postmenopause (Z-score) (p=0,043). The identical analysis in women with regular menstruations, negative correlation between the density of the lumbal spine was found again (Z-score) and WHR , but the same was highly expressed (p=0,041). The observed correlation between BMI and bone density in this group of women was not statistically significant. Based on the presented results we conclude that the higher the BMI (p=0,019; p=0,005) the higher density of the femoral neck postmenopausal women have, and lower bone density of the lumbar spine the higher ratio waist / hip (p = 0.043).

2023 International Evidence-Based Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Guideline Update: Insights From a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Elevated Clinical Cardiovascular Disease in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent female endocrinopathy. Although increased cardiovascular risk factors are well established for the syndrome, PCOS remains overlooked within the realm of cardiology. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the risk of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in women with PCOS to inform the 2023 International Evidence-Based PCOS Guideline. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted comparing the risk of clinical CVD events in women with and without PCOS. Medline (Ovid), PsycInfo (Ovid), EMBASE, All EBM (Ovid), and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 2017, until March 1, 2023, to update the 2018 PCOS Guideline. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. Twenty studies involving 1.06 million women (369 317 with PCOS and 692 963 without PCOS) were included. PCOS was associated with higher risk of composite CVD (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.26-2.23]; I<sup>2</sup> = 71.0%), composite ischemic heart disease (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.07-2.05]; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.0%), myocardial infarction (OR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.43-4.38]; I<sup>2</sup> = 83.3%), and stroke (OR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.20-2.44]; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.4%). The relationship with cardiovascular mortality was less clear (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.53-2.69]; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Meta-analyses of IRRs support these findings. Results from pooled HRs were limited by the small number of studies and significant heterogeneity. This review provides evidence and highlights the importance of recognizing PCOS as a significant risk factor for CVD morbidity. The 2023 International Evidence-Based PCOS Guideline now recommends awareness of increased CVD risk and comprehensive risk assessment in PCOS to help mitigate the burden of CVD in this common and high-risk condition.",['Tay CT; Mousa A; Vyas A; Pattuwage L; Tehrani FR; Teede H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39119982,2023 international evidence-based PCOS guideline updated. systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted comparing the risk of clinical CVD events in women with and without PCOS.
Beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for dysmenorrhoea.,"Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological complaint that can affect as many as 50% of premenopausal women, 10% of whom suffer severely enough to be rendered incapacitated for one to three days during each menstrual cycle. Primary dysmenorrhoea is where women suffer from menstrual pain but lack any pathology in their pelvic anatomy. Beta2-adrenoceptor agonists have been used in the treatment of women with primary dysmenorrhoea but their effects are unclear. To determine the effectiveness and safety of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO and the EBM Reviews databases. The last search was on 22 August 2011. Randomised controlled trials comparing beta2-adrenoceptor agonists with placebo or no treatment, each other or any other conventional treatment in women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Five trials involving 187 women with an age range of 15 to 40 years were included. Oral isoxsuprine was compared with placebo in two trials; terbutaline oral spray, ritodrine chloride and oral hydroxyphenyl-orciprenalin were compared with placebo in a further three trials. Clinical diversity in the studies in terms of the interventions being evaluated, assessments at different time points and the use of different assessment tools mitigated against pooling of outcome data across studies in order to provide a summary estimate of effect for any of the comparisons. Only one study, with unclear risk of bias, reported pain relief with a combination of isoxsuprine, acetaminophen and caffeine. None of the other studies reported any significant clinical difference in effectiveness between the intervention and placebo. Adverse effects were reported with all of these medications in up to a quarter of the total number of participants. They included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, quivering, tremor and palpitations. The evidence presented in this review was based on a few relatively small-sized studies that were categorised to have unclear to high risk of bias, which does not allow confident decision-making at present about the use of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for dysmenorrhoea. The benefits as reported in one study should be balanced against the wide array of unacceptable side effects documented with this class of medication. We have emphasised the lack of precision and limitations in the reported data where appropriate.",['Fedorowicz Z; Nasser M; Jagannath VA; Beaman JH; Ejaz K; van Zuuren EJ'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22592732,beta2-adrenoceptor agonists have been used in the treatment of women with primary dysmenorrhoea. the effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists are unclear.
Hysterectomy versus hysterectomy plus oophorectomy for premenopausal women.,"Background Prophylactic oophorectomy alongside hysterectomy in premenopausal women is a common procedure. The decision to remove or conserve the ovaries is often based on the perceived risk for ovarian cancer and the need for additional gynaecological surgical interventions,and is weighed against the perceived risk of negative health effects caused by surgically induced menopause. The evidence needed to recommend either prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy or conservation of ovaries at the time of hysterectomy in premenopausal women is limited. This is an update of the original version of this systematic review published in 2008.Objectives To compare hysterectomy alone versus hysterectomy plus bilateral oophorectomy in women with benign gynaecological conditions,with respect to rates of mortality or subsequent gynaecological surgical interventions.Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (December 2005 to January 2014) and the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2014),EMBASE (January 1985 to January 2014), and PsycINFO (1806 to January 2014).Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hysterectomy alone versus hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal women with benign gynaecological conditions were eligible. Any surgical approach could be used.Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Study authors were contacted if information was unclear.Main results Only one RCT comparing the benefits and risks of hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy was identified. The results of this pilot RCT have not been published and we have not been able to obtain the results. Therefore, no data could be included in this review. Authors' conclusions The conclusions of this review are limited by a lack of RCTs. Although no evidence is available from RCTs, there is growing evidence from observational studies that surgical menopause may impact negatively on cardiovascular health and all cause mortality.",['Orozco LJ; Tristan M; Vreugdenhil MM; Salazar A'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25101365,hysterectomy versus hysterectomy plus oophorectomy in premenopausal women is common procedure. decision to remove or conserve ovaries often based on perceived risk for ovarian cancer. evidence needed to recommend either prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy or conservation of ovaries at the time of hysterectomy in premenopausal women is limited.
Reproducible stability of verbal and spatial functions along the menstrual cycle.,"Recent studies have reported brain changes in response to ovarian hormonal fluctuations along the menstrual cycle. However, it remains unclear, whether these brain changes are of an adaptive nature or whether they are linked to changes in behavior along the menstrual cycle, particularly with respect to cognitive performance. To address this knowledge gap, we report results from 3 well-powered behavioral studies with different task designs, leveraging the advantages of each design type. In all three studies we assessed whether verbal or spatial performance (i) differed between cycle phases, (ii) were related to estradiol and / or progesterone levels and (iii) were moderated by individual hormone sensitivity as estimated by premenstrual symptoms. Overall, results of all three studies point towards a null effect of menstrual cycle phase and - to a lesser extent - ovarian hormones on verbal and spatial performance and provided no evidence for a moderation of this effect by individual hormone sensitivity. We conclude that there is substantial consistency in verbal and spatial performance across the menstrual cycle, and that future studies of intra-individual variation are needed.",['Pletzer B; Bodenbach H; Hoehn M; Hajdari L; Hausinger T; Noachtar I; Beltz AM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38267632,ovarian hormones are a key factor in verbal and spatial performance. ovarian hormones are a key factor in verbal and spatial performance.
Correlation of PD-L1 expression with different clinico-pathological and immunohistochemical features of ovarian surface epithelial tumors.,"Primary carcinoma of the ovary (OCs) are responsible for a significant number of deaths related to cancer, and have the highest rate of death related to cancers of the female reproductive organs. Programmed cell death 1 (PD1) protein, acts as an immune checkpoint, and has an important role in the down-regulation of the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells, which will weaken the autoimmunity and increases self-tolerance. This study aimed at the evaluation of the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 in various primary surface ovarian epithelial tumours and to test its correlation with different clinicopathological parameters together with the expression of a panel of P53, ER and PR. A set of 102 cases of primary ovarian surface epithelial neoplasms (benign, borderline and malignant) were collected to construct Tissue Microarray (TMA) using 3 tissue cores from each case. IHC for PD-L1, p53, PR and ER was performed. The expression of PD-L1 was evaluated in relation to some clinicopathological parameters and to the expression patterns of other markers. Expression of PD-L1 was detected in about 51% (n = 36) of malignant tumours. The malignant group significantly showed PD-L1 positivity compared to borderline and benign groups. The malignant tumours significantly showed PD-L1 and total p53 positivity in comparison to borderline group. Also, malignant tumours significantly showed higher combined positivity of PD-L1 and either PR or ER compared to borderline and benign lesions. No significant correlation was appreciated between PD-L1 expression and with any of the studied clinicopathological parameters. This study showed a significant PD-L1 expression in malignant primary surface epithelial tumours. Construction of a panel of IHC markers, including PD-L1, could have a potential value to define patients those would benefit from the addition of immunotherapy to the treatment plan.",['Shalaby A; Shalaby O; Abdullah H; Boulassel MR; Arafa M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39090421,primary carcinoma of the ovary (OCs) are responsible for a significant number of deaths related to cancer. the highest rate of death related to cancers of the female reproductive organs.
Precise Serial Microregistration Enables Quantitative Microscopy Imaging Tracking of Human Skin Cells In Vivo.,"We developed an automated microregistration method that enables repeated in vivo skin microscopy imaging of the same tissue microlocation and specific cells over a long period of days and weeks with unprecedented precision. Applying this method in conjunction with an in vivo multimodality multiphoton microscope, the behavior of human skin cells such as cell proliferation, melanin upward migration, blood flow dynamics, and epidermal thickness adaptation can be recorded over time, facilitating quantitative cellular dynamics analysis. We demonstrated the usefulness of this method in a skin biology study by successfully monitoring skin cellular responses for a period of two weeks following an acute exposure to ultraviolet light.",['Tian Y; Wu Z; Lui H; Zhao J; Kalia S; Seo I; Ou-Yang H; Zeng H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38995009,"automated microregistration method enables repeated in vivo skin microscopy imaging of the same tissue microlocation and specific cells. the behavior of human skin cells such as cell proliferation, melanin upward migration, blood flow dynamics, and epidermal thickness adaptation can be recorded over time."
Does the Menstrual Cycle Influence Aerobic Capacity in Endurance-Trained Women?,"<b>Purpose:</b> The aim was to study if aerobic capacity varies during different phases of the menstrual cycle (MC) in endurance-trained female athletes. <b>Methods:</b> Ten endurance-trained eumenorrheic women performed a submaximal test followed by an incremental test until exhaustion three times during one MC, early follicular phase (EFP), late follicular phase (LFP), and midluteal phase (MLP). During the submaximal test, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and utilization of fat and carbohydrates were analyzed; and, during the incremental test, VO<sub>2 peak</sub>, maximal heart rate, utilization of fat and carbohydrates, and RER were analyzed. Lactate levels were analyzed at rest, during the submaximal test, and after the incremental test. The anaerobic threshold was determined at RER = 1. <b>Results:</b> No significant differences (<i>p</i> < .05) between the MC phases were seen in a maximal heart rate or VO<sub>2peak</sub>. Similarly, VO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate, RER, fatty acid oxidation, and carbohydrate oxidation at 70, 80, 90, and 100% of VO<sub>2peak</sub> did not differ significantly between MC phases. There were no significant differences between these phases in resting lactate before the test or during the submaximal tests, though there was a significant difference in lactate concentration 3 minutes after the incremental test between the EFP and the LFP (<i>p</i> = .043). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study did not display variations in physiological parameters between EFP, LFP, and MLP, indicating similar aerobic capacity despite hormonal variations. This knowledge may be useful when planning for competition in aerobic events.",['Ekberg S; Morseth B; Larsén KB; Wikström-Frisén L'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38109660,eumenorrheic women performed a submaximal test. the incremental test was followed by an incremental test. the respiratory exchange ratio was analyzed.
Rectal versus vaginal progesterone administration for luteal phase support in the hormone replacement therapy frozen embryo transfer (HRT-FET) cycle: protocol for a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.,"This study compares rectal administration with vaginal administration of progesterone as luteal phase support in hormone replacement therapy frozen embryo transfer (HRT-FET) cycles. The reason for comparing the two routes of administration is that rectal administration has been suggested to be more patient friendly. This study is a randomised controlled trial comparing the ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) at week 12 in HRT-FET cycles after rectal administered progesterone as the only administered progesterone compared with a vaginal luteal phase support regimen. All patients are enrolled from a Danish public fertility clinic and randomised to one of two groups, with 305 patients receiving embryo transfer assigned to each group. Endometrial preparation includes 6 mg oestradiol daily. The intervention group receives rectally administered progesterone (400 mg/12 hours) and the control group receives vaginally administered progesterone (400 mg/12 hours). If P4 is <35 nmol/L on blastocyst transfer day an additional rectal luteal phase rescue regimen is started (control group). Thawing and transferring of a single autologous vitrified blastocyst is scheduled on the sixth day of progesterone administration in both groups. The power calculation is based on a non-inferiority analysis with an expected OPR in both groups of 44% and the upper limit of a one-sided 95% CI will exclude a difference in favour of the control group of more than 10.0%. An interim analysis will be conducted once half of the study population has been enrolled. The trial was approved on 21 November 2023 by the Danish National Ethical Committee and the Danish Medicines Agency and is authorised by the Clinical Trials Information System (EUCT number 2023-504616-15-02).

Menstrual health matters. Period.,"Menstrual health is composed of physical and psychosocial factors and fundamental to the well-being of menstruating individuals. Clinicians are urged to assess markers of menstruation as a vital sign, informing potential current and future health risks. Period poverty, or lack of access to menstrual hygiene products, sanitation, and clinical support, is a concern worldwide, particularly for vulnerable populations.

A Theory for the Origin of Human Menopause.,"A complete and compelling evolutionary explanation for the origin of human menopause is wanting. Menopause onset is defined clinically as the final menses, confirmed after 1 year without menstruation. The theory proposed herein explains at multiple levels - ultimately genetic but involving (1) behavioral, (2) life history, and (3) social changes - the origin and evolution of menopause in women. Individuals in Lower Paleolithic human populations were characterized by short lifespans with diminished late-age survival and fertility, similar to contemporary chimpanzees, and thence were subject to three changes. (1) A mating behavior change was established in which only young women reproduced, thereby rendering as effectively neutral female-specific late-onset fertility-diminishing mutations, which accumulated subsequently. (2) A lifespan increase was manifested adaptively, revealing the reproductive senescence phenotype encoded in late-onset fertility-diminishing mutation genotypes, which, heretofore, had been unexpressed in the shorter lifespan. (3) A social interaction change emerged exaptively, when older non-reproductive women exclusively started assisting in rearing grandchildren rather than giving birth to and caring for their own children, ultimately leading to menstrual cycle cessation. The changes associate in a one-to-one manner with existing, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin of human menopause. Evidence for each hypothesis and its associated change having occurred are reviewed, and the hypotheses are combined in a synthetic theory for the origin of human menopause. The new theory simultaneously addresses the main theoretical problem with each hypothesis and yields predictions for future testing.",['Takahashi M; Singh RS; Stone J'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28111590,"menopause onset is defined clinically as the final menses. menopause onset is confirmed after 1 year without menstruation. theory explains at multiple levels - ultimately genetic but involving (1) behavioral, (2) life history, and (3) social changes."
Eight-hour time-restricted feeding improves endocrine and metabolic profiles in women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a form of intermittent fasting, which is beneficial for weight loss and cardiometabolic health. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine and metabolic diseases affecting women of childbearing age. It is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The effects of TRF on PCOS patients remains undefined, here we investigated the impact of TRF on women with anovulatory PCOS. Eighteen PCOS women aged between 18 and 31 with anovulation participated in a 6-week trial which were divided into two consecutive periods: (1) 1-week baseline weight stabilization period and (2) 5-week TRF period. Fifteen participants completed the study. Changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), Waist-to-Hip Ratio, skeletal muscle mass, body fat mass (BFM), body fat percentage (BF%), visceral fat area (VFA), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH/FSH, total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), fasting glucose, fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (AUCIns), area under the curve (AUC) for glucose (AUCGlu), AUCIns/AUCGlu Ratio, lipids, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), menstrual cycle and eating behaviors were evaluated. Significant changes in body weight, BMI, BFM, BF%, VFA, TT, SHBG, FAI, FINS, HOMA-IR, AUCIns, AUCIns/AUCGlu Ratio, ALT, hsCRP and IGF-1 were found after the TRF period. An improvement in menstrual cycle irregularity was detected in 73.3% (11/15) patients. The diet of TRF may be beneficial to anovulatory PCOS on weight loss especially reducing body fat, improving menstruation, hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation.

Study on the effects and mechanisms of Wenzhong Bushen Formula in improving ovarian reserve decline in mice based on network pharmacology.,"The Wenzhong Bushen Formula (WZBSF) is a traditional Chinese medicine empirical formula known for its effects in tonifying qi, strengthening the spleen, warming the kidneys, promoting yang, regulating blood circulation, and balancing menstruation. Clinical evidence has demonstrated its significant efficacy in treating Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) by improving ovarian reserves. However, the specific pharmacological mechanisms of WZBSF remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which WZBSF improves ovarian reserve decline through network pharmacology and animal experiments. WZBSF was analyzed using a dual UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS platform. Effective components and targets of WZBSF were obtained from the TCMSP database and standardized using UniProt. Disease targets were collected from GeneCard, OMIM, PHARMGKB, and DisGeNET databases, with cross-referencing between the two sets of targets. A PPI protein interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape3.9.1 and STRING database, followed by KEGG and GO enrichment analysis using the Metascape database. Finally, an ovarian reserve decline model was established in mice, different doses of WZBSF were administered, and experimental validation was conducted through serum hormone detection, H&E staining, immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot analysis (WB). WZBSF shares 145 common targets with ovarian reserve decline. GO enrichment analysis revealed involvement in biological processes such as response to hormone stimulation and phosphatase binding, while KEGG analysis implicated pathways including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. In mice with ovarian reserve decline, WZBSF restored weight gain rate, increased ovarian index, normalized estrous cycles, reversed serum hormone imbalances, restored various follicle counts, and improved ovarian morphology. Additionally, WZBSF reduced p-AKT and p-FOXO3a levels, preventing excessive activation of primordial follicles and maintaining ovarian reserve. WZBSF can ameliorate cyclophosphamide and busulfan-induced ovarian reserve decline, and its mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway.",['Liang X; Xie H; Yu L; Ouyang J; Peng Q; Chen K; Liu F; Chen H; Chen X; Du X; Zhu X; Li G; He R'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38218503,"the wenzhong Bushen Formula (WZBSF) is a traditional Chinese medicine empirical formula known for its effects in tonifying qi, strengthening the spleen, warming the kidneys, promoting yang. clinical evidence has demonstrated its significant efficacy in treating Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) by improving ovarian reserves."
Commit to your putting stroke: exploring the impact of quiet eye duration and neural activity on golf putting performance.,"There is a growing interest in characterizing the cognitive-motor processes that underlie superior performance in highly skilled athletes. The aim of this study was to explore neural markers of putting performance in highly skilled golfers by recording mobile EEG (electroencephalogram) during the pre-shot period. Twenty-eight right-handed participants (20 males) with a mean age of 24.2 years (± 6.4) and an average handicap of +1.7 (± 6.4) completed a testing session. Following the warm-up, participants completed 140 putts from a distance of 8ft (2.4m), with putts taken from 5 different positions. While putting, participants wore an eye tracker and a gel-based EEG system with 32 electrodes. Time and frequency domain features of the EEG signals were extracted to characterize Movement-Related Cortical Potentials (MRCP) and rhythmic modulations of neural activity in theta, alpha, sensorimotor and beta frequency bands associated with putting performance. Eye-tracking data demonstrate that mean Quiet Eye durations are not a reliable marker of expertise as the same duration was found for both successful and unsuccessful putts. Following rigorous data processing data from 12 participants (8 males, mean age 21.6 years ± 5.4, average handicap +1.5 ± 4.4) were included in the EEG analysis. MRCP analysis revealed performance-based differences, with unsuccessful putts having a greater negative amplitude in comparison to successful putts. Time frequency analysis of the EEG data revealed that successful putts exhibit distinct neural activity profiles compared to unsuccessful ones. For successful putts, greater suppression of beta was present in the central region prior to the putt. By contrast, increased frontal theta power was present for unsuccessful putts immediately before the putt (consistent with hesitation and the need for motor plan adjustments prior to execution). We propose that neural activity may provide plausible insights into the mechanisms behind why identical QE durations can lead to both success and failure. From an applied perspective, this study highlights the merits of a multi-measure approach to gain further insights into performance differences within highly skilled golfers. We discuss considerations for future research and solutions to address the challenges related to the complexities of collecting clean EEG signals within naturalistic sporting contexts.",['Carey LM; Alexandrou G; Ladouce S; Kourtis D; Berchicci M; Hunter AM; Donaldson DI'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39055992,study explores neural markers of putting performance in highly skilled golfers. participants completed 140 putts from a distance of 8ft (2.4m).

Turner syndrome: contemporary thoughts and reproductive issues.,"Turner syndrome is a common genetic disorder that has been classically associated with a 45,X karyotype. Several X-chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in these patients, many of which involve mosaicism. These patients have variable but predictable phenotypic findings and are at risk for development of endocrine, autoimmune, and structural abnormalities. As many as 1.5% of the population with Turner syndrome may develop dissection and rupture of the ascending aorta; the presence of abnormalities of the cardiac tree and hypertension increase this risk, but their absence does not preclude it. Rupture has occurred at aortic diameters smaller than previously reported for other patient populations. Five percent or more of women with Turner syndrome may have abbreviated menstrual function before developing amenorrhea and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. An estimated 1 to 2% of all patients may become pregnant. Only three patients with Turner syndrome (and two of them with streak ovaries) have ever been reported to become pregnant after developing amenorrhea and elevated gonadotropin levels. Pregnancy, either spontaneous or more commonly from donor oocyte, increases maternal mortality rate for these women by an estimated ≥100 fold. It appears that all Turner women are at risk of rupture; neither prior spontaneous menses nor age >30 years provides protection. In addition, the literature suggests that the physiological changes of pregnancy may increase the risk of rupture in future years after delivery for those Turner women who seemingly made it safely through pregnancy. The use of the term PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY (POI) for Turner syndrome gives me some discomfort. For women with 46,XX hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, POI accurately provides the suggestion that follicular depletion is often not complete (although remissions are usually self-limiting and the vast majority of patients will not spontaneously become pregnant). I clearly understand the need to prevent any stigmatization to patients unfortunately diagnosed with premature oocyte depletion, and I believe that the use of the diagnosis POI leaves the door open for the occurrence of reproductive function and for the 5 to 10% of 46,XX patients who may spontaneously become pregnant. However, the world literature reports only two women with Turner syndrome, hypergonadotropic amenorrhea, and streak ovaries who have ever become pregnant spontaneously after their diagnosis. It would be unfair to such women with Turner syndrome to give them the same hope for pregnancy as we do for women with 46,XX POI. Amenorrheic women with Turner syndrome truly have ovarian failure. Although I have adopted the term POI in this article for women with Turner syndrome, semantics are no substitute for honest, thorough, and compassionate counseling.",['Reindollar RH'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21969268,"Turner syndrome is a common genetic disorder that has been classically associated with a 45,X karyotype. it is at risk for developing endocrine, autoimmune, and structural abnormalities. only three patients with Turner syndrome have ever been reported to become pregnant."
Safety and efficacy of chastetree (Vitex agnus-castus) during pregnancy and lactation.,"There is a lack of basic knowledge on the part of both clinicians and patients as to the indications for use and safety of herbs used during pregnancy and lactation. This is one article in a series that systematically reviews the evidence for herbs commonly used during pregnancy and lactation. To systematically review the literature for evidence on the use, safety and pharmacology of chastetree, focusing on issues pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. We searched 7 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. RESULTS In pregnancy, there is poor evidence based on theoretical and expert opinion and in vitro studies that chastetree may have estrogenic and progesteronic activity, uterine stimulant activity, emmenagogue activity and prevent miscarriages. In lactation, theoretical and expert opinion conflict as to whether chastetree increases or decreases lactation. Given its relatively common use amongst women of childbearing age, it is likely that some women may consume chastetree while unknowingly pregnant. Complementary and alternative medicine, midwifery and medical practitioners should be aware of this fact when prescribing chastetree to women of childbearing age, particularly when the patient is planning a family.

Functional determinants of uterine contractility in endometriosis and adenomyosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Evidence suggests that aberrant uterine contractility in nonpregnant women with endometriosis and adenomyosis contributes to symptoms and potentially heralds their pathogenesis. However, uterine peristalsis remains understudied, inconsistently measured, and poorly understood. To summarize evidence on uterine contractility across the menstrual cycle phases in women with endometriosis and adenomyosis. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases searched up to May 2nd, 2024. Observational studies compared quantitative measures of uterine contractility using MRI, ultrasound, electrophysiology or direct intrauterine pressure recording across different menstrual cycle phases between women with endometriosis/adenomyosis and controls based on pre-defined PICOS criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled estimates for primary (risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) and secondary outcomes (mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Pooled risk of retrograde menstruation uterine contraction pattern in cases versus controls; pooled MD in continuous measures of uterine contractility (frequency, amplitude, and velocity of contractions) across all the menstrual cycle phases in cases versus controls. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria; most were studies that evaluated women with endometriosis. An increased risk of retrograde uterine contractions during menstruation was observed in women with endometriosis compared to controls (RR, 8.63; 95% CI, 3.24-22.95; I<sup>2</sup>=0%). The pooled MD in contraction frequency between cases and controls was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.13-1.52; I<sup>2</sup>=18.61%) in the menstrual phase and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22-0.83; I<sup>2</sup>=27.18%) in the luteal phase. Results for the follicular and peri-ovulatory phases were more heterogeneous. Higher contraction amplitudes in women with endometriosis or adenomyosis were reported across all menstrual cycle phases. Due to the paucity of data, especially for adenomyosis, evidence certainty was graded as low for most comparisons. The approximately 9-fold increased risk of retrograde pattern during menstruation in endometriosis supports the potential role of retrograde menstruation in its etiopathogenesis. Abnormal uterine contractility, likely not limited to the menstrual phase, may be a mechanical factor contributing to development of endometriosis and related symptoms, including menstrual pain and infertility, with limited, mostly concordant evidence for adenomyosis.",['Salmeri N; Di Stefano G; Viganò P; Stratton P; Somgliana E; Vercellini P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39067674,"uterine peristalsis remains understudied, inconsistently measured, and poorly understood. observational studies compared quantitative measures of uterine contractility across different menstrual cycle phases."
The role of diet in managing menopausal symptoms: A narrative review.,"Menopause is a natural stage that occurs when women stop menstruating, during which many women experience physical and psychological symptoms that can affect their quality of life and ability to work. Dietary modifications and food supplements may be explored by some women as alternatives to hormone replacement therapy, although existing reviews and expert position statements have given this limited consideration. This narrative review summarises the current evidence for dietary patterns, and botanical and food supplements, in the management of common menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flushes; night sweats), changes in bodyweight and composition, psychological symptoms (depression; anxiety; cognitive changes), sleep disturbances, joint pain, skin changes and urogenital symptoms. Soy isoflavones may reduce the frequency and/or severity of VMS, although results are inconsistent, and it is unclear whether dietary and supplemental sources have comparable effects. Adopting a healthier dietary pattern may support a healthy bodyweight and benefit VMS. However, evidence suggesting dietary patterns may benefit depression, anxiety, and cognition remains largely observational. While some botanicals, such as black cohosh and St John's Wort, have been reported in some studies to alleviate symptoms (such as VMS and depression), these are not currently recommended due to uncertainty about the appropriate dose and preparation, and potential safety concerns. Evidence for other symptoms is currently too limited to draw conclusions. While further trials at different menopausal stages are needed, adopting a healthier dietary pattern in accordance with dietary guidelines is likely to help support women's health before, during and after the menopausal transition.",['Yelland S; Steenson S; Creedon A; Stanner S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36792552,menopause is a natural stage that occurs when women stop menstruating. some women experience physical and psychological symptoms that can affect their quality of life and ability to work. dietary changes and food supplements may be explored as alternatives to hormone replacement therapy.
"Effect of occupational exposure to vat-textile dyes on follicular and luteal hormones in female dye workers in Abeokuta, Nigeria.","Some synthetic dyes used mainly in textile industries have been associated with endocrine disruption, resulting in infertility, among other disorders. It is unknown if occupational exposure to Vat textile dyes among premenopausal dyers alters hormonal levels. We aimed at determining the probable effects of occupational exposure to Vat dyes on reproductive hormones of female textile dyers in the follicular and luteal phases while relating this to age categories and duration of exposure. Thirty-three premenopausal Vat textile dyers at ""Itoku"", Abeokuta, Nigeria, among a population of about 80 female dyers were age and sex-matched with 55 non-exposed (control) female participants. Using semi-structured questionnaires, socio-demographic, occupational details and the LMP of participants were obtained. Serum samples were collected in follicular and luteal phases and assayed for female sex hormones using Enzyme Immunoassay. Mann-Whitney U and Z- statistic were used for comparison of the two groups. P-value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. In the follicular phase, the result showed a lower mean FSH ranking (in age category ≤20 years) and higher (p<0.05) Estradiol ranking (in age category 31-40 years) in the exposed than the unexposed. Mean ranks of Progesterone and Estradiol in the luteal phase (age category 31-40 years) were higher (p<0.05) in the exposed, while Estradiol (age category ≥41years) ranked lower (p<0.05). Prolactin demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with the duration of exposure. Occupational exposure to Vat dye among female dyers in Abeokuta is associated with some sex hormone disruption which appears to be age and duration of exposure-related.",['Soyinka OO; Akinsanya AF; Odeyemi FA; Amballi AA; Oritogun KS; Ogundahunsi OA'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38962357,"premenopausal dyers at ""Itoku"", abeokuta, Nigeria, were age and sex-matched with 55 non-exposed female participants. a study found that occupational exposure to vat-textile dyes alters hormonal levels."
Knee Laxities Changes with Sex-steroids throughout the Menstrual Cycle Phases in Athlete and Non-athlete Females.,"<b>Objective:</b>  Our study investigated changes of knee laxities in athletes and non-athletes females and relationship between knee laxity and sex-steroid at menstrual cycle phases. <b>Methods:</b>  Forty six healthy females, twenty four athletes and twenty two non-athletes not on hormone contraceptive pills, had no previous knee injuries and with regular menstrual cycles for 3 consecutive months, participated in the study. Medial and lateral knee laxities were determined by varus-valgus tests at follicular, ovulatory and luteal phases. Serum level of relaxin, estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were determined by ELISA and radioimmunoassay. <b>Results:</b>  Knee laxities in athletes and non-athletes at 0° and 20° flexion were the highest in luteal phase with non-athletes possess greater laxity than athletes. Positive correlation between progesterone and relaxin levels with knee laxities were observed. Meanwhile, the levels of both hormones were highest in the luteal phase. <b>Conclusion:</b>  Increased medial and lateral knee laxities in athletes and non-athletes associated with high serum progesterone and relaxin levels in luteal phase may contribute toward increased risk of non-contact knee injury. However, lower knee laxity in athletes than non-athletes suggest that exercise could be a protective factor.",['Dehghan F; Soori R; Yusof A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38524710,menstrual cycle phases in athletes and non-athletes females have no previous knee injuries. a study investigated changes of knee laxities in athletes and non-athletes.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults.,"The estimated lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults worldwide has been estimated at 3.9%. PTSD appears to contribute to alterations in neuronal network connectivity patterns. Current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are associated with inadequate symptom improvement and high dropout rates. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive therapy involving induction of electrical currents in cortical brain tissue, may be an important treatment option for PTSD to improve remission rates and for people who cannot tolerate existing treatments. To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two clinical trials registers. We checked reference lists of relevant articles. The most recent search was January 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of rTMS versus sham rTMS for PTSD in adults from any treatment setting, including veterans. Eligible trials employed at least five rTMS treatment sessions with both active and sham conditions. We included trials with combination interventions, where a pharmacological agent or psychotherapy was combined with rTMS for both intervention and control groups. We included studies meeting the above criteria regardless of whether they reported any of our outcomes of interest. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane standards. Primary outcomes were PTSD severity immediately after treatment and serious adverse events during active treatment. Secondary outcomes were PTSD remission, PTSD response, PTSD severity at two follow-up time points after treatment, dropouts, and depression and anxiety severity immediately after treatment. We included 13 RCTs in the review (12 published; 1 unpublished dissertation), with 577 participants. Eight studies included stand-alone rTMS treatment, four combined rTMS with an evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment, and one investigated rTMS as an adjunctive to treatment-as-usual. Five studies were conducted in the USA, and some predominantly included white, male veterans. Active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.54 to 0.27; 3 studies, 99 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for imprecision (sample size insufficient to detect a difference of medium effect size). We deemed one study as having a low risk of bias and the remaining two as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of change-from-baseline scores enabled inclusion of a greater number of studies (6 studies, 252 participants). This analysis yielded a similar outcome to our main analysis but also indicated significant heterogeneity in efficacy across studies, including two studies with a high risk of bias. Reported rates of serious adverse events were low, with seven reported (active rTMS: 6; sham rTMS: 1). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of active rTMS on serious adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 5.26, 95% CI 0.26 to 107.81; 5 studies, 251 participants; very low-certainty evidence [Active rTMS: 23/1000, sham rTMS: 4/1000]). We downgraded the evidence by one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. We rated four of five studies as having a high risk of bias, and the fifth as 'some concerns' for bias. We were unable to assess PTSD remission immediately after treatment as none of the included studies reported this outcome. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our review suggests that active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment compared to sham stimulation. However, significant heterogeneity in efficacy was detected when we included a larger number of studies in sensitivity analysis. We observed considerable variety in participant and protocol characteristics across studies included in this review. For example, studies tended to be weighted towards inclusion of either male veterans or female civilians. Studies varied greatly in terms of the proportion of the sample with comorbid depression. Study protocols differed in treatment design and stimulation parameters (e.g. session number/duration, treatment course length, stimulation intensity/frequency, location of stimulation). These differences may affect efficacy, particularly when considering interactions with participant factors. Reported rates of serious adverse events were very low (< 1%) across active and sham conditions. It is uncertain whether rTMS increases the risk of serious adverse event occurrence, as our certainty of evidence was very low. Studies frequently lacked clear definitions for serious adverse events, as well as detail on tracking/assessment of data and information on the safety population. Increased reporting on these elements would likely aid the advancement of both research and clinical recommendations of rTMS for PTSD. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to meta-analyze PTSD remission, PTSD treatment response, and PTSD severity at different periods post-treatment. Further research into these outcomes could inform the clinical use of rTMS. Additionally, the relatively large contribution of data from trials that focused on white male veterans may limit the generalizability of our conclusions. This could be addressed by prioritizing recruitment of more diverse participant samples.",['Brown R; Cherian K; Jones K; Wickham R; Gomez R; Sahlem G'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39092744,rTMS may be an important treatment option for PTSD to improve remission rates. current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are associated with inadequate symptom improvement and high dropout rates.
Hydromorphological degradation modifies long-term macroinvertebrate responses to water quality and climate changes in lowland rivers.,"Due to decades of persistent anthropogenic pressures, lowland rivers represent one of the most severely impaired habitats in Europe. Despite improved water quality, novel stressors, particularly climate change, are emerging with most lowland rivers suffering from past hydromorphological degradation. We aim to elucidate how such degradation alters the biological response in multiple-stressor environments, as this has rarely been considered in studies documenting long-term development of anthropogenically impacted rivers. Here, benthic macroinvertebrates, water quality and hydroclimatic variables were monitored over a period of two decades in nine of the largest Czech rivers. Detailed data on hydromorphological degradation allowed us to track distinct patterns in rivers with high and low levels of degradation. Temporal changes in environmental variables showed similar patterns in both site groups, characterised by reduced organic and nutrient pollution but increased hydroclimatic and salinity stress. 150 % increase in total abundance, especially in abundance and richness of sediment-dwelling and non-native taxa was found in both site groups. While the increase in abundance was due to improved water quality and rising water temperature, the longer duration of minimal flows had a negative effect on species richness, hampering species gain particularly at highly degraded sites. Our results provide novel evidence that degree of hydromorphological degradation modifies long-term macroinvertebrate responses to anthropogenic pressures. Less degraded sites displayed several favourable changes, such as 27 % increase in total and 23 % increase in potamal indicator richness, and stabilisation of the assemblages with few functional changes. In contrast, highly degraded sites experienced 9 % reduction in evenness, 235 % increase in proportion of non-native taxa and functional reorganisation, changes congruent with continuous deterioration. While overall water quality at studied sites has improved, consequences of climate change and high degree of hydromorphological degradation limit biotic recovery in multiple-stressor lowland rivers.",['de Donnová S; Devánová A; Barešová L; Zahrádková S; Bojková J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39032623,"hydromorphological degradation modifies long-term macroinvertebrate responses to water quality and climate changes in lowland rivers. despite decades of persistent anthropogenic pressures, lowland rivers represent one of the most severely impaired habitats in Europe."
A clustering approach identifies an Autism Spectrum Disorder subtype more responsive to chronic oxytocin treatment.,"Over the last decade, a number of clinical trials have reported effects of chronic treatment with intranasal oxytocin on autistic symptoms but with inconsistent findings. Autism is a heterogeneous disorder and one factor which may influence treatment outcome is whether a subtype of individuals is more sensitive to oxytocin. In a recent cross-over trial on 41 young autistic children we reported that 44% showed a reliable improvement in clinical symptoms (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS-2) after a placebo-controlled, 6-week intranasal oxytocin intervention where treatment was given every other day followed by a period of positive social interaction. In the current re-assessment of the data, we used an unsupervised data-driven cluster analysis approach to identify autism subtypes using 23 different demographic, social subtype, endocrine, eye-tracking and clinical symptom measures taken before treatment and this revealed an optimum of two different subtypes. We then assessed the proportion of identified responders to oxytocin and found that while 61.5% of one subtype included responders only 13.3% of the other did so. During the placebo phase there was no difference between the two subtypes for the small proportion of responders (19.2% vs 6.7%). This oxytocin-sensitive subtype also showed overall significant post-treatment clinical and eye-tracking measure changes. The oxytocin-sensitive subtype was primarily characterized at baseline by lower initial clinical severity (ADOS-2) and greater interest in the eye-region of emotional faces. These features alone were nearly as efficient in identifying the two subtypes as all 23 baseline measures and this easy-to-conduct approach may help rapidly and objectively screen for oxytocin responders. Future clinical trials using oxytocin interventions may therefore achieve greater success by focusing on children with this specific autism subtype and help develop individualized oxytocin intervention.",['Zhao W; Le J; Liu Q; Zhu S; Lan C; Zhang Q; Zhang Y; Li Q; Kou J; Yang W; Zhang R; Becker B; Zhang L; Kendrick KM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39075076,autism spectrum disorder subtype more responsive to chronic oxytocin treatment. oxytocin-sensitive subtype also showed significant post-treatment clinical and eye-tracking measure changes.

Individual variation of follicular phase changes in endothelial function across two menstrual cycles.,"What is the central question of this study? The purpose of this study was to determine intra-individual reproducibility of follicular phase changes in endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation) over two menstrual cycles in healthy, premenopausal women. What is the main finding and its importance? Phase changes in endothelial function were not consistent at the individual level across two menstrual cycles, which challenges the utility of interpreting individual responses over one cycle. Evidence regarding the impact of menstrual phase on endothelial function is conflicting, and studies to date have examined responses only over a single cycle. It is unknown whether the observed inter-individual variability of phase changes in endothelial function reflects stable, inter-individual differences in responses to oestrogen (E<sub>2</sub> ; a primary female sex hormone). The purpose of this study was to examine changes in endothelial function from the early follicular (EF; low-E<sub>2</sub> ) phase to the late follicular (LF; high-E<sub>2</sub> ) phase over two consecutive cycles. Fourteen healthy, regularly menstruating women [22 ± 3 years of age (mean ± SD)] participated in four visits (EF<sub>Visit 1</sub> , LF<sub>Visit 2</sub> , EF<sub>Visit 3</sub> and LF<sub>Visit 4</sub> ) over two cycles. Ovulation testing was used to determine the time between the LF visit and ovulation. During each visit, endothelial function [brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)], E<sub>2</sub> and progesterone were assessed. At the group level, there was no impact of phase or cycle on FMD (P = 0.48 and P = 0.65, respectively). The phase change in FMD in cycle 1 did not predict the phase change in cycle 2 (r = 0.03, P = 0.92). Using threshold-based classification (2 × typical error threshold), four of 14 participants (29%) exhibited directionally consistent phase changes in FMD across cycles. Oestrogen was not correlated between cycles, and this might have contributed to variability in the FMD response. The intra-individual variability in follicular fluctuation in FMD between menstrual cycles challenges the utility of interpreting individual responses to phase over a single menstrual cycle.",['Liu KR; Lew LA; McGarity-Shipley EC; Byrne AC; Islam H; Fenuta AM; Pyke KE'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33866631,study was to determine intra-individual reproducibility of follicular phase changes in endothelial function. phase changes in endothelial function were not consistent at individual level. study examined responses only over a single cycle.
"Long-term surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the school community from Campo Grande, Brazil.","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted education systems worldwide, with Brazil being one of the countries with the longest school closures. Over a million children and teenagers have been affected, leading to increased hunger and nutritional deficiencies. This study aimed to implement long-term surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in public and private schools in Campo Grande, Brazil, after returning to in-person classes. The study involved testing and genomic surveillance at 23 public and private schools in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, from October 18, 2021 to November 21, 2022. The participants eligible for enrollment were students aged 6-17 years and staff members from school institutions. At the time of collection, participants were asked if they had symptoms in the last two weeks. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted to identify circulating variants and to compare them with those detected in the municipality. The demographic data and clinical history of the participants were described, and a logistic regression model was used to understand how the RT-qPCR results could be related to different characteristics. The study included 999 participants, most of whom were women. A total of 85 tests were positive, with an overall positivity rate of 3.2%. The dynamics of case frequency were consistent with those observed in the municipality during the study period. The most common symptoms reported were cough, rhinorrhea, headache, and sore throat. Symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eleven lineages were identified in school community samples, with a frequency of occurrence per period similar to that found in the sequences available for the municipality. The most prevalent lineages within the sampling period were BA.2 (59.3%) and BA.5 (29.6%). Our findings demonstrate that schools can play a crucial role in epidemiological surveillance, helping trigger rapid responses to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Long-term surveillance can be used to track outbreaks and assess the role of children and adults in transmission. It can also contribute to pandemic preparedness, enabling a rapid response to emergencies, such as COVID-19.",['Alcantara DMC; Dos Santos CM; Torres JM; Stutz C; Vieira CA; Moreira RMDS; Rodrigues R; Marcon GEB; Ferreira EC; Mendes FML; Sarti ECFB; de Oliveira TF; Lemos EF; Andrade UV; Lichs GGC; Demarchi LHF; Zardin MCSU; Gonçalves CCM; Guilhermino JF; Fernandez ZDC'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39085807,"the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted education systems worldwide. over a million children and teenagers have been affected, leading to increased hunger and nutritional deficiencies."
Effects of repeated menstrual pain on empathic neural responses in women with primary dysmenorrhea across the menstrual cycle.,"Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM) is cyclic menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic anomalies, and it is thought to be a sex-hormone related disorder. Existing study has focused on the effects of menstrual cramps on brain function and structure, ignoring the psychological changes associated with menstrual pain. Here we examined whether pain empathy in PDM differs from healthy controls (HC) using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty-seven PDM women and 53 matched HC were recruited, and data were collected at the luteal and menstruation phases, respectively. During fMRI scans, participants viewed pictures displaying exposure to painful situations and pictures without any pain cues and assessed the level of pain experienced by the person in the picture. Regarding the main effect of the pain pictures, our results showed that compared to viewing neutral pictures, viewing pain pictures caused significantly higher activation in the anterior insula (AI), anterior cingulate cortex, and the left inferior parietal lobule; and only the right AI exhibited a significant interaction effect (group × picture). Post-hoc analyses confirmed that, relative to neutral pictures, the right AI failed to be activated in PDM women viewing painsss pictures. Additionally, there was no significant interaction effect between the luteal and menstruation phases. It suggests that intermittent pain can lead to abnormal empathy in PDM women, which does not vary with the pain or pain-free phase. Our study may deepen the understanding of the relationship between recurrent spontaneous pain and empathy in a clinical disorder characterized by cyclic episodes of pain.",['Wang C; Liu Y; Dun W; Zhang T; Yang J; Wang K; Mu J; Zhang M; Liu J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030796,primary dysmenorrhea is cyclic menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic anomalies. it is thought to be a sex-hormone related disorder. fMRI scans showed pain empathy in PDM differs from healthy controls.
A randomised controlled trial assessing the potential of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) to act as an adjuvant to resistance training in healthy adults: a study protocol.,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics are used frequently by athletes either prophylactically for the prevention of pain, or to accelerate recovery following an injury. However, these types of pain management strategies have been shown to inhibit signalling pathways (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2) that may hinder muscular adaptations such as hypertrophy and strength. Nutraceuticals such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have analgesic properties that act via different mechanisms to NSAIDS/analgesics. Furthermore, PEA has been shown to have a positive effect on sleep and may contribute positively to muscle hypertrophy via PKB activation. Although PEA has not been widely studied in the athletic or recreationally active population, it may provide an alternative solution for pain management if it is found not to interfere with, or enhance training adaptations. Therefore, the study aim is to investigate the effects of daily PEA supplementation (Levagen + ®) with resistance training on lean body mass, strength, power and physical performance and outcomes of recovery (e.g., sleep) compared to placebo. This double-blind, randomised controlled study will take place over an 11-week period (including 8-weeks of progressive resistance training). Participants for this study will be 18-35 years old, healthy active adults that are not resistance trained. Participants will attend a familiarisation (week 0), pre-testing (week 1) and final-testing (week 11). At the pre-testing and final-testing weeks, total lean body mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA), total mid-thigh cross sectional area (pQCT), maximal muscular strength (1 repetition maximum bench press, isometric mid-thigh pull) and power (countermovement jump and bench throw) will be assessed. Additionally, circulating inflammatory cytokines and anabolic hormones, sleep quality and quantity (ActiGraph), pain and subjective wellbeing (questionnaires) will also be examined. This study is designed to investigate the effects that PEA may have on pre-to post intervention changes in total body and regional lean muscle mass, strength, power, sleep, subjective wellbeing, and pain associated with resistance training and menstruation compared with the placebo condition. Unlike other NSAIDs and analgesics, which may inhibit muscle protein synthesis and training adaptations, PEA which provides analgesia via alternative mechanisms may provide an alternative pain management solution. It is therefore important to determine if this analgesic compound interferes with or enhances training adaptations so that athletes and active individuals can make an informed decision on their pain management strategies.

Screening to understand pregnancy preferences and offer referrals and treatment (SUPPORT): Results of a pilot quality improvement initiative.,"To assess the feasibility of integrating a pregnancy intention assessment screening algorithm into the electronic medical record (EMR) at a multispecialty clinic focused on the health of women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). This pilot quality improvement project implemented a series of clinician reminders, new data fields in the patient record, and templated clinical notes to prompt care providers across specialties to ask AFAB reproductive age individuals about their desire for future pregnancies. Investigators created a novel screening question based on prior literature and expert input. Prospective observational study of one year of during-intervention EMR data on screening uptake and documentation, contraceptive use, and referrals to obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) for preconception care, contraceptive care, and related services. SUPPORT launched in February 2020 and was paused for 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the intervention period through July 2021, 18% of patients for whom the automated screening reminder was activated had a documented pregnancy intention. Patients were screened in OBGYN, internal medicine, and eight subspecialty medical clinics. Among those screened, individuals who reported they did not desire pregnancy in the next year were more likely to use contraception (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1). Individuals that did desire pregnancy in the next year were more likely to be subsequently referred to OBGYN (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2, 6.0). Despite the competing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SUPPORT intervention was utilized at higher rates than prior similar interventions and across multiple disease specialties. Results from the SUPPORT pilot suggest that pregnancy intention screening of reproductive age AFAB individuals with an EMR-based screening prompt is feasible at scale.",['Janiak E; Rexrode K; Santacroce L; Johns SL; Behn M; Braaten KP; Feldman CH'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39074124,"pilot quality improvement project implemented clinician reminders, new data fields in patient record. a series of reminders and templated clinical notes prompt care providers to ask AFAB reproductive age individuals about their desire for future pregnancies."
"Changes in ageing women's sexual subjectivity as seen from a life course perspective: security, caring, and desire.","This article explores the sexual subjectivity of women of post-reproductive age who seek partners on dating apps. The existing literature highlights the sexual subjectivity and agency of older women as contested and not sufficiently investigated. Even less research has been conducted on changes in the sexual subjectivity of women born in the USSR in the 1960s, with the liberalisation of sexual behaviour. The study is based on 45 interviews with women aged 55 years and over, who were born in the USSR and who now live in Israel, Finland and Russia. In the article, we examine sexual subjectivity as presented in the interviews from a life course perspective. We explain theoretically and empirically how changes in sexual subjectivity are expressed in the light of age and socio-cultural context constraints. Three life stories highlight the accumulation of experience and turning points, such as divorce and migration. They illustrate very different pathways in changing sexual subjectivity, yet all contain three <i>Leitmotifs</i>: desire, security and caring. The expression of post-reproductive female desire can be related to the need to feel secure and enjoy mutual care in sexual relationships. We show that these Leitmotifs shape and are shaped by women's identifications as both sexual objects and subjects, and explore how they relate to different sexual cultures and variations in the socio-sexual positioning of women in Israel, Finland, and Russia.",['Temkina A; Shpakovskaya L; Lavie-Ajayi M; Rotkirch A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39087760,"study based on 45 interviews with women aged 55 years and over. women born in the usSR in the 1960s, with the liberalisation of sexual behaviour."
"A cross-sectional study of knowledge, taboos, and attitudes towards menstruation.","The level of knowledge and comprehension surrounding puberty and menstruation. It can substantially impact women's overall health. This cross-sectional study is conducted to get insights about menstrual knowledge, attitudes and taboos among college and university female students in Haryana. A survey was conducted to investigate the experiences of menstruation among female students from government universities and colleges. Respondents were categorized on the basis of age, education qualification, and background setting. Random sampling was used to ensure participation from six administrative zones. The chi-square test was used to determine statistical significance, and the analysis was built around the <i>p</i>-value. The data reveals that there is no significant association between the age of the participants and their awareness of menstruation, scientific knowledge related to menstruation, or their personal relationships with mother, father, or family members. Similarly, there is no significant association between the participants' scientific knowledge and their level of education. However, there is a significant association between participants' personal relationships and level of education (<i>p</i> = .025). Additionally, a significant association was observed between taboos and level of education (<i>p</i> = .025). Age, residential area, and educational levels do not seem to significantly impact participants' awareness and knowledge. This study highlights the influence of personal equations and education on attitudes and beliefs surrounding menstruation. The significant association between personal relationships and education underscores the importance of a supportive family. The persistence of menstrual taboos among undergraduates suggests that there is still a need for comprehensive and inclusive menstrual health education. This study also addressed the sustainable developmental goals for good health and well-being. Future studies should focus on exploring cultural factors such as religious beliefs and cultural norms in more detail to develop interventions that may help improve menstrual health outcomes among college and university students.",['Kumar A; Dhadwal Y; Yadav V; Sharma B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38117236,"cross-sectional study of knowledge, taboos, and attitudes towards menstruation. it is conducted to get insights about menstrual knowledge, attitudes and taboos. it can substantially impact women's overall health."
Menstrual characteristics of sickle cell disease patients seen at a tertiary institution in North Western Nigeria.,"The burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) is high in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, and with improved care and survival, reproductive health issues, including menstruation, have become increasingly important and may impact on long-term health and social wellbeing. This study was carried out to characterize the menstrual characteristics of SCD patients. Using a cross-sectional study design, a semi-structured questionnaire was administered and information collected on bio-demographic data, medical history of SCD, reproductive, and menstrual history. One hundred and sixty female patients participated in the study. The mean age was 24.9 years (standard deviation [SD] ± 8.8). The mean age at menarche was 15.6 years (SD ± 2.7) for those menstruating. Most respondents had regular menstrual cycles 120 (82%); normal menstrual cycle lengths 120 (81%) significantly associated with respondent's age (P < 0.05); normal duration of flow 140 (97%); light menstrual flow 104 (71%) significantly associated with body mass index BMI (P < 0.05). Overall, however, 114 (78%) had abnormal menses and 32 (22%) had normal menses. Eighty-one respondents (56%) experienced menstrual pain, which was severe in only 28 cases (35%). The presence of menstrual pain did not significantly affect the annual frequency of crisis (P > 0.05). The mean age at menarche was high at 15.6 years. Most respondents had light menstrual flow and overall abnormal menstrual patterns. Menstrual pain was common but was not significantly associated with the frequency of crisis.",['Mohammed-Durosinlorun A; Bello-Manga H; Adze J; Ijei IP; Stephen B'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893562,"menstrual characteristics of sickle cell disease patients are high in sub-saharan africa. the burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) is high in sub-saharan africa, including Nigeria."
Potential role of physical labor and cultural views of menstruation in high incidence of pelvic organ prolapse in Nepalese women: a comparative study across the menstrual cycle.,"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a significant health concern for young Nepali women, with potential risk factors including pelvic floor trauma from vaginal delivery and heavy lifting. The prevalence of symptomatic POP (SPOP) among nulliparous women in Nepal is 6%, while the general population of Nepali women aged 15-49 years reports a prevalence of 7%. Surprisingly, the average age of SPOP onset in Nepal is 27 years, challenging the assumption that postmenopausal age and vaginal delivery are the sole risk factors. This study aims to investigate the influence of increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during lifting tasks on pelvic organ descent in Nepali women across different menstrual cycle stages. The study included 22 asymptomatic Nepali women aged 18-30 years who regularly engage in heavy lifting. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured intra-vaginally during typical and simulated lifting tasks, which encompassed various scenarios such as ballistic lifting, ramped lifting, and pre-contraction of pelvic floor muscles, as well as coughing, Valsalva maneuver, and pelvic floor contractions. Pelvic floor displacement was recorded using transperineal ultrasound during menstruation, ovulation, and the mid-luteal phase. Results indicated that pelvic floor displacement was greater during menstruation than ovulation when performing a simulated ballistic lifting task (6.0 ± 1.6 mm vs. 5.1 ± 1.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.03, <i>d</i> = 0.6). However, there was no significant difference in pelvic floor displacement during lifting when the pelvic muscles were pre-contracted. These findings suggest that lifting heavy loads during menstruation may increase the risk of stretching and injuring pelvic floor supportive tissues, potentially contributing to SPOP in young Nepali women. Pre-contracting pelvic floor muscles during lifting tasks may offer a protective effect. Understanding these factors could aid in developing targeted preventive measures and raising awareness about the impact of heavy lifting on pelvic floor health among Nepali women.",['Biswokarma Y; Brandon K; Lohman E; Stafford R; Daher N; Petrofsky J; Thapa U; Berk L; Hitchcock R; Hodges PW'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38487031,symptomatic POP is a significant health concern for young Nepali women. prevalence of symptomatic POP (SPOP) among nulliparous women in Nepal is 6%. the general population of Nepali women aged 15-49 years reports a prevalence of 7%.
Polycystic ovary syndrome: chemical pharmacotherapy.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disease among women of childbearing age. The clinical features are heterogeneous and vary in intensity. Hirsutism, menstrual disorders and infertility are the most frequent conditions observed; however, long-term complications (dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer) are also often described. Each disorder may be managed by tailored strategies, employing sequential or combined pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatment. The authors review the drugs used for PCOS management and discuss new approaches. A systematic MEDLINE search regarding the randomized controlled trials, retrospective and observational studies about medical treatments of PCOS, the Cochrane library for reviews and also search for registered trials on ClinicalTrials.gov is performed. A uniform treatment for PCOS patients does not exist. Clinicians should perform an accurate evaluation of patients' characteristics, identifying the phenotypic target and, subsequently, the best-tailored treatment to manage one or more clinical issues. Lifestyle intervention should always be the first recommended approach unless other issues indicate that drug or hormonal interventions are superior.",['Rocca ML; Venturella R; Mocciaro R; Di Cello A; Sacchinelli A; Russo V; Trapasso S; Zullo F; Morelli M'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001184,"polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disease among women of childbearing age. the clinical features are heterogeneous and vary in intensity. long-term complications (dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer) are also often described."
"Association between public health emergencies and sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence, and early marriage among adolescent girls: a rapid review.","As COVID-19 continues to impact lives and livelihoods around the world, women and girls are disproportionately affected. Crisis situations and related response measures, such as lockdowns, school closures, and travel restrictions, often exacerbate the adversities and human rights violations faced by adolescent girls. We conducted a rapid review to synthesise evidence on the impact of public health emergencies (PHEs) related to gender-based inequalities among adolescent girls. We systematically searched five major databases. Records were imported into the online screening tool Rayyan, and 10% of the records were triple screened for eligibility. We included qualitative, mixed-methods, and quantitative studies that assessed the relationship between PHEs and any of the following outcomes: (1) gender-based violence, (2) early/forced marriage, and (3) sexual and reproductive health. Due to the heterogeneity of included study designs, no meta-analysis was performed, and studies were summarised narratively. Out the initial 6004 articles, 11 studies met our eligibility criteria. Five of these assessed the impact of natural disasters and six were focused on consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven studies focused on the impact of PHEs on gender-based violence, three focused on sexual and reproductive health, and only one study looked at early marriage. The main impacts highlighted by the studies included (1) increases in physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, (2) increase in the occurrence of teenage pregnancy, (3) poor menstruation hygiene management, and (4) occurrence of early marriages. Mechanisms underlying these impacts were PHE-specific response strategies like home confinement, closure of schools, the worsening of families' financial situation such as the inability to pay for school fees or day-to-day living costs, and the disempowerment of and increased workloads for adolescent girls. Although evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health, and especially forced or early marriage of adolescent girls is limited, results from studies on other PHEs indicate that during crises, these detrimental outcomes are exacerbated. Findings from our review have important implications for policies and programs providing life skills training, financial literacy training, credit support, and safe spaces for adolescent girls.",['Shukla S; Ezebuihe JA; Steinert JI'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36650493,"a rapid review of evidence on impact of public health emergencies. the impact of PHEs on gender-based inequalities among adolescent girls. the study included qualitative, mixed-methods, and quantitative studies."
Evaluation of a web-based resource to improve menstrual health literacy and self-management in young women.,"Menstrual cycle-related conditions, such as dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding, are common amongst those under 25 years. Despite having significant impact on work, education, and social activities, most do not seek medical advice, preferring to self-manage their symptoms. We aimed to determine if access to a web-based resource was a feasible and acceptable method for improving menstrual health literacy and encouraging health seeking behavior. People were eligible to participate if they were currently living in Australia, aged 14-25 years, and had menstruated for at least 12 months. Access to the resource, comprising evidence-based information on the menstrual cycle, the Period ImPact and Pain Assessment (PIPPA) tool, and guidance on self-management options, was provided for three menstrual cycles. Seventy-five participants with a mean age of 20.4 years were enrolled with 56 (75%) providing pre and post measures. Recruitment rate and retention rates met pre-specified criteria for feasibility. Eighty five percent of the participants reported the web-based resource was easy to use, and 90% reported they found the information provided 'very helpful'. Just under half (48%) reported the resource changed what they thought was a 'normal' period. Forty-three percent visited their doctor regarding their menstrual symptoms during the study period, with 84% indicating that they made the appointment due to the resource; over half (56%) who visited their doctor received a referral to a gynecologist. Access to a web-based resource on menstrual health literacy was found to be acceptable and feasible to young people and may encourage health-seeking behavior.",['Armour M; Parry K; Curry C; Ferfolja T; Parker MA; Farooqi T; MacMillan F; Smith CA; Holmes K'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36179421,"menstrual cycle-related conditions are common amongst those under 25 years. most do not seek medical advice, preferring to self-manage symptoms. access to the web-based resource was provided for three menstrual cycles."
Compass Rose™ Implementation in a Large Academic Medical Center.,"Compass Rose™, a case management tool developed by Epic®, was designed to track various patient coordination tasks, outreaches, and outcomes. This report describes the implementation of Compass Rose™ within an internal health-system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) and changes in care coordination metrics before and after implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to discuss the implementation of Compass Rose™. The goals of this study were to describe the implementation process of Compass Rose™ at an internal HSSP and compare staff satisfaction before and after Compass Rose™ as the primary outcome. This was an Institutional Review Board exempt, retrospective cohort study conducted between June 2022 to December 2022 that assessed staff satisfaction, refill documentation time, prescription turnaround time, and patient satisfaction pre- and post- Compass Rose™ implementation through survey administration, observed time studies, and internal data reports. The process of Compass Rose™ implementation was also described and discussed. 24 specialty pharmacy staff members participated in the Compass Rose™ implementation survey. No statistically significant differences were observed in either staff satisfaction (3.96 ± 0.95 versus 3.70 ± 0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.29) or predicted versus actual challenge of implementation (3.67 ± 1.17 versus 3.09 ± 0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.064). There was no significant difference in refill documentation time pre- versus post- Compass Rose™ implementation (4.22 ± 3.15 minutes versus 4.10 ± 2.36 minutes, <i>p</i> = 0.82); however, there was a statistically significant increase in prescription turnaround time post implementation (2.59 ± 2.85 days versus 2.69 ± 2.35 days, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Compass Rose™ implementation had no significant impact on staff satisfaction, patient satisfaction, or overall refill documentation time. Prescription turnaround time increased, which could be due to significant workflow changes with Compass Rose™ or several other contributing factors such as increased prescription volume and training new staff during this period.Benefits of Compass Rose™ included standardization of workflow, ability to quantify staff performance and clinical impact, and increased transparency regarding care provided by the specialty pharmacy team.",['Somani S; Takhar S; Miller D; Camarillo H; Zhu M; Tran K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38983636,"Compass RoseTM implementation in a large academic medical center was designed to track patient coordination tasks, outreaches, and outcomes. the report describes the implementation process of Compass RoseTM at an internal health-system specialty pharmacy."

Placental Protein 13 and Syncytiotrophoblast Basement Membrane Ultrastructures in Preeclampsia.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Preeclampsia has been linked to an inflammatory response that may be brought on by endothelial cell dysfunction. This paper investigates the pathomechanism of syncytiotrophoblast basement membrane (STBM) damage and Placental Protein 13 (PP13) release, which may have a role in systemic endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This comparative cross-sectional study involves 54 preeclampsia patients (27 early-onset preeclampsia and 27 late-onset preeclampsia) and 27 pregnant women with normal blood pressure. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate maternal blood levels of PP13. Following birth, a portion of the placenta was collected for transmission electron microscope (TEM) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The data were analyzed using STATA version 15. <i>Results</i>: PP13 expression in the placental syncytiotrophoblast was significantly lower in the early-onset preeclampsia, compared to late-onset preeclampsia and normotensive pregnancy, group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In contrast, serum PP13 levels were found to be the highest in the early-onset preeclampsia group, although no significant difference were found in mean maternal serum levels of PP13 between the three groups. The decreased PP13 expression in placental syncytiotrophoblast can be attributed to the greater extent of damage in the STBM in early-onset preeclampsia that leads to the release of a larger amount of PP13 into maternal circulation. The hypothesis aligns with the TEM analysis results. Preeclamptic pregnancies showed placental syncytiotrophoblast aponeurosis, whereas normotensive pregnancies did not. Placental lesions and STBM shedding were found to be more pronounced in early-onset preeclampsia compared to late-onset preeclampsia. <i>Conclusions</i>: PP13 and STBM damage may play a role in systemic endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia.",['Lestari PM; Wibowo N; Prasmusinto D; Yamin M; Siregar NC; Prihartono J; Timan IS; Mose JC; Liberty IA; Kesty C; Stevanny B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064506,preeclampsia linked to endothelial cell dysfunction.

"Polystyrene nanoplastics induce apoptosis, autophagy, and steroidogenesis disruption in granulosa cells to reduce oocyte quality and fertility by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway in female mice.","Nanoplastics (NPs) are emerging pollutants that pose risks to living organisms. Recent findings have unveiled the reproductive harm caused by polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) in female animals, yet the intricate mechanism remains incompletely understood. Under this research, we investigated whether sustained exposure to PS-NPs at certain concentrations in vivo can enter oocytes through the zona pellucida or through other routes that affect female reproduction. We show that PS-NPs disrupted ovarian functions and decreased oocyte quality, which may be a contributing factor to lower female fertility in mice. RNA sequencing of mouse ovaries illustrated that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway emerged as the predominant environmental information processing pathway responding to PS-NPs. Western blotting results of ovaries in vivo and cells in vitro showed that PS-NPs deactivated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by down-regulating the expression of PI3K and reducing AKT phosphorylation at the protein level, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway which was accompanied by the activation of autophagy and apoptosis and the disruption of steroidogenesis in granulosa cells. Since PS-NPs penetrate granulosa cells but not oocytes, we examined whether PS-NPs indirectly affect oocyte quality through granulosa cells using a granulosa cell-oocyte coculture system. Preincubation of granulosa cells with PS-NPs causes granulosa cell dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in the quality of the cocultured oocytes that can be reversed by the addition of 17β-estradiol. This study provides findings on how PS-NPs impact ovarian function and include transcriptome sequencing analysis of ovarian tissue. The study demonstrates that PS-NPs impair oocyte quality by altering the functioning of ovarian granulosa cells. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the research on the effects of PS-NPs on female reproduction and the related methods that may mitigate their toxicity.",['Xue Y; Cheng X; Ma ZQ; Wang HP; Zhou C; Li J; Zhang DL; Hu LL; Cui YF; Huang J; Luo T; Zheng LP'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39090717,"polystyrene nanoplastics induce apoptosis, autophagy, and steroidogenesis disruption in granulosa cells. the intricate mechanism remains incompletely understood."
"The History of US Menstrual Health, School Nurses, and the Future of Menstrual Health Equity.","In the United States, adolescents suffer from inadequate menstrual health, meaning that adolescents are unprepared for menarche, lack the practical resources they need to comfortably and confidently manage menstruation, and receive inadequate health education and care for menstrual pain and disorders. In this article, we provide a historical analysis of the role of school nurses in addressing menstruation from the early 20th century up to the present day. We contextualize the current realities of school nursing and menstrual health education and clinical support. We argue that the decentralized US school system, a cultural aversion to open discussion about menstruation, and the outsized influence of commercial menstrual product manufacturers have hampered the ability of school nurses to deliver menstrual health education along with menstrual health support. Finally, we discuss implications for today's schooling experiences as well as recommendations for how to support school nurses in aligning our national approach to menstrual health toward the public health perspective of menstrual equity.

Changes in the bile acid pool and timing of female puberty: potential novel role of hypothalamic TGR5.,"The regulation of pubertal timing and reproductive axis maturation is influenced by a myriad of physiologic and environmental inputs yet remains incompletely understood. To contrast differences in bile acid isoform profiles across defined stages of reproductive maturity in humans and a rat model of puberty; to characterize the role of bile acid signaling via hypothalamic expression of bile acid receptor populations in the rodent model. Secondary analysis and pilot studies of clinical cohorts, rodent models, ex vivo analyses of rodent hypothalamic tissues. Bile acid concentrations. Lower circulatory conjugated:deconjugated bile acid concentrations and higher total secondary bile acids were observed in the post-menarcheal versus pre/early-pubertal adolescents, with similar shifts observed in infantile (PN 14) versus early juvenile (PN 21) rats alongside increased tgr5 receptor mRNA expression within the mediobasal hypothalamus of female rats. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the rodent gut microbiome across postnatal life revealed changes in the gut microbial composition predicted to have Bile Salt Hydrolase activity, which was observed in parallel with the increased deconjugated and increased concentrations of secondary bile acids. We show that TGR5-stimulated GnRH release from hypothalamic explants is mediated trough Kisspeptin-receptors and that early overexpression of human-TGR5 within the arcuate nucleus accelerates pubertal onset in female rats. Bile acid isoform shifts along stages of reproductive maturation are conserved across rodents and humans, with pre-clinical models providing mechanistic insight for the neuroendocrine-hepatic-gut microbiome axis as a potential moderator of pubertal timing in females.",['Vanden Brink H; Vandeputte D; Brito IL; Ronnekleiv OK; Roberson MS; Lomniczi A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082696,bile acid isoform profiles across defined stages of reproductive maturity in humans and a rat model of puberty. to characterize the role of bile acid signaling via hypothalamic expression of bile acid receptor populations in the rodent model.
"Sanitation, Stress, and Life Stage: A Systematic Data Collection Study among Women in Odisha, India.","Emerging evidence demonstrates how inadequate access to water and sanitation is linked to psychosocial stress, especially among women, forcing them to navigate social and physical barriers during their daily sanitation routines. We examine sanitation-related psychosocial stress (SRPS) across women's reproductive lives in three distinct geographic sites (urban slums, rural villages, and rural tribal villages) in Odisha, India. We explored daily sanitation practices of adolescent, newly married, pregnant, and established adult women (n = 60) and identified stressors encountered during sanitation. Responding to structured data collection methods, women ranked seven sanitation activities (defecation, urination, menstruation, bathing, post-defecation cleaning, carrying water, and changing clothes) based on stress (high to low) and level of freedom (associated with greatest freedom to having the most restrictions). Women then identified common stressors they encountered when practicing sanitation and sorted stressors in constrained piles based on frequency and severity of each issue. The constellation of factors influencing SRPS varies by life stage and location. Overall, sanitation behaviors that were most restricted (i.e., menstruation) were the most stressful. Women in different sites encountered different stressors, and the level of perceived severity varied based on site and life stage. Understanding the influence of place and life stage on SRPS provides a nuanced understanding of sanitation, and may help identify areas for intervention.",['Hulland KR; Chase RP; Caruso BA; Swain R; Biswal B; Sahoo KC; Panigrahi P; Dreibelbis R'],2015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26551866,sanitation-related psychosocial stress (SRPS) is linked to psychosocial stress. women ranked seven activities based on stress (high to low) and freedom. women sorted stressors in constrained piles based on frequency and severity of each issue.
"A pilot survey of students' menstrual attitudes, experiences, and needs on an urban university campus.","In the United States, many menstruators face barriers to period management, such as period poverty, or the lack of access to relevant knowledge and affordable menstrual products. Our current understanding of the social, emotional, and physical impacts of period poverty on students in post-secondary institutions is largely limited. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess period poverty, period-related class disruption, and avoidance of menstrual hygiene management on campus among students and to identify recommendations for action at the University of Illinois Chicago and other urban universities. An online cross-sectional study from February to May 2023. Enrolled students who were at least 18 years old completed an anonymous, self-administered online survey. Through descriptive statistics and chi-square tests in SAS version 9.4, we analyzed the sociodemographic, academic, and menstrual characteristics of those who had a period in the past 12 months. We also performed a thematic analysis of students' open-ended responses regarding their menstrual experiences on campus. Of our sample (N = 106), 17.1% of students have faced period poverty, 55.8% experienced period-related class disruption, and 47.5% avoided changing their menstrual products on campus. The relationships between the three menstrual experiences were statistically significant. In the open responses, students reported that their personal experiences with menstruation were largely painful and disruptive. We identified the following themes: (1) inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities; (2) understocked, empty, or non-existent menstrual product dispensers; (3) a desire for additional resources for menstruation; and (4) the unpredictability of menstruation. Our findings indicate that students continue to face obstacles to menstruation management due to inadequate support related to menstrual infrastructure, products, and pain.

The prevalence of menstrual cycle symptoms and their association with mental health and sleep in German exercising women and athletes.,"Menstrual cycle symptoms are very common in female athletes. However, more evidence about the association between menstrual cycle characteristics and symptoms with sleep and mental health in athletes needs to be gathered. This study aimed to examine this association in German exercising women and athletes. 322 women (mean age: 23.13 ± 4.36) participated in a cross-sectional study. The survey included the Menstrual Symptom index (MSi), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Athletes Sleep Behavior Questionnaire (ASBQ). Additionally, demographic, sport-specific data and further menstrual cycle characteristics were examined. Multiple regression models were used for the statistical analyses. The MSi score demonstrated a highly significant (p < 0.001) positive association with Depression, Anxiety, Stress, PSQI, and ASBQ. The most prevalent menstrual cycle symptoms were cravings/increased appetite, mood changes/anxiety, and tiredness/fatigue. A difference between individual and team sport athletes could not be found. Moreover, there was no association between the constructs and menses length, irregularity, or heaviness of bleeding. Menstrual cycle symptoms occur very frequently in female athletes. In this study, they were related to mental health, sleep quality, and sleep behavior, regardless of the cycle phase. This evidence demonstrates the relevance of considering the menstrual cycle and menstrual symptoms in future studies with female athletes and in sport practice.",['Kullik L; Stork M; Kiel A; Kellmann M; Jakowski S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503666,menstrual cycle symptoms are very common in female athletes. but more evidence about the association needs to be gathered. menstrual cycle symptoms occur very frequently in female athletes.
Tracking Childhood Lead Exposure in Early Industrial Romanians.,"Childhood lead exposure has been linked to severe adverse health outcomes throughout life. Measurements of lead in teeth have established that individuals living in contaminated environments show higher levels compared to individuals living further away, although less is known about when individuals are most susceptible to these exposures. We examined lead (Pb<sup>208</sup>) concentrations (ppm) in teeth over the first 2.5 years of life in 16 children born in the late 19<sup>th</sup> to early 20<sup>th</sup> century throughout Romania. This period of intense industrialization was characterized by increases in mining, coal burning, and oil refining-activities that contaminate air, water, and food with Pb. We hypothesized the distance from an operational mine or oil refinery, or being born in a city, would be positively associated with cumulative dentine Pb exposure (CDPE). We also predicted that Pb exposures would peak in the first six months of life when gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of Pb is likely highest. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of sectioned tooth dentine followed by Bayesian statistical analyses revealed that living 30 km or more from a mine or oil refinery did not explain CDPE. However, being born in a city explained 42% of CDPE. All individuals showed maximum Pb exposures after six months of age, likely due to contaminated solid food and/or non-milk liquids. This research demonstrates how tooth formation can be coupled with comprehensive elemental mapping to analyse the context and timing of early-life neurotoxicant exposures, which may be extended to well-preserved teeth from clinical and historic populations.",['Bharatiya M; Austin C; Arora M; Feeney RNM; Leonard ND; Low-Choy S; Paul B; Soficaru AD; Zhao JX; Smith TM'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39067821,study of lead concentrations in teeth found that individuals living in contaminated environments show higher levels compared to individuals living further away. study was carried out in 16 children born in the late 19sup>th/sup> to early 20sup>th/sup> century throughout Romania.
Urinary and reproductive tract infection symptoms and menstrual hygiene practices in refugee camps in Jordan: A cross-sectional study.,"Urinary tract infections and reproductive tract infections pose significant health risks, particularly among women living in challenging conditions. Unhygienic menstrual practices can exacerbate these risks, impacting physical and psychological well-being. This study assessed the association between unhygienic menstrual care and self-reported urinary tract infection/reproductive tract infection symptoms among refugee women. In addition, it explored the association between these symptoms and mental health, specifically depressive symptoms. This study adopted a cross-sectional observational design. This study was conducted between January and March 2023, involving 387 reproductive-age refugee women. Data collected included sociodemographic information and urinary tract infection/reproductive tract infection symptoms. In addition, we used the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale to evaluate menstrual hygiene practices and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depressive symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using Python version 3.9.12. Of 387 refugee women, 92.25% reported having urinary or reproductive tract infection symptoms in the previous 3 months. Factors like older age (odds ratio = 1.764, 95% confidence interval = 1.083-2.873, p-value = 0.023), lower family income (odds ratio = 0.327, 95% confidence interval = 0.138-0.775, p-value = 0.011), lower educational level (odds ratio = 0.222, 95% confidence interval = 0.068-0.718, p-value = 0.012), and being married (odds ratio = 0.328, 95% confidence interval = 0.188-0.574, p-value < 0.001) were significantly associated with urinary or reproductive tract infection risk. Difficulties obtaining menstrual products and thus reusing them increased the odds of urinary or reproductive tract infection diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.452, 95% confidence interval = 1.497-4.015, p-value < 0.001). Women with urinary or reproductive tract infection symptoms exhibited higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores than those without (12.14 ± 5.87 vs 9.99 ± 5.86, p-value < 0.001, respectively). This study highlights a high prevalence of urinary or reproductive tract infection symptoms among refugee women residing in camps in Jordan, which was associated with poor menstrual hygiene practices and depressive symptoms. To reduce the urinary tract infection/reproductive tract infection burden in marginalized communities, public health initiatives should enhance healthcare accessibility, provide reproductive education, and promote holistic well-being practices for refugee women.",['Al Karmi J; Alshrouf MA; Haddad TA; Alhanbali AE; Raiq NA; Ghanem H; Ibrahim OB; Khamis T; Muhaidat N'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38576125,"study assessed association between unhygienic menstrual care and self-reported urinary tract infection/reproductive tract infection symptoms among refugee women. study was conducted between January and March 2023, involving 387 reproductive-age refugee women."
Impact of COVID-19 infections and vaccination on menstrual cycle symptoms in the south of Jordan: a cross-sectional study.,"Several recent studies have highlighted the need for more evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 infections and vaccines on the reproductive system and menstruation. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection and vaccines on menstrual symptoms. A cross-sectional survey utilizing face-to-face interviews from January 1 to 31 March 2022 was conducted in the city of Al-Karak in southern Jordan. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, the contraceptive method used if any, menstrual cycle (MC) status, previous medical and drug history, and the impact of infection and vaccination on the MC. The study questionnaire was completed by 400 participants with a mean age of 32.1±12.6 years. Regarding the history of COVID-19 infections, 33.8% of the participants reported a history of confirmed COVID-19 infections, 77.8% of them did not report any menstrual changes following the infection, while the remaining 22.2% reported changes in menstruation. The most commonly reported post-COVID-19 manifestations were irregular (27.6%) and light menstrual cycle (MC) (24.15) or dysmenorrhea (24.1%). Heavy menstruation was reported by 17.2% of participants post-COVID-19 infection. Two-thirds of the study participants (66.6%) reported no changes in the MC following the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. The most reported symptoms for those who experienced changes in the MC following the vaccination were irregular cycle (13.1%), heavy menstruation (7%), and light menstruation (7%). Other reported symptoms were dysmenorrhea (4.6%), intermenstrual bleeding (1.2%), and amenorrhea (0.5%).

Dysmenorrhea in adolescents.,"Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1-3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.",['Gutman G; Nunez AT; Fisher M'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35523674,between 41% and 91.5% of young women are affected by dysmenorrhea. primary dysmenorrhea is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation.
White matter pathways associated with empathy in females: A DTI investigation.,"Empathy is a component of social cognition that allows us to understand, perceive, experience, and respond to the emotional state of others. In this study, we seek to build on previous research that suggests that sex and hormone levels may impact white matter microstructure. These white matter microstructural differences may influence social cognition. We examine the fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter pathways associated with the complex human process of empathy in healthy young adult females during the self-reported luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. We used tract-based spatial statistics to perform statistical comparisons of FA and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to examine the strength of association between white matter FA and scores on the Empathy Quotient (EQ), a self-report questionnaire in which individuals report how much they agree or disagree with 60 statements pertaining to their empathic tendencies. Results identified a significant negative relationship between EQ scores and FA within five clusters of white matter: in the left forceps minor/body of the corpus callosum, left corticospinal tract, intraparietal sulcus/primary somatosensory cortex, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus/forceps minor. These consistent findings across clusters suggest that lower self-reported empathy is related to higher FA across healthy young females in specific white matter regions during the menstrual luteal phase. Future research should seek to examine if self-reported empathy varies across the menstrual cycle, using blood samples to confirm cycle phase and hormone levels.",['Steinberg SN; Tedla NB; Hecht E; Robins DL; King TZ'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36007350,white matter microstructure may influence social cognition. sex and hormone levels may influence white matter microstructure.

Exploring Black-White Differences in the Relationship Between Inflammation and Timing of Menopause.,"Understanding the biosocial context of menopausal timing offers insight into social and health inequalities. Prior research on inflammatory chronic conditions suggests that inflammation may predict how early women experience menopause. We explore the ability of black race to moderate the overall relationship between chronic inflammation and timing of menopause. We use data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project on inflammation, age of last menstruation, and race as well as relevant social and medical covariates. We conduct event history modeling to predict age at menopause by inflammatory biomarker levels. Using interaction analysis, we investigate whether being black may shape the overall relationship between inflammation status and menopause timing. Our analyses find no significant statistical interactions between black race and inflammation in predicting menopausal onset. However, we do identify independent correlational relationships between inflammation and black race (r = 0.136) and between menopausal timing and black race (r = -0.129) as well as inflammation (r = -0.138) that emerge as significant in corresponding regression models. We conclude that race probably does not moderate associations between inflammation and menopause. Yet, we also note that the original parameter estimate for black race's impact on menopausal onset (HR = 1.29, p < 0.05) becomes non-significant in a model that includes inflammation (HR = 1.06, p < 0.01). To translate our findings into policy and practice implications, we present alternate conceptualizations of black-white disparity in the inflammation-menopause relationship and recommend future research using mediation modeling.",['Nowakowski ACH; Graves KY'],2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27287275,"prior research on inflammatory chronic conditions suggests that inflammation may predict how early women experience menopause. we use data from the national social life, health, and Aging Project on inflammation, age of last menstruation, and race."
Transgender persons and structural intersectionality: Towards menstrual justice for all menstruators in India.,"Government policies concerning access to menstrual hygiene primarily focus on adolescent girls and women, leaving out transgender individuals. Addressing access to menstrual hygiene for transgender persons will require two key steps: first, their inclusion in current policies, and second, framing additional policies to address specific needs. Due to the absence of specific studies on this subject, this commentary relies on personal narratives and international studies. Improving access to menstrual hygiene among transgender individuals will require the enhancing of the availability of menstrual hygiene products, mitigating of stigma and fear of harassment, sensitising of healthcare workers, and ensuring the availability of proper washrooms. In addition, addressing the menstrual injustice experienced by transgender persons involves addressing socioeconomic factors such as caste, poverty, and access to education. Using the lens of structural intersectionality, this article undertakes a review of oppressive systems causing menstrual injustice. This approach is intended to enable policymakers and researchers to consider the multifaceted identities of menstruators, fostering a holistic understanding that will inform their approach towards achieving menstrual equality.",['Tibrewala M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38755765,addressing access to menstrual hygiene for transgender individuals will require enhancing access to menstrual hygiene products. this article undertakes a review of oppressive systems causing menstrual injustice.
"Spa therapy (balneotherapy) relieves mental stress, sleep disorder, and general health problems in sub-healthy people.","To investigate the relieving effects of hot spring balneotherapy on mental stress, sleep disorder, general health problems, and women's health problems in sub-healthy people, we recruited 500 volunteers in sub-health in Chongqing, and 362 volunteers completed the project, including 223 in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. The intervention group underwent hot spring balneotherapy for 5 months, while the control group did not. The two groups took questionnaire investigation (general data, mental stress, emotional status, sleep quality, general health problems, as well as some women's health problems) and physical examination (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipid, blood sugar) 5 months before and after the intervention, respectively. After intervention, sleep disorder (difficulty in falling asleep (P = 0.017); dreaminess, nightmare suffering, and restless sleep (P = 0.013); easy awakening (P = 0.003) and difficulty in falling into sleep again after awakening(P = 0.016); and mental stress (P = 0.031) and problems of general health (head pain (P = 0.026), joint pain(P = 0.009), leg or foot cramps (P = 0.001), blurred vision (P = 0.009)) were relieved significantly in the intervention group, as compared with the control group. While other indicators (fatigue, eye tiredness, limb numbness, constipation, skin allergy) and women's health problems (breast distending pain; dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation) were relieved significantly in the self-comparison of the intervention group before and after intervention (P < 0.05), but showed no statistically significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). All indications (except bad mood, low mood, and worry or irritability) in the intervention group significantly improved, with effect size from 0.096 to 1.302. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency, length, and location of balneotherapy in the intervention group were the factors influencing emotion, sleep, and health condition (P < 0.05). Relief of insomnia, fatigue, and leg or foot cramps was greater in old-age group than in young-aged group (P < 0.05). Physical examination found that waist circumferences in women of various ages under 55 years were significantly reduced in the intervention group (P < 0.05), while that in men did not significantly change (P > 0.05).

"Daidzein, but not genistein, has anxiolytic-liked effect on intact male Wistar rats.","The phytoestrogens daidzein and genistein are ubiquitous in human food. This study aimed to elucidate their anxiety-liked effects, their effects on the reproductive organs, and the molecular mechanism behind any anxiety-liked effects in intact adult male Wistar rats. These phytoestrogens are of interest due to their posited health benefits, particularly for female, but with some effect on males as well. This study comprised two experiments: (1) Male Wistar rats received either a vehicle, daidzein, or genistein (0.25, 0.50, or 1.00mg/kg) by subcutaneously injection for four weeks. They were then tested for anxiety-liked behaviors. Then, the brain monoamines in anxiolytic rats were determined; (2) The modulation of gamma aminobutyric acid receptors by phytoestrogens was further analyzed by administration of diazepam to phytoestrogen-treated rats before behavioral tests. In the first experiment, the biological parameters measured, including body weight, daily food intake and reproductive organ weights were unaffected by either genistein or daidzein. However, anxiolytic-like effect was observed in the low-dose daidzein (0.25mg/kg) group. Higher doses of daidzein or genistein of all doses had no effect. Further, the low-dose daidzein did not alter brain monoamine levels. In the second experiment, the anxiolytic-like behavior of daidzein-treated rats receiving diazepam did not differ from that of the rats treated with just diazepam or just daidzein. In conclusion, 4-week exposure to daidzein or genistein had no negative effects on the reproductive organs, body weight, food intake, anxiogenic-like behavior, or monoaminergic and diazepam-modulated GABAergic neurotransmissions of intact male rats. However, beneficial anxiolytic-like effects were apparent after low-dose treatment with daidzein.",['Kalandakanond-Thongsong S; Daendee S; Thongsong B; Srikiatkhachorn A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39094955,"phytoestrogens daidzein and genistein are ubiquitous in human food. they are of interest due to their posited health benefits, particularly for female. but with some effect on males as well."
Evaluation of a menstrual hygiene intervention in urban and rural schools in Bangladesh: a pilot study.,"Girls' menstrual experiences impact their social and educational participation, physical and psychological health. We conducted a pilot study to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component intervention intended to support menstruating girls; improve menstrual care knowledge, practices, and comfort; and increase school attendance.We conducted a pre/post evaluation of a 6-month pilot intervention in four schools (2 urban, 2 rural) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected 527 schoolgirls (grades 5 to 10; aged 10 to 17 years) for a baseline survey and 528 girls at endline. The intervention included: 1) Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) packs- reusable cloth pads, underwear, carry bags and menstrual cycle tracking calendars, 2) education curriculum- pictorial flipcharts, puberty related-booklets, and teachers' training to deliver puberty and MHM sessions, 3) maintenance- improvements to school sanitation, provision of disposable pads in the school office, provision of chute disposal systems for disposable pads, and gender committees to promote a gender-friendly school environment and maintenance of intervention facilities. We estimated intervention uptake and intervention effect by calculating prevalence differences and 95% confidence intervals using fixed-effects logistic regression.The intervention uptake was more than 85% for most indicators; 100% reported receiving puberty education, 85% received MHM packs, and 92% received booklets. Reusable cloth pads uptake was 34% by endline compared with 0% at baseline. Knowledge about menstrual physiology and knowledge of recommended menstrual management practices significantly improved from baseline to endline. Reported improvements included more frequent changing of menstrual materials (4.2 times/day at endline vs. 3.4 times/day at baseline), increased use of recommended disposal methods (prevalence difference (PD): 8%; 95% Confidence Interval: 1, 14), and fewer staining incidents (PD: - 12%; 95% CI: - 22, - 1). More girls reported being satisfied with their menstrual materials (59% at endline vs. 46% at baseline, p < 0.005) and thought school facilities were adequate for menstrual management at endline compared to baseline (54% vs. 8%, p < 0.001). At endline, 64% girls disagreed/strongly disagreed that they felt anxious at school due to menstruation, compared to 33% at baseline (p < 0.001). Sixty-five percent girls disagreed/strongly disagreed about feeling distracted or trouble concentrating in class at endline, compared to 41% at baseline (p < 0.001). Self-reported absences decreased slightly (PD: - 8%; 95% CI: - 14, - 2).Uptake of cloth pads, improved maintenance and disposal of menstrual materials, and reduced anxiety at school suggest acceptability and feasibility of the intervention aiming to create a supportive school environment.",['Alam MU; Sultana F; Hunter EC; Winch PJ; Unicomb L; Sarker S; Mahfuz MT; Al-Masud A; Rahman M; Luby SP'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35655267,menstrual hygiene intervention in urban and rural schools in Bangladesh. study assessed acceptability and feasibility of multi-component intervention. intervention included: a menstrual hygiene management pack.
Perceived associations between the menstrual cycle and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): A qualitative interview study exploring lived experiences.,"The research gap regarding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in people who were assigned female at birth has led to a lack of knowledge and adequate approaches in clinical practice, as well as diagnosis processes. Recent studies report potential associations between reproductive hormones and ADHD, but existing research remains scarce. This study aims to explore the experiences of people who perceive an association between their menstrual cycle and their ADHD symptoms. Design and Method. A qualitative research design with an inductive approach was used. Ten participants were interviewed, using semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The data was transcribed, coded, and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke. Findings show participant's perceived associations between their ADHD and their menstrual cycle: participants reported experiencing ADHD symptom mor severe during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Other results showed uncertainty around ADHD medication in relation to the cycle and varied experiences with health care encounters as well as heightened challenged around menstrual health management. This study provides insights to how perceived associations between ADHD and the menstrual cycle might be experienced. This report highlights the need for further research and theory about the potential associations between ADHD and reproductive hormones. The researchers strongly suggested that forthcoming ADHD studies consider times of key hormonal changes, such as puberty and menarche, menopause, hormonal birth control, pregnancy, hormone treatment, and more.",['Bürger I; Erlandsson K; Borneskog C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38678676,study explores the experiences of people who perceive an association between their menstrual cycle and their ADHD symptoms. study aims to explore the experiences of people who perceive an association between their menstrual cycle and their ADHD symptoms.
Varied cellular abnormalities in thin vs. normal endometrium in recurrent implantation failure by single-cell transcriptomics.,"Reduced endometrium thickness and receptivity are two important reasons for recurrent implantation failure (RIF). In order to elucidate differences between these two types of endometrial defects in terms of molecular signatures, cellular interactions, and structural changes, we systematically investigated the single-cell transcriptomic atlas across three distinct groups: RIF patients with thin endometrium (≤ 6 mm, TE-RIF), RIF patients with normal endometrium thickness (≥ 8 mm, NE-RIF), and fertile individuals (Control). The late proliferative and mid-secretory phases of the endometrium were collected from three individuals in the TE-RIF group, two in the NE-RIF group, and three in the control group. The study employed a combination of advanced techniques. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to capture comprehensive transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell level, providing insights into gene expression patterns within specific cell types. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were employed to visualize ultrastructural details of the endometrial tissue, while hematoxylin and eosin staining facilitated the examination of tissue morphology and cellular composition. Immunohistochemistry techniques were also applied to detect and localize specific protein markers relevant to endometrial receptivity and function. Through comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes among these groups and KEGG pathway analysis, the TE-RIF group exhibited notable dysregulations in the TNF and MAPK signaling pathways, which are pivotal in stromal cell growth and endometrial receptivity. Conversely, in the NE-RIF group, disturbances in energy metabolism emerged as a primary contributor to reduced endometrial receptivity. Additionally, using CellPhoneDB for intercellular communication analysis revealed aberrant interactions between epithelial and stromal cells, impacting endometrial receptivity specifically in the TE-RIF group. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the heterogeneous molecular pathways and cellular interactions associated with RIF in different endometrial conditions. These insights may pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at improving endometrial receptivity and enhancing reproductive outcomes in patients undergoing ART. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and translate them into clinical applications for personalized fertility treatments.

'Le moment de la lune'. an auto-ethnographic tale of practice about menarche in a children's hospital.,"Auto-ethnographic accounts can highlight unsaid moments of professional practice. In this case, my auto-ethnographic tale 'Le moment de la lune' re-inscribes subjugated knowledge about menstruation and occupational therapy practice in the era before adolescent wards. This fictional tale is written in direct dialogue with an article that was published in this journal at a particular point in my own career as an occupational therapist. In the tale I am 'writing in' what was not written about in my article and in occupational therapy generally. This 'writing-in'/re-inscribing is the research method. My previous article 'Normal spaces' published in this journal in 1985, was organised around principles and generalities of youth-specific practice. The original article had little locating the personal or evoking the body and a heavy reliance on the literature. Issues of gender and culture were largely absent, or, perhaps, 'written out'. The corresponding tale of embodied sexuality, 'Le moment de la lune', articulates something of local complex practice and the particularity of individual therapeutic work to do with menstruation in self-care. Points of tension in 'Normal spaces' are elaborated and I explain how 'Le moment de la lune' problematises supporting menarche in a children's hospital. Now practice has moved on with dedicated adolescent wards in all major children's hospitals. Nevertheless, occupational therapy practice around issues of menstrual self-management is still under-documented. Writing about unspoken moments of practice can have ethical implications for expanding the ways occupational therapy practice can be written and understood.",['Denshire S'],2011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21770962,auto-ethnographic tale 'Le moment de la lune' re-inscribes subjugated knowledge about menstruation and occupational therapy practice in the era before adolescent wards.
Female Athletes and the Menstrual Cycle in Team Sports: Current State of Play and Considerations for Future Research.,"Over the past ten years there has been a dramatic rise in female sport participation and accompanying female professional national leagues across multiple sports, yet research has not followed suit. Although there are known variations between female and male physiology, training protocols in female sport are predominantly underpinned by research undertaken in male athletes. The hormonal variability experienced by women across the menstrual cycle, as well as the menstrual cycle variability between women, may contribute to the complexity of conducting rigorous physiological studies, leading to a paucity of robust sports-specific research that can be confidently applied to female athletes. Moreover, barriers exist in female sport that potentially limit the ability to conduct research, including the lack of full-time programs and limited resources. Recently, there has been increased interest in the potential effects of fluctuations in the female sex hormones, progesterone and oestrogen, on sport performance across different phases of the menstrual cycle. However, current research evaluating the menstrual cycle and physical performance (such as strength, speed, aerobic fitness, and athletes' perception of their performance) have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, methodological design across studies has shown little consistency, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions, which potentially prevents female athletes optimising their physical and sporting performance. It further impacts coaches and sports science researchers in their ability to provide appropriate training recommendations and educational opportunities. It is important to progress in female athlete research with an understanding of how the unique physiology of female athletes may influence their ability to physically perform in their respective sport, which requires representation in sports science research. This paper will provide an overview on current evidence and limitations within menstrual cycle research and provide considerations and directions for future research in this space within team sports.",['Vogel K; Larsen B; McLellan C; Bird SP'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38275983,research has not followed suit in the past 10 years. there has been a dramatic rise in female sport participation across multiple sports. but research has not followed suit.
Utilization of modern menstrual methods and related unmet needs among college going women in Coimbatore district: a descriptive cross-sectional study.,"The primary objectives were to determine the proportion of modern menstrual method (MMM) users among college going women in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu; and to estimate the unmet needs associated with use of MMMs in comparison with other menstrual hygiene methods (MHMs). We also assessed the factors that determine MMM use among college going women. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among college going women in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India between October 2022 and January 2023 using a purpose predesigned, pretested, semi-structured proforma that included validated Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36). Only 1.4% of the study participants used MMMs - menstrual cups (1.3%) and tampons (0.1%). Sanitary pads were the most common MHM of choice (96.3%); of which majority (98.6%) used disposable pads and more than half (50.4%) used non-biodegradable pads. Importantly, one in six (16.5%) were not aware of nature of sanitary pads (biodegradable or nonbiodegradable) used. The unmet needs associated with MMMs (menstrual cups and tampons) were significantly lower than that for other MHMs (including sanitary pads), in particular, the unmet material and home environment needs, unmet material reliability concerns, unmet reuse needs and unmet reuse insecurity. However, we found no significant difference between MMMs, sanitary pads and other MHMs in terms of unmet transport, college environment, change and disposal insecurity needs. The significant predictors of use of MMMs were age (more than 21 years of age), residence (urban), type of stay (off campus including home), socioeconomic status (upper), fathers' and mothers' education (high school and above), and presence of personal income. Discussions with friends (or peers) both before and after menarche regarding menstruation resulted in higher adoption of modern menstrual methods. MMMs provided comparative advantage with lesser unmet needs for material reliability and reuse insecurity concerns, particularly in home environment. However, none of the MHMs fulfilled the user expectations for transport and disposal insecurity concerns, particularly outdoors.",['Durairaj T; Aparnavi P; Narayanan S; Mahantshetti S; Dhandapani S; Shanmugam J; Rathinamoorthy R; Kumar M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38291382,"descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among college going women in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India between October 2022 and January 2023. the primary objectives were to determine the proportion of modern menstrual method (MMM) users among college going women in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu."
Ovarian endometrioma: a report of a pediatric case diagnosed prior to menstruation.,"Ovarian endometriomas (OEs) are rarely found in the pediatric population, especially before menstruation. We report a 6-year-old girl who was postoperatively diagnosed with OE before menstruation. A 6-year-old girl presented to a local pediatrician with abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a multilocular cystic lesion to the left of the bladder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed similar findings, with the contents of the cyst showing a low signal on T1-weighted imaging and a high signal on T2-weighted imaging. The patient was referred to our institution for further examination. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a multilocular cystic lesion sized 56 × 44 × 30 mm with partial calcification. The left ovarian vein was dilated, suggesting the origin of the tumor to be the left ovary. Extirpation of the lesion was performed under laparoscopic assistance. Pathological findings indicated an ovarian endometrioma. To our knowledge, this is the youngest report of an OE diagnosed in a patient prior to menstruation. OEs in children before menstruation are extremely rare; thus, the long-term prognosis is yet to be determined.",['Takada L; Kawano T; Yano K; Iwamoto Y; Ogata M; Kedoin C; Murakami M; Sugita K; Onishi S; Muto M; Kirishima M; Tanimoto A; Ieiri S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38898208,a 6-year-old girl was diagnosed with OE before menstruation. a 6-year-old girl presented to a local pediatrician with abdominal pain and vomiting. a multilocular cystic lesion was revealed to the left of the bladder.
Effect of Menstrual Cycle Phase on Perceived Exertion During Aerobic Exercise in Eumenorrheic Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a readily available and practical tool widely used in exercise science to monitor exercise load, but a rigorous review of the effect of menstrual cycle (MC) phases on RPE within continuous aerobic exercise has not yet been completed. This study investigated the effects of the MC phase on RPE during aerobic exercise. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. The search strategy was carried out using the 5 most common scientific databases. While qualitative analyses were performed in all included studies, random effects to standard mean difference were calculated and meta-analysis was performed where possible. This study addresses comparison for RPE at the beginning, middle, and end of the exercise adopting 2 mains analysis. The first adopted early cycle (first session of the cycle) as control compared with the subsequent phases, and the second adopted days 1 to 5 (early follicular) as control compared with the subsequent phases. A total of 17 studies (n = 160) were included in the qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that MC phases did not impact RPE (<i>P</i> > .05).

Long-Term Outcomes of the Restoration of Uterovaginal Continuity and Vaginoplasty-Utero-Colo-Neovaginoplasty-in Cervicovaginal Agenesis Using the Sigmoid Colon.,"Congenital cervicovaginal agenesis in the presence of a functional endometrium is a rare Müllerian anomaly. The management ranges from hysterectomy historically to various reconstructive procedures more recently. We report our experience with utero-colo-vaginoplasty in the management of this anomaly and its long-term follow-up. The case records of all the patients with vaginal or cervicovaginal agenesis in our hospital from January 2002 to December 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were then called for an outpatient visit and examined in detail. The anatomical variations, surgical procedures and outcomes were recorded and analysed. Sixteen patients aged 14 to 26 years were included during the study period. They presented with cyclical painful cryptomenorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed cervicovaginal or distal vaginal agenesis. All the patients underwent utero-colo-vaginoplasty. Intraoperative rectal injury led to post-operative faecal leak from the perineal wound in one patient in the post-operative period. Restoration of painless menstrual flow was possible in all 16 cases. Long-term complications were seen in 4 patients. These were stenosis of the perineal neovaginal orifice in 2 patients, obstruction at colo-uterine anastomosis in 1 patient and mucosal prolapse at the neovagina in 1 patient. Three of these patients needed secondary surgical procedures. Five were sexually active and reported consummation of penetrative intercourse. None of them had conceived. In our experience, utero-colo-vaginoplasty allows for regular painless menstruation and coitus with minimal long-term complications.

The impact of treatment for childhood classical Hodgkin lymphoma according to the EuroNet-PHL-C2 protocol on serum anti-Müllerian Hormone.,"What is the impact of the EuroNet-PHL-C2 treatment protocol for children with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) on gonadal function in girls, based on assessment of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)? Serum AMH levels decreased after induction chemotherapy and increased during subsequent treatment and 2 years of follow-up, with lowest levels in patients treated for advanced stage cHL. Treatment for cHL, particularly alkylating agents and pelvic irradiation, can be gonadotoxic and result in premature reduction of primordial follicles in females. The current EuroNet-PHL-C2 trial aims to reduce the use of radiotherapy in standard childhood cHL treatment, by intensifying chemotherapy. This study aims to assess the gonadotoxic effect of the EuroNet-PHL-C2 protocol. This international, prospective, multicenter cohort study is embedded in the EuroNet-PHL-C2 trial, an European phase-3 treatment study evaluating the efficacy of standard cHL treatment with OEPA-COPDAC-28 (OEPA: vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and doxorubicin; COPDAC-28: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and dacarbazine) versus intensified OEPA-DECOPDAC-21 (DECOPDAC-21: COPDAC with additional doxorubicin and etoposide and 25% more cyclophosphamide) in a randomized setting. Participants were recruited between January 2017 and September 2021. Female patients aged ≤18 years, treated according to the EuroNet-PHL-C2 protocol for cHL were recruited across 18 sites in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Czech Republic. All parents and patients (aged ≥12 years old) provided written informed consent. Serum AMH levels and menstrual cycle characteristics were evaluated over time (at diagnosis, one to three times during treatment and 2 up to 5 years post-diagnosis) and compared between treatment-levels (TL1, TL2, and TL3) and treatment-arms (OEPA-COPDAC-28 and OEPA-DECOPDAC-21). Serum samples obtained from patients after receiving pelvic radiotherapy were excluded from the main analyses. A total of 104 females, with median age at diagnosis of 15.6 years (IQR 13.7; 17.0), were included in the analysis. Ninety-nine were (post)pubertal. Eighteen girls were diagnosed with an early stage of cHL (TL1) and 86 with intermediate or advanced stage disease (50 TL2 and 36 TL3, 66% received COPDAC-28 and 34% DECOPDAC-21). Five patients received pelvic radiotherapy. Median AMH level at diagnosis was 1.7 µg/l (IQR 0.9; 2.7). After two courses of OEPA chemotherapy, AMH levels decreased substantially in all patients (98% <0.5 µg/l), followed by a significant increase during the consolidation treatment and follow-up. After 2 years, 68% of patients reached their baseline AMH value, with overall median recovery of 129% (IQR 75.0; 208.9) compared to baseline measurement. Five patients (7%) had AMH <0.5 µg/l. In patients treated for advanced stage disease, AMH levels remained significantly lower compared to early- or intermediate stage disease, with median serum AMH of 1.3 µg/l (IQR 0.8; 2.1) after 2 years. Patients who received DECOPDAC-21 consolidation had lower AMH levels during treatment than patients receiving COPDAC-28, but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 2 years post-diagnosis. Of the 35 postmenarchal girls who did not receive hormonal co-treatment, 19 (54%) experienced treatment-induced amenorrhea, two girls had persisting amenorrhea after 2 years. The studied population comprises young girls with diagnosis of cHL often concurring with pubertal transition, during which AMH levels naturally rise. There was no control population, while the interpretation of AMH as a biomarker during childhood is complex. The state of cHL disease may affect AMH levels at diagnosis, potentially complicating assessment of AMH recovery as a comparison with baseline AMH. The current analysis included data up to 2-5 years post-diagnosis. The current PANCARE guideline advises to use the cyclophosphamide-equivalent dose score (CED-score, as an estimation of cumulative alkylating agent exposure) with a cut-off of 6000 mg/m2 to identify females aged <25 years at high risk of infertility. All treatment-arms of the EuroNet-PHL-C2 protocol remain below this cut-off, and based on this guideline, girls treated for cHL should therefore be considered low-risk of infertility. However, although we observed an increase in AMH after chemotherapy, it should be noted that not all girls recovered to pre-treatment AMH levels, particularly those treated for advanced stages of cHL. It remains unclear how our measurements relate to age-specific expected AMH levels and patterns. Additional (long-term) data are needed to explore clinical reproductive outcomes of survivors treated according to the EuroNet-PHL-C2 protocol. The fertility add-on study was funded by the Dutch charity foundation KiKa (project 257) that funds research on all forms of childhood cancer. C.M-K., D.K., W.H.W., D.H., M.C., A.U., and A.B. were involved in the development of the EuroNet-PHL-C2 regimen. The other authors indicated no potential conflicts of interest.

Prevalence of premenstrual syndrome and its effect on quality of work life in working women in South India.,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical and affective symptoms that start during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and improve on the onset of the menstrual cycle. The estimated prevalence in India of PMS is found to be 43%, but most studies have been done on adolescent and college-going females. There is a dearth of studies in India done on PMS in working women. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome in working women and determine its association with the quality of their work life. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Kochi and five different groups of professional women were included in the sample population. A total of 600 participants were analyzed for sociodemographic data, premenstrual syndrome using the premenstrual symptoms screening tool and quality of their work life using the work-related quality of life scale. Chi-square test was applied to find the association of categorical demographic parameters with premenstrual syndrome and with quality of work life in women satisfying the criteria for PMS. A total of 48% of the participants screened positive for PMS and 35% of working women with PMS had lower quality of work life (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Highest educational qualification, occupation, and sexual activity were significantly associated with PMS and with quality of work life in women with PMS. There is a high prevalence of PMS in working women, which significantly affects their quality of work life. There is a need for further research in this area that can propel improvement in policies in the workplace to boost productivity and growth.",['Maheshwari P; Menon B; Jith A; Bhaskaran R'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38161484,premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical and affective symptoms. symptoms start during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. estimated prevalence in india of PMS is 43%. most studies have been done on adolescent and college-going females.
Almotriptan: meeting today's needs in acute migraine treatment.,"Migraine is a common disorder associated with considerable individual and economic burden. Triptans are recommended for the treatment of migraine of any severity in patients who have failed to gain adequate relief with nonspecific medication; early transition to triptans avoids prolonged morbidity in patients failing to respond to nonspecific medications. There is evidence that early intervention therapy with oral formulations in migraine, soon after the onset of an attack and when pain is still mild, improves efficacy. Seven different triptans are currently marketed, with differing pharmacologic, efficacy and tolerability profiles. Almotriptan has many positive features, which include rigorously demonstrated efficacy in sumatriptan nonresponders, as early therapy and in menstrual migraine. In addition, almotriptan has a favorable pharmacologic profile with a lack of clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interventions with other drugs, adverse reactions rate similar to placebo, superior cost-effectiveness and excellent performance on composite clinical outcome measures that incorporate features of greatest importance to patients. Although effective in both triptan-naive and -experienced patients, and as both early and standard therapy, almotriptan shows greater efficacy in triptan-naive patients and as early treatment, and is consistently one of the preferred triptans in multiattribute decision-making analyses incorporating attributes of significance for patients and physicians. Therefore, almotriptan has many features that make it an ideal choice for a triptan-naive patient moving from nonspecific medication, a patient switching from another triptan owing to inefficacy or tolerability issues and patients being advised to take a triptan early in the course of a migraine attack.",['Láinez MJ'],2007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18052762,"almotriptan has many positive features, including pharmacologic, efficacy and tolerability profiles. almotriptan is a preferred triptan in multiattribute decision-making analyses."
Clinicopathological differences and survival benefit in ER+/PR+/HER2+ vs ER+/PR-/HER2+ breast cancer subtypes.,"Breast cancer subtypes based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression have significant implications for prognosis. HER2-positive tumors historically demonstrated poorer survival, but anti-HER2 targeted therapy improved outcomes. However, hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients may experience reduced benefit due to HER2-HR signaling crosstalk. Data from two databases, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Breast Cancer Data Base (SJTUBCDB) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, were analyzed. Propensity score adjustments were used to balance patient characteristics between ER+/PR+/HER2+ and ER+/PR-/HER2+ subtypes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves estimated disease-free survival (DFS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) for these subtypes in the SJTUBCDB, while subgroup analyses using multivariable models were performed based on menstruation, pN stage, HER2-targeted therapy, and endocrinotherapy. The ER+/PR+/HER2+ group showed significantly better DFS and BCSS than the ER+/PR-/HER2+ group, particularly in postmenopausal and pN0 stage patients. Survival outcomes were similar after anti-HER2 therapy or endocrine aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in both groups. However, among patients receiving selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) treatment, those in the ER+/PR-/HER2+ group had a significantly worse prognosis compared to ER+/PR+/HER2+ patients. HER2-positive breast cancers with different HR statuses exhibit distinct clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. Patients in the ER+/PR+/HER2+ group generally experience better survival, particularly in postmenopausal and pN0 stage patients. Treatment strategies should consider HR status and specific modalities for better personalized management.",['Ding W; Ye D; Chen H; Lin Y; Li Z; Tu C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38231460,"ER+/PR+/HER2+ and ER+/PR-/HER2+ subtypes have significant implications for prognosis.

"Impact of the 2022 New Mexico, US wildfires on air quality and health.","The 2022 wildfires in New Mexico, United States, were unparalleled compared to past wildfires in the state in both their scale and intensity, resulting in poor air quality and a catastrophic loss of habitat and livelihood. Among all wildfires in New Mexico in 2022, six wildfires were selected for our study based on the size of the burn area and their proximity to populated areas. These fires accounted for approximately 90 % of the total burn area in New Mexico in 2022. We used a regional chemical transport model and data-fusion technique to quantify the contribution of these six wildfires (April 6 to August 22) on particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>: diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, as well as the associated health impacts from short-term exposure. We estimated that these six wildfires emitted 152 thousand tons of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 287 thousand tons of volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere. We estimated that the average daily wildfire smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> across New Mexico was 0.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, though 1 h maximum exceeded 120 μg/m<sup>3</sup> near Santa Fe. Average wildfire smoke maximum daily average 8-h O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8-O<sub>3</sub>) contribution was 0.2 ppb during the study period over New Mexico. However, over the state 1 h maximum smoke O<sub>3</sub> exceeded 60 ppb in some locations near Santa Fe. Estimated all-cause excess mortality attributable to short term exposure to wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> and MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> from these six wildfires were 18 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI), 15-21) and 4 (95 % CI: 3-6) deaths. Additionally, we estimate that wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> was responsible for 171 (95 %: 124-217) excess cases of asthma emergency department visits. Our findings underscore the impact of wildfires on air quality and human health risks, which are anticipated to intensify with global warming, even as local anthropogenic emissions decline.",['Maji KJ; Ford B; Li Z; Hu Y; Hu L; Langer CE; Hawkinson C; Paladugu S; Moraga-McHaley S; Woods B; Vansickle M; Uejio CK; Maichak C; Sablan O; Magzamen S; Pierce JR; Russell AG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914336,"the 2022 wildfires in new Mexico, u.s., were unparalleled compared to past wildfires in the state in both their scale and intensity. these fires accounted for approximately 90 % of the total burn area in New Mexico in 2022."
Experience of the first adult-focussed undiagnosed disease program in Australia (AHA-UDP): solving rare and puzzling genetic disorders is ageless.,"Significant recent efforts have facilitated increased access to clinical genetics assessment and genomic sequencing for children with rare diseases in many centres, but there remains a service gap for adults. The Austin Health Adult Undiagnosed Disease Program (AHA-UDP) was designed to complement existing UDP programs that focus on paediatric rare diseases and address an area of unmet diagnostic need for adults with undiagnosed rare conditions in Victoria, Australia. It was conducted at a large Victorian hospital to demonstrate the benefits of bringing genomic techniques currently used predominantly in a research setting into hospital clinical practice, and identify the benefits of enrolling adults with undiagnosed rare diseases into a UDP program. The main objectives were to identify the causal mutation for a variety of diseases of individuals and families enrolled, and to discover novel disease genes. Unsolved patients in whom standard genomic diagnostic techniques such as targeted gene panel, exome-wide next generation sequencing, and/or chromosomal microarray, had already been performed were recruited. Genome sequencing and enhanced genomic analysis from the research setting were applied to aid novel gene discovery. In total, 16/50 (32%) families/cases were solved. One or more candidate variants of uncertain significance were detected in 18/50 (36%) families. No candidate variants were identified in 16/50 (32%) families. Two novel disease genes (TOP3B, PRKACB) and two novel genotype-phenotype correlations (NARS, and KMT2C genes) were identified. Three out of eight patients with suspected mosaic tuberous sclerosis complex had their diagnosis confirmed which provided reproductive options for two patients. The utility of confirming diagnoses for patients with mosaic conditions (using high read depth sequencing and ddPCR) was not specifically envisaged at the onset of the project, but the flexibility to offer recruitment and analyses on an as-needed basis proved to be a strength of the AHA-UDP. AHA-UDP demonstrates the utility of a UDP approach applying genome sequencing approaches in diagnosing adults with rare diseases who have had uninformative conventional genetic analysis, informing clinical management, recurrence risk, and recommendations for relatives.",['Wallis M; Bodek SD; Munro J; Rafehi H; Bennett MF; Ye Z; Schneider A; Gardiner F; Valente G; Murdoch E; Uebergang E; Hunter J; Stutterd C; Huq A; Salmon L; Scheffer I; Eratne D; Meyn S; Fong CY; John T; Mullen S; White SM; Brown NJ; McGillivray G; Chen J; Richmond C; Hughes A; Krzesinski E; Fennell A; Chambers B; Santoreneos R; Le Fevre A; Hildebrand MS; Bahlo M; Christodoulou J; Delatycki M; Berkovic SF'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39095811,the Austin Health adult undiagnosed disease program was designed to complement existing UDP programs that focus on paediatric rare diseases. it was conducted at a large Victorian hospital to demonstrate the benefits of bringing genomic techniques currently used predominantly in a research setting into hospital clinical practice.
Age at menarche and menstrual cycle pattern among school adolescent girls in Central India.,"The onset of menstruation is part of the maturation process. However, variability in menstrual cycle characteristics and menstrual disorders are common. The purpose of this study was to determine the age at menarche and patterns of menstruation among school adolescent girls and explore its variation across socio-economic and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out on 1100 school adolescent girls in district Wardha, Central India. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire on menstruation. Data was entered and analyzed by using Epi Info 6.04 software package. Chi- square value was used for testing statistical significance. Mean ages of menarche were 13.51 + 1.04 years and 13.67 + 0.8 years for urban and rural areas respectively. Abnormal cycle length was common and affected 30.48%. The majority 56.15 experienced dysmenorrhoea and 56.16 percent had premenstrual syndrome. Self medication was practiced by 7.13% of the adolescent girls. The most common premenstrual symptom was headache 26.74%. Absenteeism from the school 13.9% was the effect of menstruation related problems on their daily routine. Dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms were perceived as most distressing symptoms leading to school absenteeism. Majority of the girls 75.58% had discussed menstrual problems with someone, most commonly with their mothers 38.15%. There was a general lack of information about menstrual issues especially with regards to cycle length, duration of menses and age at menarche. Girls from families of high socio-economic class have significantly lower mean menarcheal age in both urban and rural area. The mean age of menarche was significantly higher in girls involved in vigorous sporting activity in urban area compared to their non-sporting counterparts. Age at menarche was delayed. The menstrual disorders among female adolescents are common. A school health education on menstrual problems targeting adolescent girls and their parents and routine screening for menstrual problems by healthcare providers can help to prevent the absenteeism in the school.",['Dambhare DG; Wagh SV; Dudhe JY'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22980118,"study was carried out on 1100 school adolescent girls in district Wardha, central India. study was carried out using a self-administered questionnaire on menstruation."
The association between the use of fertility indicators and fecundability in a Danish preconception cohort.,"The use of fertility indicators to predict ovulation has largely been studied for contraceptive purposes, while less so as fertility-promoting tools. To investigate the association between fertility indicators and fecundability in Danish women trying to conceive. Web-based preconception cohort study. We analysed data from 11,328 females aged 18-49 years trying to conceive without fertility treatment for ≤6 menstrual cycles, from the Danish SnartGravid.dk and SnartForældre.dk cohorts (2007-2023). Participants reported the use of fertility indicators (counting days since the last menstrual period, cervical fluid monitoring, urinary ovulation testing, feeling ovulation, using a smartphone fertility app and measuring basal body temperature [BBT]). Time to pregnancy was measured in menstrual cycles ascertained by self-reported pregnancy status. We estimated fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using proportional probabilities regression models adjusted for age, socio-economic position, health indicators, reproductive history and gynaecological factors. Fertility indicators were used by 63.3% of participants at study entry. Counting days was the most common (46.9%), while measuring BBT was the least (3.0%). Other indicators ranged from 17.0% to 23.6%, with 69.7% using more than one indicator. Compared with non-use, use of any fertility indicator was associated with greater fecundability (adjusted FR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08, 1.19). Cervical fluid monitoring showed the strongest association (aFR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03, 2.07), followed by urinary ovulation testing (aFR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16, 1.58) and counting days (aFR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09, 1.29). Feeling ovulation and fertility apps were modestly associated with fecundability, while measuring BBT was not associated. Sensitivity analysis restricting to ≤2 cycles of attempt time and two cycles of follow-up showed an aFR for any indicator use of 1.21 (95% CI 1.13, 1.31). In this Danish preconception cohort, use of fertility indicators was associated with a higher fecundability, varying by type of indicator.",['Pedersen ES; Mikkelsen EM; Sørensen HT; Hatch EE; Wise LA; Rothman KJ; Stanford JB; Laursen ASD'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39109606,use of fertility indicators to predict ovulation has largely been studied for contraceptive purposes. participants reported the use of fertility indicators. fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured in menstrual cycles.
Variations in strength-related measures during the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic women: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To systematically review the current body of research that has investigated changes in strength-related variables during different phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic women. Systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science using search terms related to the menstrual cycle and strength-related measures. Two reviewers reached consensus that 21 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Methodological rigour was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Random effects meta-analyses were used to compare the early-follicular, ovulatory and mid-luteal phases for maximal voluntary contraction, isokinetic peak torque, and explosive strength. The assessment of study quality showed that a high level of bias exists in specific areas of study design. Non-significant and small or trivial effect sizes (p≥0.26, Hedges g≤0.35) were identified for all strength-related variables in each comparison between phases. 95% confidence intervals for each comparison suggested the uncertainty associated with each estimate extends to a small effect on strength performance with unclear direction (-0.42≤g≤0.48). The heterogeneity for each comparison was also small (p≥0.83, I<sup>2</sup>=0%). Strength-related measures appear to be minimally altered (g≤0.35) by the fluctuations in ovarian sex hormones that occur during the menstrual cycle. This finding should be interpreted with caution due to the methodological shortcomings identified by the quality assessment.",['Blagrove RC; Bruinvels G; Pedlar CR'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456980,"systematic review and meta-analysis of strength-related measures. a literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science."
School nurses and menstrual communication: Destigmatizing the stigma among adolescents.,"The purpose of this study is to understand how school nurses, often the first line of defense for menstruating adolescents, use communication to assist adolescents in destigmatizing menstruation. I conducted semi-structured narrative interviews with nine nurses employed in a large school district in Northeast Indiana. Interviews were coded, categorized, and used a phronetic iterative approach. Analysis determines that nurses assist menstruating students using steps toward accepting menstruation and suggesting ways to avoid menstrual stigmatization. This study suggests that school nurses use positive language to assist students in handling their menstruation problems, develop allyships with parents and other teachers, and stress menstrual education. This study highlights the need for more funding for menstrual products and additional school nurses.",['LeBlanc SS'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38733209,school nurses use communication to assist adolescents in destigmatizing menstruation. study suggests that nurses use positive language to assist students in handling menstruation problems.
Gender Inequalities of Health and Quality of Life in Informal Caregivers in Spain: Protocol for the Longitudinal and Multicenter CUIDAR-SE Study.,"The aging population and increased disability prevalence in Spain have heightened the demand for long-term care. Informal caregiving, primarily performed by women, plays a crucial role in this scenario. This protocol outlines the CUIDAR-SE study, focusing on the gender-specific impact of informal caregiving on health and quality of life among caregivers in Andalusia and the Basque Country from 2013 to 2024. This study aims to analyze the gender differences in health and quality of life indicators of informal caregivers residing in 2 Spanish autonomous communities (Granada, Andalusia, and Gipuzkoa; Basque Country) and their evolution over time, in relation to the characteristics of caregivers, the caregiving situation, and support received. The CUIDAR-SE study uses a longitudinal, multicenter design across 3 phases, tracking health and quality of life indicators among informal caregivers. Using a questionnaire adapted to the Spanish context that uses validated scales and multilevel analysis, the research captures changes in caregivers' experiences amid societal crises, notably the 2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. A multistage randomized cluster sampling technique is used to minimize study design effects. Funding for the CUIDAR-SE study was in 3 phases starting in January 2013, 2017, and 2021, spanning a 10-year period. Data collection commenced in 2013 and continued annually, except for 2016 and 2020 due to financial and pandemic-related challenges. As of March 2024, a total of 1294 participants have been enrolled, with data collection ongoing for 2023. Initial data analysis focused on gender disparities in caregiver health, quality of life, burden, perceived needs, and received support, with results from phase I published. Currently, analysis is ongoing for phases II and III, as well as longitudinal analysis across all phases. This protocol aims to provide comprehensive insights into caregiving dynamics and caregivers' experiences over time, as well as understand the role of caregiving on gender inequality in health, considering regional variations. Despite limitations in participant recruitment, focusing on registered caregivers, the study offers a detailed exploration of the health impacts of caregiving in Spain. The incorporation of a gender perspective and the examination of diverse contextual factors enrich the study's depth, contributing significantly to the discourse on caregiving health complexities in Spain.

Centering Communities in Global Health: Using Human-Centered Design to Facilitate Collaboration and Intervention Development.,"Utilizing iterative and collaborative tools, Human-centered Design (HCD) facilitates the creation of tailored solutions for multifaceted issues by fostering empathy and a deep understanding of human behaviors. This paper presents insights gleaned from employing HCD tools to center communities in global health intervention development. The study team collaborated with community members in Dailekh, Nepal to co-design interventions to address harms associated with menstrual seclusion, known as <i>chhaupadi</i>. A Community Design Team, comprising 10 women representing various castes and ages convened for a four-day intervention co-design workshop in the community. A Community Validation Team, comprising 12 individuals from diverse occupational and caste backgrounds provided feedback on the interventions. Additionally, six village leaders participated in Key Informant Interviews to garner additional insights. In the study's initial ""discovery"" phase, the Community Design Team employed HCD tools to generate a nuanced understanding of the context, stakeholders, and community experiences. Subsequently, in the second ""design"" phase, the Community Design Team crafted interventions to address harms associated with <i>chhaupadi</i>. Invaluable lessons gained from this study underscore the necessity of crafting contextually suitable tools, checklists, and prompts for participants, allocating sufficient staff, time, and resources, and adapting to participants' literacy levels and engagement preferences, whether through group or individual activities. Reflecting on these insights, our experience suggests HCD offers promising tools to authentically and equitably involve participants with diverse backgrounds in articulating their own ideas for community-based solutions in Nepal. Health practitioners, researchers, and intervention development experts are encouraged to consider adopting HCD methodologies to prioritize community voices in devising solutions for complex health challenges.",['Baumann SE; Rabin MA; Devkota B; Hawk M; Upadhyaya K; Shrestha GR; Joseph B; Burke JG'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39044545,"a community design team in dailekh, Nepal co-designs interventions. the study crafted interventions to address harms associated with menstrual seclusion. the study aims to facilitate collaboration and intervention development."
Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual-related) epilepsy.,"This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019. Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre-ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non-hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non-hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non-hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs of blinded or open-label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster-randomised trials were excluded). We included cross-over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash-out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non-hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure-free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. Following title, abstract, and full-text screening, we included eight full-text articles reporting on four double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs. We included two cross-over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non-hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. Meta-analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure-free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. This review provides very low-certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate- to low-certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non-hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses.

Intraovarian Administration of Autologous Menstrual Blood Derived-Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Women with Premature Ovarian Failure.,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a well-known cause of infertility, particularly in women under the age of 40. POF is also associated with elevated gonadotropin levels, amenorrhea and sex-hormone deficiency. In this study, the therapeutic potential of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from menstrual blood (Men-MSCs) for patients with POF was evaluated. 15 POF patients were included in the study. The cultured Men-MSCs were confirmed by flow cytometry, karyotype, endotoxin and mycoplasma and were then injected into the patients' right ovary by vaginal ultrasound guidance and under general anesthesia and aseptic conditions. Changes in patients' anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteal hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) levels, as well as general flushing and vaginal dryness were followed up to one year after treatment. All patients were satisfied with a decrease in general flushing and vaginal dryness. 4 patients (2.9%) showed a spontaneous return of menstruation without additional pharmacological treatment. There was a significant difference in AFC (0 vs. 1 ± 0.92 count, p value ≤0.001%), FSH (74 ± 22.9 vs. 54.8 ± 17.5 mIU/mL, p-value ≤0.05%), E2 (10.2 ± 6 vs. 21.8 ± 11.5 pg/mL p-value ≤0.01%), LH (74 ± 22.9 vs. 54.8 ± 17.5 IU/L,p-value ≤0.01%) during 3 months post-injection. However, there were no significant changes in AMH (p-value ≥0.05%). There were also no significant differences in assessed parameters between 3 and 6 months after cell injection. According to the findings of this study, administration of Men-MSCs improved ovarian function and menstrual restoration in some POF patients.",['Zafardoust S; Kazemnejad S; Darzi M; Fathi-Kazerooni M; Saffarian Z; Khalili N; Edalatkhah H; Mirzadegan E; Khorasani S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36702667,premature ovarian failure is a well-known cause of infertility. the cause of infertility is particularly in women under the age of 40.
Dietary diversity among women with depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in Nepal.,"This study sought to determine whether there was any correlation between the dietary diversity score and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in Nepali women who were of reproductive age. In a national cross-sectional population-based survey of women (15-49 years) (N = 7442) in Nepal, MDD was assessed with the PHQ-9 and GAD with the GAD-7, and dietary diversity with a 24 h food consumption recall of 10 food groups. Multinominal and logistic regression were used to estimate predictors of MDD and GAD symptoms. The prevalence of mild and moderate-to-severe MDD symptoms was 15.7% and 5.4%, respectively, and the prevalence of mild and moderate-to-severe GAD symptoms was 20.8% and 7.5%, respectively. The overall dietary diversity mean score was 4.66 (SD = 1.67). In the final multivariable model, adjusted for relevant confounders, dietary diversity was inversely associated with moderate-to-severe MDD symptoms (Adjusted Incidence Risk Ratios-AIRR: 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97), and with moderate-to-severe GAD symptoms (AIRR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.92). Furthermore, in the fully adjusted regression model, pulses (Adjusted Odds Ratio-AOR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98) and Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables (AOR: 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.94) were inversely associated with MDD symptoms. In addition, Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables (AOR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.75), dairy (AOR: 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.97), and pulses (AOR: 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85) were inversely associated with GAD symptoms.

Status of Body Mass Index and Blood Pressure in Post-Menopausal Women.,"Menopause, in between the age of 45-55 years every woman faces it, that means completely stoppage of menstruation because the decrease level of estrogen from the normal level. In this period the quality life is disturbed due to hormonal imbalance specially estrogen. This study was done to evaluate the changes of body mass index and blood pressure in post-menopausal women in comparison to reproductive women. This cross-sectional analytical type of study was done in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh and the period is from January 2021 to December 2021. Total 140 women subjects age ranged between 25-65 years were involved in this study. Among them 70 post-menopausal women (45-65 years) were involved as study group (Group II) and 70 (seventy) reproductive women (25-45 years) were taken as control group (Group I). By anthropometric measurements, Body Mass Index (BMI) such as height and weight were taken in meter and kilogram respectively and systolic and diastolic blood pressure by aneroid sphygmomanometer (ALPK2, Japan). Findings were expressed as mean±SD and by unpaired student's 't' test, analytical significance of difference among the group was calculated. The mean±SD of BMI of Group I and Group II were 23.05±4.43kg/m² and 29.01±3.12kg/m² respectively. The mean±SD of body mass index is significantly higher in study group in comparison with control group. The average (±SD) of systolic blood pressure of control group I and study group II were 118.29±10.00 mm of Hg & 134.00±11.91 mm of Hg respectively. The mean±SD of systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in study group in comparison with control group. The mean±SD of diastolic blood pressure of control group I and study Group II were 79.21±6.46 mm of Hg and 89.00±6.23 mm of Hg respectively. The mean±SD of diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in study group in comparison with control group. Post-menopausal women with high systolic and diastolic pressure have a chance of development of cardiovascular diseases, stroke.

Long versus short course treatment with Metformin and Clomiphene Citrate for ovulation induction in women with PCOS.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive-aged women. Apart from infertility, women with PCOS often have other endocrine disorders, including insulin resistance,hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenism. Metformin,combined with clomiphene citrate (CC), has been shown to be more effective in ovulation induction when compared with clomiphene citrate alone. The optimal duration for metformin pretreatment before initiation of clomiphene citrate, however, is unknown. To determine the effectiveness of short-course (less than four weeks) metformin plus CC versus long-course (four weeks or more) metformin plus CC with regard to ovulation and achievement of pregnancy in infertile PCOS women. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (December 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, 2006 issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to 7 January 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to 7 January 2007). Randomised controlled trials comparing short-course (less than four weeks) metformin plus CC versus long-course (four weeks or more) metformin plus CC for ovulation or achievement of pregnancy in infertile PCOS women. No trials were found that met the selection criteria. No randomised controlled trials were identified. There are insufficient data to determine whether short-chouse metformin pretreatment is as effective as the conventional long-course metformin pretreatment before initiation of clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in infertile PCOS patients. A well-designed randomised controlled trial is needed to answer this important clinical question.",['Sinawat S; Buppasiri P; Lumbiganon P; Pattanittum P'],2008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18254096,polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive-aged women. women with PCOS often have other endocrine disorders.
Excessive proliferating cell nuclear antigen attenuates endometrial adhesive capacity and decidualization in patients with recurrent implantation failure.,"Does the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the endometrium regulate endometrial receptivity in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF)? A high abundance of PCNA attenuates endometrial adhesive capacity and decidualization in patients with RIF. Aberrant expression of PCNA has been discovered in multiple infertility-related disorders. However, the expression pattern and role of PCNA in the establishment of endometrial receptivity and endometrial decidualization in patients with RIF remain unclear. We analysed the expression of PCNA in mid-secretory endometrial tissues from 24 patients with RIF and 24 healthy women. Additionally, PCNA expression levels were measured in proliferative and mid-secretory phase endometrial tissue samples from women with regular menstrual cycles and in decidual tissue samples taken from ten women during normal early pregnancy (n = 10 per phase for each group). The function and regulatory mechanisms of PCNA in endometrial adhesive capacity and endometrial decidualization were investigated using BeWo spheroids, Ishikawa cells, and human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). The expression of PCNA in mid-secretory endometrial tissues of patients with RIF and women with normal endometrium and in endometrial tissue at different stages of the menstrual cycle and in decidualized tissues was analysed by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). Furthermore, the number of BeWo spheroids directly attached to the Ishikawa cell monolayers, and the potential molecular mechanisms involved, were compared between cells overexpressing PCNA and a control group. Additionally, the effect and regulatory mechanisms of PCNA on the decidualization of HESCs in vitro were investigated. Our findings indicated that the abundance of PCNA was dramatically greater in mid-secretory endometrial tissues from patients with RIF than in those from women with healthy endometrium. The expression of PCNA increased in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle but decreased gradually in the mid-secretory phase and in decidual tissues. Interestingly, PCNA was expressed in both human endometrial epithelial cells (HEECs) and HESCs. In Ishikawa cells, PCNA overexpression dramatically reduced the endometrial adhesive capacity by inhibiting the expression of adhesion molecules (E-cadherin and integrin β3) and activating the FAK/paxillin signalling pathway. Furthermore, in HESCs, PCNA overexpression attenuated endometrial decidualization by activating the AKT/β-catenin signalling pathway and increasing tight junctions between cells by upregulating ZO-1 and occludin expression. In addition, PCNA-ELAVL1 interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in decidualized HESCs. N/A. The functional analysis of PCNA was limited by the number of human endometrial tissues. A larger sample size is required to further explore the potential roles of PCNA during embryo implantation. Moreover, the present results should be taken with caution, as only a few of the embryos that were transferred in RIF patients population underwent preimplantation genetic testing for embryonic chromosome aneuploidies (PGT-A), despite embryo ploidy testing being significant in the diagnosis of unexplained RIF. High PCNA expression attenuates endometrial adhesive capacity and decidualization in patients with RIF. These findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the occurrence of implantation failure.

Progestin primed ovarian stimulation using corifollitropin alfa in PCOS women effectively prevents LH surge and reduces injection burden compared to GnRH antagonist protocol.,"Utilizing corifollitropin alfa in GnRH antagonist (GnRHant) protocol in conjunction with GnRH agonist trigger/freeze-all strategy (corifollitropin alfa/GnRHant protocol) was reported to have satisfactory outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although lessening in gonadotropin injections, GnRHant were still needed. In addition to using corifollitropin alfa, GnRHant was replaced with an oral progestin as in progestin primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) to further reduce the injection burden in this study. We try to investigate whether this regimen (corifollitropin alfa/PPOS protocol) could effectively reduce GnRHant injections and prevent premature LH surge in PCOS patients undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles. This is a retrospective cohort study recruiting 333 women with PCOS, with body weight between 50 and 70 kg, undergoing first IVF/ICSI cycle between August 2015 and July 2018. We used corifollitropin alfa/GnRHant protocol prior to Jan 2017 (n = 160), then changed to corifollitropin alfa/PPOS protocol (n = 173). All patients received corifollitropin alfa 100 μg on menstruation day 2/3 (S1). Additional rFSH was administered daily from S8. In corifollitropin alfa/GnRHant group, cetrorelix 0.25 mg/day was administered from S5 till the trigger day. In corifollitropin alfa/PPOS group, dydrogesterone 20 mg/day was given from S1 till the trigger day. GnRH agonist was used to trigger maturation of oocyte. All good quality day 5/6 embryos were frozen, and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) was performed on subsequent cycle. A comparison of clinical outcomes was made between the two protocols. The primary endpoint was the incidence of premature LH surge and none of the patients occurred. Dydrogesterone successfully replace GnRHant to block LH surge while an average of 6.8 days of GnRHant injections were needed in the corifollitropin alfa/GnRHant group. No patients suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The other clinical outcomes including additional duration/dose of daily gonadotropin administration, number of oocytes retrieved, and fertilization rate were similar between the two groups. The implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate in the first FET cycle were also similar between the two groups. In women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, corifollitropin alfa/PPOS protocol could minimize the injections burden with comparable outcomes to corifollitropin alfa/GnRHant protocol.",['Huang TC; Huang MZ; Seow KM; Yang IJ; Pan SP; Chen MJ; Hwang JL; Chen SU'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34815477,corifollitropin alfa was used in a cohort study in 333 women with PCOS. the regimen was used in conjunction with agonist trigger/freeze-all strategy.
Assessment of the Menstrual Problems among Teenage Girls: A Tertiary Care Center Study.,"Due to shame over discussing menstruation and fear of illness, many adolescent girls with monthly problems never visit their family doctor or gynecologist. The presentation can be delayed as a result. The current study's goal was to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of adolescent females experiencing menstruation issues and the nature of those problems, and how they were handled. The problems faced by the adolescent girls attending the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were analyzed retrospectively, and all their study characteristics and conditions were evaluated. The descriptive demographics are only represented in the current study. Two hundred-two teenage girls with menstruation issues visited our hospital overall. 64% of them were late adolescents, 96% lived in cities, 89 were unmarried, and 50% belonged to the middle class socioeconomically. Amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and irregular menstrual periods affected 86 (61%) people, 38 (27%) people, and 17 (12%) people, respectively. Patients were treated with appropriate counseling and medicinal and/or surgical care. Most of the teenage girls in our study had anemia. Therefore, it is essential to educate people on the importance of nutrition, different menstrual disorders, normal physiology, and the prevention and management of anemia. Adolescent-friendly health care has been attempted and partially developed in India's governmental and private systems. As a result, counseling and management of adolescent menstrual difficulties must be offered in the current health and medical care systems.",['Divya S; Thomas TM; Ajmeera R; Hegde A; Parikh T; Shivakumar S'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37654320,study aims to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of adolescent girls. the problems faced by the adolescent girls attending the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were analyzed retrospectively. the problems faced by the adolescent girls were analyzed retrospectively.
Role of the gut microbiota and innate immunity in polycystic ovary syndrome: Current updates and future prospects.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the modern intractable reproductive diseases. The female irregular menstruation, infertility, obesity, and so forth caused by PCOS have become a hot issue affecting family harmony and social development. The aetiology of PCOS is complex. In recent years, many scholars have found that its pathogenesis was related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Gut microbiota can form two-way communication with the brain through the 'gut-brain axis' and affect the host's metabolism. Current research has confirmed that the gut microbiota can interfere with glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, hormone secretion and follicular development in women by altering intestinal mucosal permeability and secreting metabolites. In addition, the diversity and composition of gut microbiota of PCOS patients changed, which may affect the metabolic function of the gut microbiota and the ability to produce metabolites, and may also directly or indirectly affect the endocrine function. This study reviewed recent research advances about the role of gut microbiota in PCOS. In order to provide basis for prevention and treatment of PCOS based on gut microbiota.",['Zhou M; Yu J; Li X; Ruan Z; Yu S'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38546608,"polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the modern intractable reproductive diseases. the female irregular menstruation, infertility, obesity, and so forth caused by PCOS have become a hot issue affecting family harmony and social development."
Relationship between menstruation-related experiences and health-related quality of life of Japanese high school students: a cross-sectional study.,"Recently, there has been a growing global movement concerning menstruation, a healthy and natural physiological phenomenon in women. The disadvantages caused by menstruation are ""gender-based obstacles."" Adolescent girls are also under its influence and perhaps in a more vulnerable situation than adult women. This study investigated the experiences related to menstruation that affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of high school students in Japan. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a municipal high school in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The study population comprised 233 female students among which 198 completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire contained items about menstruation and HRQOL measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Approximately a quarter had experienced difficulties in obtaining sanitary products in the past year, whether for economic or non-economic reasons. Menstruation-associated symptoms, impact on daily life, trouble with menstruation at an unexpected time, usage of painkillers, unhealthy lifestyle, and negative perception of menstruation were significantly associated with lower HRQOL scores, particularly in the mental component summary scores of the SF-36. For the high school students with severe menstruation-associated symptoms that interfere with their daily lives, the results of this study suggest that improving access to medical care, information, and education can contribute to a better HRQOL.",['Nakao M; Ishibashi Y; Hino Y; Yamauchi K; Kuwaki K'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37990218,"study found menstruation affects health-related quality of life of high school students in japan. study was conducted at a municipal high school in Fukuoka prefecture, japan. a quarter had experienced difficulties in obtaining sanitary products in the past year."
Assessment of Knowledge of Sexual Reproductive Health Among Female University Students in Jordan.,"Sexual reproductive health (SRH) is an important aspect of human life, especially in the younger age groups. Young adults are the most vulnerable group to SRH consequences, as they have limited access to its information and services. This is one of the earliest studies conducted to examine the knowledge of SRH among female university students in Jordan. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of SRH among female Jordanian university students and to determine the social and individual factors that may affect this knowledge. A cross-sectional design was used, and a convenient sample consisting of 427 female university students was recruited from the University of Jordan. The inclusion criteria were female unmarried students aged 18-25 years old, while the exclusion criteria were married, divorced, or engaged female students. A valid and reliable self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the student's knowledge of SRH. Data were collected between February 21 and March 20, 2022. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) was used for data analysis, and an independent sample t-test was used to investigate mean differences in the SRH score based on demographic characteristics. Overall, it was found that only 26.2% of all the participants had adequate knowledge of SRH. Additionally, they have inadequate knowledge regarding the different aspects of SRH such as premarital, vaccination, menstruation, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), except for the section on folic acid, which demonstrated adequate knowledge. Furthermore, the participants' scores of total SRH knowledge were significantly different based on their original place of living, current residency, educational level, religion, and university faculty. Due to the inadequate level of knowledge, this study highlights the need to establish educational and awareness programs concerning SRH and to incorporate this subject into the university and school curricula.",['Alkhalili M; Al-Hmaid Y; Kheirallah K; Mehaisen L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38435157,study was conducted to assess knowledge of SRH among female students in the country. the study was carried out by a cross-sectional design.
The genomics of the human endometrium.,"The endometrium is a complex tissue that lines the inside of the endometrial cavity. The gene expression of the different endometrial cell types is regulated by ovarian steroids and paracrine-secreted molecules from neighbouring cells. Due to this regulation, the endometrium goes through cyclic modifications which can be divided simply into the proliferative phase, the secretory phase and the menstrual phase. Successful embryo implantation depends on three factors: embryo quality, the endometrium's state of receptivity, and a synchronised dialogue between the maternal tissue and the blastocyst. There is a need to characterise the endometrium's state of receptivity in order to prevent reproductive failure. No single molecular or histological marker for this status has yet been found. Here, we review the global transcriptomic analyses performed in the last decade on a normal human endometrium. These studies provide us with a clue about what global gene expression can be expected for a non-pathological endometrium. These studies have shown endometrial phase-specific transcriptomic profiles and common temporal gene expression patterns. We summarise the biological processes and genes regulated in the different phases of natural cycles and present other works on different conditions as well as a receptivity diagnostic tool based on a specific gene set profile. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Molecular Genetics of Human Reproductive Failure.",['Ruiz-Alonso M; Blesa D; Simón C'],2012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22634130,"the endometrium is a complex tissue that lines the inside of the endometrial cavity. the gene expression of the different endometrial cell types is regulated by ovarian steroids and paracrine-secreted molecules from neighbouring cells. successful embryo implantation depends on three factors: embryo quality, the endometrium's state of receptivity, and a synchronised dialogue between the maternal tissue and the blastocyst."
A pharmacist's role in increasing access to menstrual products: an education and advocacy approach.,"Individuals who menstruate grapple with diverse challenges in menstrual and reproductive health. This includes financial burdens, societal stigmas, and negative mental and physical health implications. Period poverty, marked by insufficient access to menstrual products, education, and sanitation, remains a prevalent and poorly addressed issue. Alarming statistics highlight the extent of this problem and shed light on the staggering number of individuals lacking access to essential menstrual products. The discourse extends to the safety and accessibility of a diverse array of menstrual products. A comprehensive comparison of the cost of available period products was conducted using data obtained from various retail websites. The often-overlooked potential indirect expenses and profound impacts on quality of life were also discussed. Amidst other public health initiatives, pharmacists have emerged as pivotal advocates and educators. Pharmacists are poised to drive initiatives that increase access to menstrual products through public health education and advocacy. By providing education on different menstrual product options, pharmacists can empower individuals to make informed decisions based on their needs. This perspective illuminates the complex impacts of menstruation on individuals and proposes that pharmacists can play a role in overcoming barriers to access. The proposed strategies, rooted in education, research, and advocacy, pave the way for enhancing access, reducing stigma, and elevating the quality of life for those navigating the intricate complexities of menstruation.",['Potter K; Beal-Stahl J'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38827820,pharmacists are poised to drive initiatives that increase access to menstrual products through public health education and advocacy. they are poised to drive initiatives that increase access to menstrual products through public health education and advocacy.
"""We only trust each other"": A qualitative study exploring the overdose risk environment among persons who inject drugs living with HIV in Nairobi, Kenya.","In Kenya, overdose remains a major public health concern with approximately 40% of persons who inject drugs (PWID) reporting personal overdoses. PWID living with HIV (PWID-LH) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing fatal and non-fatal overdoses because of the surrounding physical, social, economic, and political environments, which are not fully understood in Kenya. Through qualitative inquiry, this study characterizes Kenya's overdose risk environment. Participants were purposively recruited from a larger cohort study from September to December 2018 using the following inclusion criteria: HIV-positive, age ≥18 years, injected drugs in the last year, and completed cohort study visits. Semi-structured interviews explored experiences of personal and observed overdoses, including injection settings, sequence of events (e.g., pre-, during, and post-overdose), safety strategies, and treatment. Interviews were transcribed, translated (Swahili to English), reviewed, and analyzed thematically, applying a risk environment framework. Nearly all participants described personal and/or observed overdose experiences (96%) and heroin was the most frequently reported substance (79%). Overdose precursors included increased consumption, polysubstance use, recent incarceration, and rushed injections. There were also indications of female-specific precursors, including violence and accessing prefilled syringes within occupational settings. Overdose safety strategies included avoiding injecting alone, injecting drugs incrementally, assessing drug quality, and avoiding polysubstance use. Basic first-aid techniques and naloxone use were common treatment strategies; however, naloxone awareness was low (25%). Barriers to treatment included social network abandonment, police discrimination, medical stigma, fatalism/religiosity, medical and transportation costs, and limited access to treatment services. In Kenya, the overdose risk environment highlights the need for comprehensive overdose strategies that address the physical, social, economic, and political environments. Morbidity and mortality from overdose among PWID-LH could be reduced through overdose prevention initiatives that support harm reduction education, naloxone awareness, and access, destigmatization of PWID, and reforming punitive policies that criminalize PWID-LH.",['Maurano M; Bukusi D; Masyuko S; Bosire R; Gitau E; Guthrie BL; Monroe-Wise A; Musyoki H; Owuor MA; Sambai B; Sinkele W; Kingston H; Farquhar C; Mbogo L; Ludwig-Barron NT'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38954694,"in Kenya, overdose remains a major public health concern. approximately 40% of people who inject drugs report personal overdoses. overdose safety strategies included avoiding injecting alone, injecting drugs."
Sleep characteristics in underweight young females across their menstrual cycles: A sleep-monitoring survey study with preliminary results.,"This study investigated the association between underweight and sleep in young females across their menstrual cycles. A lifestyle-monitoring survey was conducted among 38 female university students aged 18-24 years in Japan from January to December 2023. Sleep data from 28 participants were analysed. Participants were categorized into underweight (n = 10) and control (n = 18) groups based on a baseline body mass index cut-off of 18.5 kg m<sup>-2</sup>. Sleep parameters were assessed using a daily sleep questionnaire, sleep sensor mats, and urinary melatonin metabolites across their menstrual cycles. The results indicated no significant differences in sleep patterns between the underweight and control groups or menstrual cycle phases, as assessed using both the daily sleep questionnaire and the sleep sensor mats. However, underweight participants experienced more difficulty maintaining sleep during the follicular phase. Body mass index significantly correlated with sleep efficiency (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.52) and wake after sleep onset (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.56). While urinary melatonin metabolite levels did not differ significantly between the groups or menstrual cycle phases, decreased levels during the luteal phase were more prevalent in the underweight group (7 of 10 participants) than in the control group (3 of 13 participants). This study suggests an association between underweight and sleep quality, especially nocturnal awakening, in young females. These findings underscore the importance of considering sleep quality in the management of underweight young females to improve their overall health outcomes.",['Kayaba M; Yajima K; Nogami M; Nose-Ogura S; Ogata H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38797940,study investigated the association between underweight and sleep in young females across their menstrual cycles. study was conducted among 38 female university students aged 18-24 years in japan from January to December 2023. participants were categorized into underweight (n = 10) and control (n = 18) groups based on a baseline body mass index cut-off of 18.5 kg msup>-2/sup>.
"Age at menarche, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease complications in US women aged under 65 years: NHANES 1999-2018.","Diabetes and diabetes complications are on the rise in US adults aged <65 years, while onset of menarche at a younger age is also increasing. We examined the associations of age at menarche with type 2 diabetes among women aged <65 years and with cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications among women with diabetes. Using the nationally representative cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018, women aged 20-65 years free of cancer were included in the current analysis. Diabetes was defined as a self-reported diabetes diagnosis. CVD was defined as coronary heart disease or stroke. Age at menarche was self-reported age of first menstruation and categorised into ≤10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and ≥15 years. Of 17 377 women included in the analysis, 1773 (10.2%) reported having type 2 diabetes. Earlier age at menarche was associated with type 2 diabetes compared with median age at menarche of 13 years, after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, menopause status and family history of diabetes, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol consumption and body mass index (p for trend=0.02). Among women with diabetes, earlier age at menarche was associated with stroke with similar adjustment (p for trend=0.03), but not with total CVD. Extremely early age at menarche (≤10 years) was significantly associated with stroke (adjusted OR 2.66 (95% CI 1.07 to 6.64)) among women aged <65 years with diabetes with similar adjustment.

Use of continuous glucose monitoring trend arrows in the younger population with type 1 diabetes.,"Early control of glycaemia is key to reduce vascular complications in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Therefore, encouraging children and adolescents with T1DM to take responsibility for controlling glucose levels is an important yet a challenging task. The rapid expansion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems has allowed for more comprehensive analysis of glycaemia in T1D. Moreover, CGM devices have the ability to calculate rate of change in glucose levels and display the information as trend arrows. In turn, this can help to take evasive actions to return glucose levels to near physiological glycaemia, which can be highly motivating for young people with T1DM. In the absence of standardised, evidence-based guidance, this consensus document, generated by experts from the Arab Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes and international advisors, summarises recent literature on the use of trend arrows in young people with T1DM. The use of trend arrows in different CGM systems is reviewed and their clinical significance is highlighted. Adjusting insulin doses according to trend arrows is discussed while also addressing special situations, such as exercise, fasting, nocturnal hypoglycaemia and menstruation. Adequate understanding of trend arrows should facilitate optimisation of glycaemic control in the T1D population.",['Elbarbary N; Moser O; Al Yaarubi S; Alsaffar H; Al Shaikh A; Ajjan RA; Deeb A'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898300,rapid expansion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems has allowed for more comprehensive analysis of glycaemia in T1D. this can help to take evasive actions to return glucose levels to near physiological glycaemia.
Seasonal food intake and energy balance: Neuronal and non-neuronal control mechanisms.,"Animals inhabiting temperate and high latitudes undergo drastic seasonal changes in energy storage, facilitated by changes in food intake and body mass. Those seasonal changes in the animal's biology are not mere consequences of environmental energy availability but are anticipatory responses to the energetic requirements of the upcoming season and are actively timed by tracking the annual progression in photoperiod. In this review, we discuss how photoperiod is used to control energy balance seasonally and how this is distinct from energy homeostasis. Most notably, we suggest that photoperiodic control of food intake and body mass does not originate from the arcuate nucleus, as for homeostatic appetite control, but is rather to be found in hypothalamic tanycytes. Tanycytes are specialized ependymal cells lining the third ventricle, which can sense metabolites from the cerebrospinal fluid (e.g. glucose) and can control access of circulating signals to the brain. They are also essential in conveying time-of-year information by integrating photoperiod and altering hypothalamic thyroid metabolism, a feature that is conserved in seasonal vertebrates and connects to seasonal breeding and metabolism. We also discuss how homeostatic feedback signals are handled during times of rapid energetic transitions. Studies on leptin in seasonal mammals suggest a seasonal shift in central sensitivity and blood-brain transport, which might be facilitated by tanycytes. This article is part of the Special Issue on ""Food intake and feeding states"".",['Appenroth D; Cázarez-Márquez F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914372,tanycytes are specialized cells lining the third ventricle. they can sense metabolites from the cerebrospinal fluid (e.g. glucose) and control brain signals. tanycytes are essential in conveying time-of-year information.
"Male Body Odor Affects Emotional State, LH, and Cortisol Secretion in Women of Different Age Groups.","Hormone changes across women's menstrual cycles may lead to changes in their perceptions of chemical signals and their hormonal responses to these cues. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of menstrual cycle phase in the response to extracts of male axillary secretions (EMAS) in women. We tested healthy reproductive age and premenopausal women (<i>n</i> = 29). An EMAS/control solution was applied once every two hours during either the follicular or luteal phase, at which point saliva samples for luteinizing hormone (LH) and cortisol monitoring were collected. LH and cortisol concentrations were analyzed using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technique. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) scores were used to assess the participants' moods. For the first time, we showed that EMAS may produce opposite effects on LH secretion depending on the menstrual cycle phase of the recipient. We observed a significant increase in the number of LH peaks (<i>p</i> = 0.0447) and their amplitudes (<i>p</i> = 0.0469) when EMAS was applied during the follicular phase, while the same application in the luteal phase lowered the amplitudes of LH peaks (<i>p</i> = 0.0382). For the first time, we showed that EMAS application increased salivary cortisol levels in reproductive age women relative to premenopausal women (<i>p</i> = 0.0032). PANAS scores revealed changes in positive and negative affect after EMAS application. Our data indicate the significance of the menstrual cycle phase for EMAS' effects on LH secretion and mood, but not on cortisol secretion in women.",['Laktionova T; Kvasha I; Voznessenskaya V'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39061461,"male body Odor Affects Emotional State, LH, and cortisol secretion. the study was to determine the role of menstrual cycle phase in the response to extracts of male axillary secretions (EMAS) in women."
The drospirenone only pill as a contraceptive option for breastfeeding women: First data on users' acceptability and newborn development.,"Progestin-only pills (POPs) have been used for contraception in breastfeeding women for years. The existing guidelines allow the use of these contraceptives. Multicenter study with a single visit and retrospective data review. The study involved 100 women who used a drospirenone-only pill (DRSP) for contraception for at least 5 months during breastfeeding. The study aimed to analyze for those successful users the impact on new-born development, the bleeding profile and evaluate user satisfaction. Analysis of the newborns showed that their growth parameters length and weight, were within the expected range of standard development. The mean birth weight was 3368 g, with the lowest recorded weight being 2860 g and the highest 5040 g. The median length of the newborns was 55 cm, ranging from 35 to 65 cm. All new-borns demonstrated appropriate growth within the established percentiles. Acceptability with the bleeding profile was rated with a VAS score: the mean acceptability rating was 82.8. Women aged 35 years or older reported significantly higher acceptability compared to younger women (≥35 years: mean = 88.4, SD = 16.5; <35 years: mean = 80.3, SD = 20.2) (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Sixty-one patients (<i>N</i> = 61; 61.0%; 95% CI: 50.7 - 70.4%) expressed willingness to continue using DRSP after breastfeeding. Among those patients who continued the use of the DRSP only-pill for 5 months, this study shows no negative impact for new-borns, with no clinical influence observed on their growth. Additionally, those users expressed high satisfaction with the bleeding profile of the pill.Clinical trial registration number: DRKS00028438 .",['Regidor PA; Colli E; Jakimiuk A'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069793,"100 women used a drospirenone-only pill for contraception for at least 5 months during breastfeeding. the study involved 100 women who used a DRSP for contraception for at least 5 months during breastfeeding. the mean birth weight was 3368 g, with the lowest recorded weight being 2860 g and the highest 5040 g."
Clinical Coxiella burnetii infection in sable and roan antelope in South Africa.,"Various zoonotic microorganisms cause reproductive problems such as abortions and stillbirths, leading to economic losses on farms, particularly within livestock. In South Africa, bovine brucellosis is endemic in cattle, and from 2013-2018, outbreaks of Brucella melitensis occurred in sable. Coxiella burnetii, the agent responsible for the zoonotic disease known as Q-fever and/or coxiellosis, also causes reproductive problems and infects multiple domestic animal species worldwide, including humans. However, little is known of this disease in wildlife. With the expansion of the wildlife industry in South Africa, diseases like brucellosis and coxiellosis can significantly impact herd breeding success because of challenges in identifying, managing and treating diseases in wildlife populations. This study investigated samples obtained from aborted sable and roan antelope, initially suspected to be brucellosis, from game farms in South Africa using serology tests and ruminant VetMAX™ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) abortion kit. The presence of C. burnetii was confirmed with PCR in a sable abortion case, while samples from both sable and roan were seropositive for C. burnetii indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). This study represents the initial report of C. burnetii infection in sable and roan antelope in South Africa. Epidemiological investigations are crucial to assess the risk of C. burnetii in sable and roan populations, as well as wildlife and livestock in general, across South Africa. This is important in intensive farming practices, particularly as Q-fever, being a zoonotic disease, poses a particular threat to the health of veterinarians and farm workers as well as domestic animals.Contribution: A report of clinical C. burnetii infection in the wildlife industry contributes towards the limited knowledge of this zoonotic disease in South Africa.","[""Wiedeman W; Glover AB; Steyl J; O'Dell J; Van Heerden H""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39099298,"zoonotic microorganisms cause reproductive problems such as abortions and stillbirths. in south africa, bovine brucellosis is endemic in cattle. brucellosis is endemic in cattle, and from 2013-2018, outbreaks occurred in sable."
Surgical Timing and the Menstrual Cycle Affect Wound Healing in Young Breast Reduction Patients.,"Young female subjects are known to have the highest baseline menstrual hormone levels of any female age group. Studies have found an association between hormone levels and wound healing. This has been researched in the orthopedic, gynecologic, and dermatologic literature, and more recently, in young patients undergoing augmentation mammaplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the timing of surgery relative to the menstrual cycle plays a role in surgical complications following bilateral reduction mammaplasty. All female patients aged 25 years or younger with a documented last menstrual cycle undergoing a bilateral reduction mammaplasty from 2005 to 2013 were reviewed. Surgical timing and postoperative complications relative to the last menstrual cycle were recorded. The preovulatory phase referred to days 1 to 14 after the patient's last menstrual cycle, whereas the postovulatory phase referred to days 15 to 28. Forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty during the postovulatory phase was associated with development of wound dehiscence and hypertrophic scarring (p < 0.005), which were the most common postoperative complications. Surgery in the preovulatory or postovulatory phase did not affect hematoma, seroma, wound infection, or nipple-areolar complex necrosis rates (p > 0.05). Age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, large resection mass, and medical comorbidities did not affect wound dehiscence or scar hypertrophy rates (p > 0.05). Young patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty during the postovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle have an increased risk of wound healing issues and poor scarring. This may be attributable to hormonal fluxes occurring during this phase and the already high hormone levels in this population.",['Lopez MM; Castillo AC; Kaltwasser K; Phillips LG; Moliver CL'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26818273,women aged 25 years or younger have the highest baseline menstrual hormone levels of any female age group. study found an association between hormone levels and wound healing.
An analysis of oral contraceptive related videos on TikTok.,"TikTok has increasingly become a source of information about reproductive health. Patients seeking health information about oral contraception on TikTok may be influenced by videos containing misinformation or biased information. This social media infodemiological study aims to provide a descriptive content analysis of the quality and reliability of oral contraceptive health information on TikTok. Researchers screened 1,000 TikTok videos from December 2022 to March 2023 retrieved under various search terms related to oral contraceptives. Data, including engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, saves, and shares, were recorded. Video content including contraceptive methods discussed, efficacy, tolerability, and side effects were recorded. Two reviewers independently used a modified DISCERN criteria and Global Quality Scale (GQS) to assess the quality and reliability of information for each video. Five hundred seventy-four videos were analyzed after applying exclusion criteria. Videos had a median length of 27 seconds (Q1=13sec, Q3=57sec) and received a median of 35,000 total views (Q1=4856 views, Q3=411,400 views) and 166 views per day (Q1=28 views per day, Q3=2021 views per day). Video creators were 83.3% female and 58.7% white. The mean modified DISCERN score was 1.63 (SD=1.06) and the mean GQS score was 2.28 (SD=1.37). Video creators were 83.3% female and 58.7% white. The mean modified DISCERN score was 1.63 (SD=1.06) and the mean GQS score was 2.28 (SD=1.37). The most common topic discussed in the videos was the effects of contraception. Healthcare professionals had significantly higher DISCERN and GQS scores (<i>p</i><.001) than non-healthcare professionals. However, they received fewer views, likes, and comments on their videos (<i>p</i><.001). Healthcare professionals were 86 times more likely than non-healthcare professionals to post educational videos (<i>p</i><.001). However, non-educational content received significantly more views, likes, and comments than educational content (<i>p</i><.001). TikTok videos related to oral contraceptive health had low quality and reliability of information. The majority of videos were made by non-healthcare providers, and the most common topic discussed was the effects of contraception.

Treatment with assisted reproduction technologies in women with acute hepatic porphyria.,"Acute porphyrias are rare disorders of the heme biosynthetic pathway and present with acute neurovisceral symptoms that can be induced by hormonal changes and medications. Women are far more likely to present with clinical symptoms than men, particularly during parts of their lifetime with changes in the level of female sex hormones such as ovulation, menstruation, and pregnancy. Treatment of ovulatory dysfunction and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation require the administration of hormones, which are considered porphyrinogenic. Women with acute hepatic porphyria have therefore been considered unsuitable for such treatments in the past. We report on nine women with acute hepatic porphyria who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF), preceded by ovarian stimulation. Their mean age at the start of IVF was 33.2 years (range 27-38 years). Two women had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, two were treated for hyperprolactinemia, two had hypothyroidism, of which one also had type 1 diabetes, one had a uterus malformation, one had anovulatory cycles, and one used a sperm donor. All patients were able to undergo fertility treatment without experiencing severe porphyria attacks. Women with acute hepatic porphyria considering fertility treatments should be assessed individually for potential risks, treatment should be planned in close collaboration with a porphyria specialist, and biochemical activity should be monitored regularly during ovarian stimulation. As we gather more knowledge, we hope that the porphyrinogenicity of the stimulation agents is re-assessed and that more studies will shed light on the reproductive health of women living with acute hepatic porphyria.",['Vassiliou D; Lindén Hirschberg A; Sardh E'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34060066,"women with acute hepatic porphyria are more likely to present with clinical symptoms than men. women are more likely to present with clinical symptoms than men. treatment of ovulatory dysfunction and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation requires the administration of hormones, which are considered porphyrinogenic."
"Menstrual health and hygiene amongst adolescent girls and women of reproductive age: a study of practices and predictors, Odisha, India.","Menstruation is a major physiological change in a woman's life, but lack of knowledge, poor practices, socio-cultural barriers, poor access to products and their improper disposal have significant consequences on health, dignity and well-being of women and adolescent girls. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.",['Panda N; Desaraju S; Panigrahy RP; Ghosh U; Saxena S; Singh P; Panda B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38408979,study aimed to assess knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age. study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation.
[Prevalence of menorrhagia among women in Reunion Island].,"To estimate the prevalence of menorrhagia in women in Reunion Island using the Higham score, to evaluate self-reporting as an alternative diagnostic method, and to study women's level of knowledge about menorrhagia and its impact on their quality of life. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional observational study involving 185 adult women with menstrual periods living in Reunion Island. Women volunteered to answer an online self-questionnaire proposed by healthcare professionals from January to May 2023 in Reunion Island. They completed a general information questionnaire, the Higham score, a menorrhagia knowledge questionnaire and a menstrual quality of life questionnaire. The prevalence of menorrhagia in the sample was 48.1% using the Higham score and 46.5% using self-report. Women's level of knowledge about menorrhagia is still insufficient, given the significant impact on quality of life during menstruation among those suffering from this symptom. The prevalence of menorrhagia in our sample of women on Reunion Island is high. Measures need to be taken to break the taboos surrounding menstruation, promote menstrual education and foster a better understanding by women of menstrual pathologies, particularly menorrhagia. Early detection of this symptom would enable faster treatment and avoid complications and adverse effects on quality of life.",['Battegay M; Khaled S; Reitz L; Balaya V; Von Theobald P; Boukerrou M; Tran PL'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38342237,"women volunteered to answer an online self-questionnaire in Reunion Island. they completed a general information questionnaire, the Higham score and a menorrhagia knowledge questionnaire. prevalence of menorrhagia in the sample was 48.1% using the Higham score."
Menstrual abnormalities effects on clinical features and in vitro fertilization pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"The diagnostic criteria and phenotypes in polycystic ovary syndrome are heterogeneous. Currently, it is unclear how to assess a patient's prognosis based on the onset time of menstruation disturbance. Evidence on this topic is scarce and has mainly focused on menstrual patterns. This study aimed to assess the association between the onset time of menstrual disturbance and clinical features and in vitro fertilization pregnancy outcomes in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Our study was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted to compare live birth rates between fresh embryo transfer and frozen embryo transfer in 1508 individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome. Here, 1500 participants were classified into 2 groups according to the onset time of menstrual disturbance: immediately after menarche (early group) and after at least 1 year of regular menstruation (late group). We compared the prepregnancy clinical features, variables of ovarian stimulation, pregnancy outcomes after the initial cycle of embryo transfer, and perinatal and neonatal complications in the 2 groups. Compared with the late group, the early group had more antral follicles (32.00 [range, 27.25-39.50] vs 28.00 [range, 24.00-36.00]; <i>P</i><.001), an elevated level of antimüllerian hormone (7.02 ng/mL [range, 3.60-11.47] vs 5.66 ng/mL [range, 3.65-8.92]; <i>P</i>=.024), a higher level of baseline luteinizing hormone (10.01±5.93 vs 8.51±5.53 IU/l; <i>P</i><.001) and luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio (1.51 [range, 1.00-2.32] vs 1.45 [range, 0.92-2.13]; <i>P</i><.001), lower levels of fasting glucose (5.47 mmol/L [range, 5.11-5.73] vs 5.50 mmol/L [range, 5.17-5.76]; <i>P</i><.001), and insulin at 2 hours after 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (56.85 µU/mL [range, 34.63-94.54] vs 59.82 µU/mL [range, 33.56-94.67]; <i>P</i>=.027), a higher level of high-density lipoprotein (1.26 mmol/L [range, 1.04-1.37] vs 1.21 mmol/L [range, 1.07-1.45]; <i>P</i>=.006). During in vitro fertilization, the early group had a higher level of peak estradiol (4596.50 pg/mL [range, 2639.25-6321.00] vs 3954.00 pg/mL [range, 2378.75-6113.50]; <i>P</i>=.013), and luteinizing hormone (2.52 IU/L [range, 1.40-4.21] vs 1.93 IU/L [range, 0.91-3.32]; <i>P</i>=.010) on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin trigger. There was no statistically significant difference observed in the number of oocytes and embryos, the rates of pregnancy and live birth, and the risks of obstetrical and neonatal between the 2 groups. An early onset of menstrual disturbance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome may be associated with slightly more severe reproductive features and slightly milder metabolic features. Nonetheless, the outcomes of in vitro fertilization and the initial cycle of embryo transfer were comparable between the 2 groups.",['Miao H; Yang H; Yin M; Wang Y; Fang Y; Yang M; Zou J; Zhang W; Zhang L; Liu C; Wang Y; Wang Z; Yu Y; Wei D'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38584798,the diagnostic criteria and phenotypes in polycystic ovary syndrome are heterogeneous. it is unclear how to assess a patient's prognosis based on the onset time of menstruation disturbance. evidence on this topic is scarce and has mostly focused on menstrual patterns.
Effects of Muscular Fatigue on Position Sense in Two Phases of the Menstrual Cycle.,"It is generally accepted that local muscular fatigue can negatively affect position sense. Interestingly, it has been proposed that in women, position sense and neuromuscular coordination may be affected by fluctuations of estrogen and progesterone levels. The aim of this study was to examine the possible effect of localized muscle fatigue on knee joint position sense at two phases of the menses: follicular and luteal. Twenty physically active females aged 19-30 years, with normal menses, volunteered for this study. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to evaluate proprioception and perform the fatigue protocol of the knee extensors and flexors. Knee proprioception at rest and after fatigue at three knee target angles (30°, 45°, 60°) was measured. A three-way ANOVA analysis with repeated measures was performed. The results showed that the main effect of fatigue was significant, but no main effect of the menstrual cycle phase was found. Additionally, a main effect was found for the target angle (more flexed target knee joint angles were associated with larger angular error deviations). In conclusion, localized muscle fatigue can significantly reduce the accuracy of active knee joint repositioning in both the luteal and the follicular menstrual phases in young, physically active healthy women.",['Roditi EE; Tsatalas T; Sakkas GK; Koutedakis Y; Giakas G; Karatzaferi C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39051276,localized muscle fatigue can negatively affect position sense in two phases of the menses. it is generally accepted that local muscular fatigue can negatively affect position sense.
"The Prevalence, Management and Impact of Dysmenorrhea on Medical Students' Lives-A Multicenter Study.","Dysmenorrhea is defined as the presence of painful menstruation, and it affects daily activities in different ways. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and management of dysmenorrhea and to determine the impact of dysmenorrhea on the quality of life of medical students. The study conducted was prospective, analytical and observational and was performed between 7 November 2019 and 30 January 2020 in five university centers from Romania. The data was collected using an original questionnaire regarding menstrual cycles and dysmenorrhea. The information about relationships with family or friends, couples' relationships and university activity helped to assess the effects of dysmenorrhea on quality of life. The level of significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. The study comprised 1720 students in total. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 78.4%. During their menstrual period, most female students felt more agitated or nervous (72.7%), more tired (66.9%), as if they had less energy for daily activities (75.9%) and highly stressed (57.9%), with a normal diet being difficult to achieve (30.0%). University courses (49.4%), social life (34.5%), couples' relationships (29.6%), as well as relationships with family (21.4%) and friends (15.4%) were also affected, depending on the duration and intensity of the pain. Dysmenorrhea has a high prevalence among medical students and could affect the quality of life of students in several ways. During their menstrual period, most female students feel as if they have less energy for daily activities and exhibit a higher level of stress. The intensity of the symptoms varies considerably and, with it, the degree of discomfort it creates. Most student use both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to reduce pain (75.7%).

Genitourinary symptoms in patients with adenomyosis.,"Adenomyosis causes problems in women, including dysmenorrhea and abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding; however, its etiology is unknown. We hypothesized that urinary symptoms are frequent in patients with adenomyosis and that they affect the patients' quality of life. We conducted a pilot study from September 2011 to December 2011. Ninety-one patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis comprised the study group (adenomyosis group). Ninety-four women with a normal-appearing uterine myometrium on ultrasound comprised the control group. Patients filled out two validated questionnaires, the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7). Patients also underwent a pelvic examination and urinary symptoms were recorded. Groups were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test. The frequency of urinary symptoms was significantly higher in the adenomyosis group than in the control group (P = 0.0001), including stress urinary incontinence, urgency, daytime frequency, urge urinary incontinence, and dyspareunia. Total UDI scores were significantly higher in the adenomyosis group than those in the control group (P < 0.0001), as were IIQ scores of questions regarding social relations (P < 0.05).

Oral Administration of Artemisia argyi Polysaccharide Increases Estrogen Level and Maintains Blood Lipid Homeostasis in Ovariectomized Rats.,"Artemisia argyi polysaccharide (AAP) has a beneficial effect on menstruation-related symptoms and the potential regulation of lipid metabolism. It is expected to be a safe and effective ingredient for estrogen deficiency and lipid metabolic disorders. Here, we investigate the effect of AAP on body weight gain, estrogen level, and blood lipid changes in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Thirty-six female Wistar rats were randomly divided into six treatment groups, including a sham-operated (Sham) group, OVX group, estrogen replacement (OVX + E2) group, and AAP treatment (OVX + 125, 250, 500 mg/kg AAP) group. The body weight and feed intake were recorded every week. The level of estrogen and blood lipid was determined. The gene expressions and protein expressions of estrogen receptors (ERs), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) were determined. AAP treatment significantly decreased the body weight gain and average daily food intake of rats in the OVX group. Treatment with AAP significantly increased the relative weight of the uterus, plasma estrogen level, and the gene expression and protein expression of ER-α in the uterus. For blood lipids, plasma levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced by AAP treatment in OVX rats. AAP treatment decreased the expression of FAS and HMGR in the liver of OVX rats. Furthermore, AAP treatment significantly increased the gene expression of ACC2, the protein expression of P-ACC2, and the ratio of P-ACC2/ACC2. In summary, AAP treatment exerts beneficial effects on body weight gain and lipid metabolism disorder induced by ovariectomy through increasing estrogen levels, inhibiting FAS, and promoting fatty acid oxidation.",['Zhang P; Sun H; Yang D; Wang Y; Cheng J; Zeng C'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36516811,artemisia argyi polysaccharide has a beneficial effect on menstruation-related symptoms. it is expected to be a safe and effective ingredient for estrogen deficiency and lipid metabolic disorders.
Hormonal intrauterine devices and heat exchange during exercise.,"Synthetic progestins in oral contraceptives are thought to blunt heat dissipation by reducing skin blood flow and sweating. However, whether progestin-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) modulate heat loss during exercise-heat stress is unknown. We used direct calorimetry to measure whole-body total (dry + evaporative) heat loss in young, physically active women (mean (SD); aged 24 (4) years, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics> <msub><mover><mi>V</mi> <mo>̇</mo></mover> <mrow><msub><mi>O</mi> <mn>2</mn></msub> <mi>peak</mi></mrow> </msub> <annotation>${\dot V_{{{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{peak}}}}$</annotation></semantics> </math> 39.3 (5.3) ml/kg/min) with (IUD; n = 19) and without (Control; n = 17) IUDs in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle during light- and moderate-intensity exercise at fixed rates of heat production (∼175 and ∼275 W/m<sup>2</sup> ) in 30°C, ∼21% relative humidity. Between-group and -phase differences were evaluated using traditional hypothesis testing and statistical equivalence testing within pre-determined bounds (±11 W/m<sup>2</sup> ; difference required to elicit a ±0.3°C difference in core temperature over 1 h) in each exercise bout. Whole-body total heat loss was statistically equivalent between groups within ±11 W m<sup>-2</sup> (IUD-Control [90% CIs]; Light: -2 [-8, 5] W/m<sup>2</sup> , P = 0.007; Moderate: 0 [-6, 6] W/m<sup>2</sup> , P = 0.002), as were dry and evaporative heat loss (P ≤ 0.023), except for evaporative heat loss during moderate-intensity exercise (equivalence: P = 0.063, difference: P = 0.647). Whole-body total and evaporative heat loss were not different between phases (P ≥ 0.267), but dry heat loss was 3 [95% CIs: 1, 5] W/m<sup>2</sup> greater in the luteal phase (P ≤ 0.022). Despite this, all whole-body heat loss outcomes were equivalent between phases (P ≤ 0.003). These findings expand our understanding of the factors that modulate heat exchange in women and provide valuable mechanistic insight of the role of endogenous and exogenous female sex hormones in thermoregulation. KEY POINTS: Progestin released by hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) may negatively impact heat dissipation during exercise by blunting skin blood flow and sweating. However, the influence of IUDs on thermoregulation has not previously been assessed. We used direct calorimetry to show that IUD users and non-users display statistically equivalent whole-body dry and evaporative heat loss, body heat storage and oesophageal temperature during moderate- and high-intensity exercise in a warm, dry environment, indicating that IUDs do not appear to compromise exercise thermoregulation. However, within IUD users and non-users, dry heat loss was increased and body heat storage and oesophageal temperature were reduced in the luteal compared to the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, though these effects were small and unlikely to be practically meaningful. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the factors that modulate heat exchange in women and have important practical implications for the design of future studies of exercise thermoregulation.",['Kirby NV; Meade RD; Richards BJ; Notley SR; Kenny GP'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38367251,"intrauterine devices (IUDs) modulate heat loss during exercise-heat stress. if progestins in oral contraceptives, they can reduce heat dissipation."
Effects of hormone replacement therapy on glucose and lipid metabolism in peri- and postmenopausal women with a history of menstrual disorders.,"Previous studies have indicated that women with a history of menstrual disorders have an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This has been attributed to the high proportion of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among this group. The favorable effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on serum lipid profiles and glucose homeostasis in postmenopausal women is widely accepted. Whether HRT can also show positive effects on metabolic homeostasis in menopausal women with prior menstrual disorders (a putative PCOS phenotype) has not been reported yet. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of HRT on glucose and lipid metabolism in peri- and postmenopausal women with prior menstrual disorders and controls who did not have prior menstrual disorders. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted including 595 peri- and postmenopausal women who received HRT at four hospitals in the Zhejiang Province from May 31, 2010 to March 8, 2021. Participants were divided into the Normal menstruation group and the Menstrual disorders group according to their prior usual menstrual cycle pattern. Glucose and lipid metabolism indicators were assessed at baseline and after HRT. The results were compared between and within the groups, and data from peri- and postmenopausal women were analyzed separately. HRT significantly decreased fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in perimenopausal users, and fasting plasma glucose levels in postmenopausal users with prior menstrual disorders, compared with baseline. Furthermore, HRT decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, fasting insulin, fasting plasma glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in both peri- and postmenopausal controls, compared with baseline. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in any of the glucose or lipid metabolism indicators at baseline and follow-up, as well as changes from baseline levels between menopausal women with and without prior menstrual disorders. HRT shows more obvious within-group improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism in controls, but there is no significant between-group difference. Further prospective studies are required for confirmation.",['Li S; Ma L; Song Y; Zheng J; Cai Y; Xu H; Chen P; Xu W; Huang Y; Qi T; Li C; Chu K; Lan Y; Xu L; Zhou J'],2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34130678,women with a history of menstrual disorders have increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. favorable effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on serum lipid profiles and glucose homeostasis in postmenopausal women with prior menstrual disorders (a putative PCOS phenotype) has not been reported yet.
Factors contributing to stillbirth in young hyper-prolific sows in a tropical free-farrowing system.,"The present study investigated factors associated with the incidence of stillbirth in young hyper-prolific sows within free farrowing systems in tropical environments. A total of 714 live-born and 54 stillborn piglets from 57 Landrace × Yorkshire sows, with an average parity of 2.7 ± 1.0 (range: 1 - 4), were comprehensively investigated. Reproductive variables of the sows, including gestation length, farrowing duration, the total number of piglets born per litter, and the birth order and status of each piglet, were recorded. Differences in the physiological characteristics of live-born and stillborn piglets, such as birth interval, cumulative birth interval, body weight at birth, crown-rump length, body mass index (BMI), ponderal index (PI), meconium staining score, and the percentage of piglets with a broken umbilical cord, were analysed. Piglets were divided into four groups based on the quartiles of birth order (Q1-Q4). On average, the duration of farrowing was 173.3 ± 85.9 min, and the total number of piglets born and number of piglets born alive-per litter were 14.1 ± 3.8 and 12.5 ± 3.5, respectively. The incidence of stillbirth was 6.7% (54/801 piglets). The higher percentages of stillbirths were detected in sows with large litter sizes (≥17 piglets, 10.9%) compared to those with small (≤13 piglets, 6.1%) and moderate (14 - 16 piglets, 2.8%) litter sizes (p < .001). The incidences of stillbirth in Q3 and Q4 of the litters were higher than in Q1 and Q2 (p < .001). Compared to live-born piglets, stillborn piglets had higher cumulative birth interval (103.0 ± 3.71 vs. 142.4 ± 9.35 min, p < .001), BMI (17.1 ± 0.15 vs. 18.4 ± 0.39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = .002), PI (63.7 ± 0.59 vs. 70.8 ± 1.59 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, p < .001), meconium staining scores (1.78 ± 0.04 vs. 2.04 ± 0.10, p = .021), and the percentage of piglets born with a ruptured umbilical cord (45.2% vs. 66.0%, p = .004). An increase in the incidence of stillbirth was detected at 60, 120, 150, 180, and ≥ 210 min after the first piglet was born, compared to those born within the first 30 min of farrowing (p < .05). In conclusion, the study found that stillbirths in young, hyper-prolific sows were linked to several factors: large litter sizes (≥17 piglets per litter), prolonged cumulative birth intervals (142.4 min), elevated BMI of 18.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, high PI values of 70.8 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, increased meconium staining scores, and a higher occurrence of ruptured umbilical cords. To reduce the risk of stillbirth, particularly among piglets with high body indices born later in the birthing process, it is recommended to enhance farrowing supervision for young sows, starting at a cumulative birth interval of 60 min.",['Ngo C; Boonprakob R; Tummaruk P'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39091012,study investigated factors associated with stillbirth in young hyper-prolific sows. piglets were divided into four groups based on birth order. incidence of stillbirth was 6.7% (54/801 piglets)
Interaction of sleep and emotion across the menstrual cycle.,"Menstruating individuals experience an increased risk for sleep and affective disorders, attributed in part to monthly oscillations in sex hormones. Emotional functioning and sleep continuity worsens during the perimenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. This study examined the interactive effects of sleep, menstrual phase, and emotion in healthy women. Participants (N = 51, 43% Caucasian) aged 18-35 (m = 24 years) completed actigraphy and daily sleep/emotion diaries over two menstrual cycles (m days = 51.29). Diary and actigraphic total wake time at night (TWT) and daily ratings of positive and negative affect were compared across four phases of the menstrual cycle: perimenstrual, mid-follicular, periovulatory, and mid-luteal. Relationships between phase, sleep, and emotion were estimated using multistep hierarchical linear modelling. Mean menstrual cycle length was 28.61 ± 2.69 days. Perimenstrual phase positively predicted anger (p < 0.001) but no other emotions. Additionally, the perimenstrual phase predicted higher rates of TWT, such that diary TWT was 8-16 min longer during the perimenstrual (m = 67.54, SE = 3.37) compared to other phases (p < 0.001). Actigraphic TWT was also increased by 4-7 min (m = 61.54, SE = 3.37) in the perimenstrual phase (p < 0.001). Positive emotions were 0.05-0.10 points lower (p = 0.006-0.02) when TWT was greater in the perimenstrual phase. Greater rates of anger and sleep disruption were seen during the perimenstrual phase compared with other phases. When poor sleep occurred during the perimenstrual phase individuals reported reduced positive emotions. Reducing perimenstrual sleep disruptions may be an important intervention target for those at risk for affective disorders.",['Meers JM; Bower J; Nowakowski S; Alfano C'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38513350,menstruating individuals experience an increased risk for sleep and affective disorders. perimenstrual phase positively predicted anger but no other emotions. perimenstrual phase positively predicted anger (p  0.001) but no other emotions.
Accumulation of liposomes in metastatic tumor sites is not necessary for anti-cancer drug efficacy.,"The tumor microenvironment is profoundly heterogeneous particularly when comparing sites of metastases. Establishing the extent of this heterogeneity may provide guidance on how best to design lipid-based drug delivery systems to treat metastatic disease. Building on our previous research, the current study employs a murine model of metastatic cancer to explore the distribution of ~ 100 nm liposomes. Female NCr nude mice were inoculated with a fluorescently labeled, Her2/neu-positive, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell line, JIMT-1<sup>mkate</sup>, either in the mammary fat pad to create an orthotopic tumor (OT), or via intracardiac injection (IC) to establish tumors throughout the body. Animals were dosed with fluorescent and radio-labeled liposomes. In vivo and ex vivo fluorescent imaging was used to track liposome distribution over a period of 48 h. Liposome distribution in orthotopic tumors was compared to sites of tumor growth that arose following IC injection. A significant amount of inter-vessel heterogeneity for DiR distribution was observed, with most tumor blood vessels showing little to no presence of the DiR-labelled liposomes. Further, there was limited extravascular distribution of DiR liposomes in the perivascular regions around DiR-positive vessels. While all OT tumors contained at least some DiR-positive vessels, many metastases had very little or none. Despite the apparent limited distribution of liposomes within metastases, two liposomal drug formulations, Irinophore C and Doxil, showed similar efficacy for both the OT and IC JIMT-1<sup>mkate</sup> models. These findings suggest that liposomal formulations achieve therapeutic benefits through mechanisms that extend beyond the enhanced permeability and retention effect.",['Kalra J; Baker J; Sun X; Kyle A; Minchinton A; Bally MB'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38961395,tumor microenvironment is profoundly heterogeneous especially when comparing sites of metastases. a murine model of metastatic cancer uses a murine model of metastatic cancer to explore the distribution of  100 nm liposomes.
Influence of endogenous and exogenous hormones on the cardiovascular response to lower extremity exercise and group III/IV activation in young females.,"Oral contraceptive (OC) use can increase resting blood pressure (BP) in females as well as contribute to greater activation of group III/IV afferents during upper body exercise. It is unknown, however, whether an exaggerated BP response occurs during lower limb exercise in OC users. We sought to elucidate the group III/IV afferent activity-mediated BP and heart rate responses, while performing lower extremity tasks during early and late follicular phases in young, healthy females. Females not taking OCs (NOC: n=8; age: 25±4 years) and taking OCs (OC: n=10; age: 23±2 years) completed a continuous knee extension/flexion passive stretch (mechanoreflex) and cycling exercise with sub-systolic cuff occlusion (exercise pressor reflex), which was followed by a two-minute post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) (metaboreflex). Data collection occurred on two occasions: once during the early follicular phase (days 1-4) and once during the late follicular phase (days 10-14) of their menstrual cycle (NOC), or during the placebo and active pill phases (OC). Resting mean arterial BP and heart rate were not different between phases in NOC and OC participants (<i>p</i>>0.05). Hemodynamic responses to metaboreflex, mechanoreflex, and collective exercise pressor reflex activation were not different between phases in both groups (<i>p</i>>0.05). In conclusion, although OCs are known to increase BP at rest, our findings indicate that neither endogenous nor exogenous (OC) sex hormones modulate BP during large, lower-limb muscle exercise, with or without group III/IV afferent activation in young, healthy females.",['Asirvatham-Jeyaraj N; Anselmo M; Chantigian DP; Larson M; Lee EJ; Keller-Ross ML'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39034814,OC users can increase resting blood pressure and increase activation of group III/IV afferents during upper body exercise. it is unknown whether an exaggerated BP response occurs during lower limb exercise in OC users.
The Quality of Life of and Social Determinants Affecting Menopausal Women in Aseer's Healthy Cities in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Introduction Menopause is an important period in a woman's life. It is the permanent cessation of menses for 12 months or more. Menopause can develop over a long period of time. The average age for menopause to start is 52 years, but it can begin at any time from age 40 to 58 years. Many symptoms are related to postmenopausal syndrome: hot flashes, irritability, mood swings, insomnia, dry vagina, difficulty concentrating, mental confusion, stress incontinence, urge incontinence, osteoporotic symptoms, depression, headache, and vasomotor symptoms. Quality of life (QOL) has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an ""individual's perceptions of their position in life in the context of the cultural and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns."" Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among participants from Aseer's Healthy Cities. The sample was calculated using the formula of Swinscow and Cohen, and a total of 823 main cities were the target sample size. The sample was simply picked at random from October to December 2021. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)-related questionnaire is used to evaluate the symptoms of menopause in people who answer the questions themselves. Result The study included 869 participants, 98.3% of which are Saudi nationals. Of the participants, 82.1% were married. As regards the lifestyle of the participants in the study, 69% live with a husband and children. The mean age of the study participants was 42.5 (standard deviation (SD): 8.883) years. The mean number of participants with somatic vasomotor symptoms was 0.74 (SD: 94). The majority of the participants have sleep issues such as difficulty falling asleep, difficulty sleeping through the night, and waking up early (mean: 0.97, SD: 1.3), followed by hot flashes and sweating (mean: 0.65, SD: 1.165), and heart discomfort (mean: 0.63, SD: 12). Psychosocial symptoms are also common (mean: 0.95, SD: 1.16); the majority have depressive moods (mean: 1.09, SD: 1.35), followed by irritability (mean: 0.93, SD: 1.2), and anxiety (mean: 0.84, SD: 1.22). Physical symptoms are also prevalent, with a mean and SD of 0.91 and 1.03, respectively, with bladder problems having a mean and SD of 0.55 and 1.017, respectively. Finally, there were also sexual symptoms (mean: 0.70, SD: 1.09), with sexual problems having a mean and SD of 0.81 and 1.28, respectively. Conclusion The study found a high percentage of unawareness about menopause and a need to improve healthcare access and symptomatic treatment. The regression model of psychosocial risk factors is found to have a significant association with the increase of symptoms and using other medications for any reason, menstrual cycle pattern, and marital status.",['Barkoot S; Saeed A; AlMetrek M; AlShahrani S; A lHomedi H; AlShahrani A; AlQahtani O; AlShehri S'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36465193,menopause can develop over a long period of time. the average age for menopause to start is 52 years. symptoms are related to postmenopausal syndrome.
Factors that impact on the perception of menstruation among female adolescents.,"It has been described that menstruation is perceived as a natural but cumbersome event, with a negative impact on women's daily life. The objective of this study was to identify the perception of menstruation among female adolescents and the factors that may affect it. Observational, crosssectional, comparative study in postmenarcheal adolescents with and without chronic conditions in two children's hospitals and two primary and secondary schools. Age, education level, type of population, date of menarche, and presence of dysmenorrhea were recorded. A previously validated questionnaire was administered to assess the perception of menstruation. A total of 346 female adolescents were included. The most common perception of menstruation was negative in 65.6 % (n = 227), positive in 16 % (n = 55), discreet in 13 % (n = 45), and indefinite in 5.4 % (n = 19). The presence of a chronic condition demonstrated to be a protective factor against a negative perception of menstruation (odds ratio: 0.4 [95 % confidence interval: 0.20-0.78], p = 0.007). More than half of female adolescents had a negative attitude toward menstruation, but the presence of a chronic condition improved it.",['Serret-Montoya J; Villasís-Keever MA; Mendoza-Rojas MO; Granados-Canseco F; Zúñiga-Partida EA; Zurita-Cruz JN'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32199048,"menstruation is perceived as a natural but cumbersome event. the most common perception of menstruation was negative in 65.6 % (n = 227), positive in 16 % (n = 55), discreet in 13 % (n = 45) and indefinite in 5.4 % (n = 19)."
A narrative inquiry into women's experiences of menstruation at the workplace in Namibia.,"Menstruation's effects on workplace productivity and its impact on women's careers are rarely discussed in public discourse. This paper presents an analysis of thirteen women's accounts of their menstrual experiences at work. The study aimed to understand women's lived experiences of menstruation in the workplace in Namibia and to make recommendations for best practices and policy formulation to help female employees cope with menstruation at work in Namibia. The study adopted a qualitative, phenomenological narrative inquiry research design, and thirteen participants working in various institutions and companies in Namibia were selected through a snowball sampling procedure. Individuals who agreed to participate in the study were given a link to a Google document containing reflective questions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the narratives. The study findings show that most participants experienced various menstrual-related symptoms ranging from unbearable physical pain or discomfort to heavy bleeding and psychological distress. Menstruating women face workplace challenges, such as a lack of emergency sanitary products and unsupportive superiors. Based on the narratives analyzed, we conclude that menstrual-related symptoms affect work productivity. Participants highlighted that they perform better and are considerably more productive on their non-menstrual days. Participants advocated for a shift in policy to allow flexibility to work from home or get menstrual leave when experiencing severe menstrual symptoms. Such a change will go a long way in making the workplace more accommodating to women.",['Mbongo EN; Miranda H; Haikera H'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37753433,narrative inquiry aimed to understand women's menstrual experiences at work. participants were selected through a snowball sampling procedure.
"Tracking the little ones: use of fluorescent powder to follow a leaf litter lizard (Coleodactylus meridionalis, Squamata: Sphaerodactylidae) in the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, Brazil.","The ecology of movement is an expanding area, marked by the diversity of analytical methods and protocols, which enables this integrative reading. We investigated movement ecology aspects of Coleodactylus meridionalis in southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil, using fluorescent powder with mineral oil to track individuals. We monitored 69 individuals of C. meridionalis that walked an average distance of 148 cm in 2h. We identified this movement as foraging due to the orientation of the step sequence and microenvironments used. We find no significant differences between walking distance and weight. However, we found a decrease in activity over the follow-up period. Most of the lizard's movements were directed north, while south, east, and west were followed equally. The individuals stayed predominantly on the ground (leaf litter), but it was possible to observe the use of other surfaces, such as trunks and burrows on the ground. Therefore, we studied the movement in three dimensions (ground height, distance traveled, and orientation of steps). We observed the lizard's foraging, one of the most common and least investigated movements in small lizards like C. meridionalis. This involves not only the species' activity schedule but other intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape the movement decisions of individuals.",['Roseno RS; Pareja-Mejía D; Santos LSD; Diele-Viegas LM; Carilo Filho LM; Nascimento PR; Eidenberger GG; Solé M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38922256,"lizards used fluorescent powder to track individuals in southern Bahia, northeastern brazil. we monitored 69 individuals of a leaf litter lizard that walked an average distance of 148 cm in 2h."
[Analysis of Reproductive Tract Microecological Changes During the Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer Cycle and Clinical Pregnancy Outcomes].,"This study aims to analyze the relationship between reproductive tract microecological changes, metabolic differences, and pregnancy outcomes at different time points in the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle while patients are undergoing hormone replacement therapy, which will be a breakthrough point for improving outcomes. A total of 20 women undergoing frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfer for the first time at the Reproductive Medicine Center of Fujian Maternal and Child Health Hospital between July 2022 and January 2023 were recruited for this study. Their vaginal and cervical secretions were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics analysis on days 2-5 of menstruation, day 7 after estrogen replacement therapy started, the day when progesterone was added, and the day of transplantation. The subjects were divided into different groups according to their clinical pregnancy status and the sequencing results were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. 1) The alpha-diversity index of the vaginal and cervical microbiota was higher on days 2-5 of menstruation (<i>P</i><0.01), but did not differ significantly on day 7 after oral estrogen replacement therapy started, the day of progesterone administration, and the day of transplantation (<i>P</i>≥0.1). 2) Both the pregnant group and the non-pregnant group showed a variety of microorganisms and metabolites with significant differences in the lower reproductive tract at different time points. 3) Microbial analysis at different time points showed that there were significant differences in vaginal flora, including <i>Peptoniphilus</i>, <i>Enterocloster</i>, <i>Finegoldia</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Anaerobutyricum</i>, <i>Agathobaculum</i>, <i>Sporanaerobacter</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Anaerococcus</i> in the pregnant group (<i>P</i><0.05). 4) Metabolite analysis at different time points showed that there were significant differences in 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, linatine, (R)-amphetamine, hydroxychloroquine, and L-altarate in the vaginal secretions of the pregnant group (<i>P</i><0.05), and that there were significant differences in isocitric acid, quassin, citrinin, and 12(R)-HETE in the cervical secretions (<i>P</i><0.05). 5) Metabolite analysis at different time points showed that, in the non-pregnant group, there were significant differences in linatine, decanoyl-L-carnitine, aspartame, sphingosine, and hydroxychloroquine in the vaginal secretions (<i>P</i><0.05), and the isocitric acid, quassin, ctrinin, and 12(R)-HETE in the cervical secretions (<i>P</i><0.05). 6) Combined microbiome and metabolomics analysis showed that certain metabolites were significantly associated with microbial communities, especially <i>Klebsiella</i>. Significant differences in the microbiota genera and metabolites at different time points were found during the frozen-embryo transfer cycle of hormone replacement therapy, which may be used as potential biomarkers to predict pregnancy outcomes of embryo transfer.",['Yang X; Cai X; Tang J; Huang Y; Wu M; Liu K; Chen Y; Sun Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38948288,"study aims to analyze relationship between reproductive tract microecological changes, metabolic differences, and pregnancy outcomes at different time points in the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle. a total of 20 women undergoing frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfer for the first time were recruited for this study."
United States Marine Corps Recruit Training Demands Associated With Performance Outcomes.,"United States Marine Corps' (USMC) recruit training is a 13-week program designed to maximize physical and mental performance adaptations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the training demands and characteristics that are associated with performance outcomes during USMC recruit training. A total of 196 recruits (M = 97 and W = 99) were monitored and tested throughout training. Laboratory-based performance testing occurred at the start of weeks 2 and 11 and consisted of body mass assessments, countermovement vertical jump, and isometric mid-thigh pull. Military-specific performance testing occurred twice within the first 8 weeks of training and included the physical fitness test (PFT) and combat fitness test (CFT) implemented by the USMC. Resilience data were collected at week 2 using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Workload, sleep, and stress responses were monitored at weeks 2, 7, and 11. Recruits were provided with a wearable tracking device which utilized heart rate and accelerometry-based technology to determine energy expenditure (EE), distances (DIS), and sleep metrics. Data were averaged over a 3-day period. Salivary cortisol testing occurred at the start of each monitoring week. Change scores were calculated for performance tests, and body mass was calculated from data obtained at week 2 to week 11. Area under the curve was calculated for the workload, sleep metrics, and cortisol responses using the trapezoidal method. Pearson product-moment correlations (r) were used to assess the relationships between training demands and performance. An α level of 0.05 was used to establish significance. A moderate positive correlation was found between changes in body mass and peak power (P < .001; r = 0.43). Weak positive correlations were found between changes in body mass and peak force (P = .002; r = 0.28), as well as body mass and resilience (P = .03; r = 0.19). A moderate negative correlation was observed between changes in body mass and PFT (P < .001; r = -0.49). A weak negative correlation was found between changes in body mass and EE (P = .003; r = -0.24). A weak negative correlation was found between changes in peak power and EE (P = .001; r = -0.29). A weak positive correlation was found between changes in peak power and changes in CFT (P = .05; r = 0.19) A weak negative correlation was found between changes in sleep continuity and CFT (P = .02; r = -0.20). A weak negative correlation was found between cortisol and changes in PFT (P = .05; r = -0.20). A weak negative correlation was found between cortisol and both EE (P = .001; r = -0.27) and DIS (P = .045; r = -0.16). A weak negative correlation was found between EE and sleep continuity (P < .001; r = -0.34). Weak negative correlations were found between sleep duration and both DIS (P = .01; r = -0.18) and steps (P = .003; r = -0.21).

Menstrual education programs for girls and young women with intellectual and developmental disabilities: A systematic review.,Providing menstrual education and guidance for menstrual management for girls and young women with intellectual disabilities is recommended to ensure smooth pubertal transitions and to support menstrual self-agency. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore menstrual education interventions for girls and young women with intellectual disabilities. Nine studies were included. Interventions were provided in small groups (n = 4) and individually (n = 5). Most studies used dolls (n = 7) and task analysis (n = 7) to teach pad-replacement skills. All reported significant improvements in participant skills and/or knowledge following the intervention. Only one study addressed self-agency and self-esteem as an outcome of the intervention. Menstrual education for girls and young women with intellectual disabilities is largely focused on pad-replacement skills. Further research is needed to understand the impact of menstrual health and hygiene education on variables apart from skill improvement such as self-agency and long-term health outcomes related to menstrual health.,['Randall KN; Hopkins CS; Drew H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38863161,menstrual education interventions for girls and young women with intellectual disabilities are recommended to ensure smooth pubertal transitions. nine studies included. interventions were provided in small groups (n = 4) and individually (n = 5)
Menstrual cycle tracking in professional volleyball athletes.,"The menstrual cycle may affect well-being and physical performance of elite female athletes by interfering with the function of multiple physiological systems. The aim of this study was to characterize the symptoms of the menstrual cycle and their frequency in elite female volleyball players. Twenty professional female volleyball players were instructed to track their menstrual symptoms over the course of the first German national league season using the FitrWoman® tracking app. The app recorded the cycle length, duration, and intensity of the period as well as the occurrence and frequency of frequent cycle symptoms. The reported symptoms were then categorized into four categories (frequently, sometimes, rare, never) in order to create an individual Menstrual Symptom index (MSi) for each athlete. The most frequently occurring symptoms among all players without hormonal contraception (non-HC; <i>n</i> = 15) were ""stomach cramps"" (<i>n</i> = 15), ""sleep disturbances"" (<i>n</i> = 11), and ""tiredness"" (<i>n</i> = 11). The average number of symptoms counted per cycle was 11.8 (±17.7) and the average calculated MSi within the team was 12.9 (±10.7) points for non-HC users. The HC players (<i>n</i> = 4) also regularly experienced symptoms such as ""sleep disturbances"" or ""tendered breasts"". The most common symptoms ""stomach cramps"" and ""disturbed sleep"" occurred more frequently during menstruation, while symptoms such as ""bloating"", ""cravings"" or ""tendered breasts"" did also peak before menstruation. Menstrual cycle symptoms can be highly individual within a professional sports team. The calculation of the MSi seems to be a simple and accessible method to describe and overview the intensity and prevalence of symptoms in top female athletes in sports games.",['Roffler A; Fleddermann MT; de Haan H; Krüger K; Zentgraf K'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39005625,menstrual cycle tracking in professional volleyball players. the menstrual cycle may affect well-being and physical performance of elite female athletes. the study was based on the FitrWoman® tracking app.
Evaluating Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) for passive monitoring of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS).,"Detection and monitoring of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aquatic environments has become an increasingly higher priority of regulatory agencies as public concern for human intake of these chemicals continues to grow. While many methods utilize active sampling strategies (""grab samples"") for precise PFAS quantitation, here we evaluate the efficacy of low-cost passive sampling devices (Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking, or SPATTs) for spatial and temporal PFAS assessment of aquatic systems. For this study, passive samplers were initially deployed in North Carolina along the Cape Fear River during the summer and fall of 2016 and 2017. These were originally intended for the detection of microcystins and monitoring potentially harmful algal blooms, though this period also coincided with occurrences of PFAS discharge from a local fluorochemical manufacturer into the river. Additional samplers were then deployed in 2022 to evaluate changes in PFAS fingerprint and abundances. Assessment of PFAS showed legacy compounds were observed across almost all sampling sites over all 3 years (PFHxS, PFOS, PFHxA, etc.), while emerging replacement PFAS (e.g., Nafion byproducts) were predominantly localized downstream from the manufacturer. Furthermore, samplers deployed downstream from the manufacturer in 2022 noted sharp decreases in observed signal for replacement PFAS in comparison to samplers deployed in 2016 and 2017, indicating mitigation and remediation efforts in the area were able to reduce localized fluorochemical contamination.",['Dodds JN; Kirkwood-Donelson KI; Boatman AK; Knappe DRU; Hall NS; Schnetzer A; Baker ES'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38981548,passive samplers were initially deployed in north Carolina along the Cape Fear River. they were intended for the detection of microcystins and monitoring potentially harmful algal blooms. this period coincided with PFAS discharge from a local fluorochemical manufacturer into the river.
"Child marriage and quality of marriage among young married women in a rural district, Lorestan Province, Iran.","Child marriage remains a significant socio-cultural phenomenon with profound implications for the quality of marital relationships, particularly among young women. This study investigates the association between child marriage and the quality of marriage among young married women in Iran. This study employed a population-based cross-sectional research design. A total of 70 young women, aged 18-20 years, who had married before reaching 18 years of age, were selected from four primary health care (PHC) centers in Papi District, Lorestan Province, Iran, employing a systematic random sampling approach. Subjects were categorized into women experiencing relationship distress and those without such distress using the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI). Concurrently, their level of sexual satisfaction was assessed utilizing the Hudson's Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS). Furthermore, Social Support was evaluated using the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ). The mean age (SD) of women was 18.9 (0.7) years, and their mean age (SD) of marriage was 15.2 (2.1) years. Women experiencing distress showed significant differences in age of menarche (P = 0.006), education levels (P = 0.039), spouses' education (P = 0.025), spouses' occupations (P = 0.004), household income satisfaction (P = 0.041), and household structure (P = 0.045). Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis revealed significant and positive correlations between sexual self-efficacy and social support with marital quality (r = 0.73, p < 0.001 and r = 0.55, p < 0.001, respectively). Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between the score of indexes of sexual satisfaction and marital quality (r = -0.65, p < 0.001). These findings emphasize the complex factors affecting marital quality and underscore the urgent need for interventions to support young women in early marriages. It is essential to reinforce policies aimed at reducing child marriage to improve the quality of marriage among young married women.",['Zolfaghary F; Agajani-Delavar M; Adib-Rad H; Bakouei F; Kazem-Aslani M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39095831,"child marriage remains a significant socio-cultural phenomenon. study investigated the association between child marriage and quality of marriage among young married women in a rural district, Lorestan Province, Iran."

"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, and Energy Restricted Diets in Female Athletes.","Female athletes who follow a diet that fails to meet energy and nutrient needs are at risk for musculoskeletal injuries, menstrual disturbances, and poor sports performance. Common nutritional concerns for the female athlete include low energy availability (EA) (i.e., energy intake from food remaining for metabolic processes after accounting for energy expended during exercise) and inadequate dietary intakes (i.e., not meeting sports nutrition guidelines) of carbohydrates, protein, essential fatty acids (EFAs), B-vitamins, calcium, iron, and vitamin D. Low EA and the associated nutrient deficiencies are more common in athletes who compete in weight-sensitive sports (i.e., aesthetic, gravitational, and weight category sports) because low body fat and mass confer a competitive advantage. Other athletes at risk for energy and nutrient deficits include athletes following a vegetarian or gluten-free diet (GFD). Careful dietary planning can help an athlete meet energy and nutrient needs. This review covers the nutrition issues associated with low EA and special diets (i.e., vegetarian and GFD) and describes strategies to help female athletes meet their energy and nutrient needs.",['Cialdella-Kam L; Kulpins D; Manore MM'],2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29910298,"female athletes at risk for musculoskeletal injuries, menstrual disturbances, and poor sports performance. low energy availability (EA) and inadequate dietary intakes of carbohydrates, protein, essential fatty acids (EFAs), B-vitamins, calcium, iron, and vitamin D are common in athletes who compete in weight-sensitive sports."
Kirigami enabled reconfigurable three-dimensional evaporator arrays for dynamic solar tracking and high efficiency desalination.,"A kirigami-engineered composite hydrogel membrane is exploited for the construction of three dimensional (3D) solar-tracking evaporator arrays with outstanding evaporation performance and salt tolerance. The hybrid nanofiber network in the hydrogel membrane offers favorable water transport dynamics combined with excellent structural robustness, which are beneficial for the engineering of 3D dynamic structures. Periodic triangular cuts patterned into the membrane allow formation and reconfiguration of 3D conical arrays controlled by uniaxial stretching. With these structures, the tilt angles of the membrane surface are actively tuned to follow the solar trajectory, leading to a solar evaporation rate ~80% higher than that of static planar devices. Furthermore, the tapered 3D flaps and their micro-structured surfaces are capable of localized salt crystallization for prolonged solar desalination, enabling a stable evaporation rate of 3.4 kg m<sup>-2</sup> hour<sup>-1</sup> even in saturated brine. This versatile design may facilitate the implementation of solar evaporators for desalination and provide inspirations for other soft functional devices with dynamic 3D configurations.",['Li H; Zhang W; Liao X; Xu L'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38924404,kirigami-engineered composite hydrogel membrane is exploited for the construction of three dimensional (3D) solar-tracking evaporator arrays. the hybrid nanofiber network in the hydrogel membrane offers favorable water transport dynamics combined with excellent structural robustness.
Experimental study on migration characteristics of LNAPL in the aquitard under pumping conditions.,"Research on the migration behaviors of contaminants in the aquitard has been deficient for an extended period. Clay is commonly employed as an impermeable layer or barrier to stop the migration of contaminants. However, under certain conditions, the clay layer may exhibit permeability to water, thereby allowing contaminants to infiltrate and potentially contaminate adjacent aquifers. Consequently, it holds immense importance to scrutinize and investigate the migration characteristics of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) within the aquitard for the purposes of groundwater pollution control and remediation. To evaluate the environmental risk posed by organic contaminants in the aquitard, an experimental model was formulated and devised to monitor the LNAPL concentration in the aquitard under pumping conditions. The correlation between pumping rate and LNAPL concentration was investigated. A self-developed plexiglass sandbox model was used to simulate the migration characteristics of LNAPL in the aquitard under pumping conditions. Four experimental scenarios were designed, varying pumping rates, aquitard thicknesses, and groundwater level changes. The LNAPL concentration curve was derived by systematically tracking and analyzing LNAPL levels at various locations within the aquitard. The results indicated that higher pumping rates corresponded to increased migration of LNAPL, resulting in greater LNAPL ingress into the pumping well during extraction. A thicker aquitard demonstrated a more pronounced inhibitory effect on LNAPL, leading to an extended penetration time of LNAPL within the aquitard. The drawdown within the aquitard exerted a discernible influence on LNAPL migration, with the LNAPL concentration continuing to decrease in tandem with declining water levels during pumping. These research findings can establish a scientific foundation for the control and remediation of contaminants within aquitards.",['Su Y; Huang Y; Shen H'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38980487,study on migration characteristics of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) in the aquitard under pumping conditions. plexiglass sandbox model was used to simulate migration characteristics of LNAPL in the aquitard.
Factors associated with the health and reproductive autonomy of Quilombola women in Brazil.,"To verify the association between reproductive autonomy and sociodemographic, sexual, and reproductive characteristics in Quilombola women (a term indicating the origin of politically organized concentrations of Afro-descendants who emancipated themselves from slavery). Cross-sectional and analytical study with 160 women from Quilombola communities in the southwest of Bahia, Brazil. Data were collected using the Reproductive Autonomy Scale and the questionnaire from the National Health Survey (adapted). Out of the 160 participating women, 91.9% declared themselves as black, one out of every three were aged ≤ 23 years, 53.8% were married or had a partner, 38.8% had studied for ≤ 4 years, over half (58.1%) were unemployed, only 32.4% had a monthly income > R$ 430 (80 US dollars), 52.5% had their first menstruation at the age of 12, 70.7% had not accessed family planning services in the last 12 months, and over half used some method to avoid pregnancy (59.0%). The women had a high level of reproductive autonomy, especially in the ""Decision-making"" and ""Freedom from coercion"" subscales with a score of 2.53 and 3.40, respectively. A significant association (p<0.05) was found between the ""Total reproductive autonomy"" score and marital status, indicating that single or unpartnered women had higher autonomy compared to married or partnered women. The association of social determinants of health such as marital status, education, and age impacts women's reproductive choices, implying risks for sexual and reproductive health.

"Knowledge, experiences, and practices of women affected by female genital schistosomiasis in rural Madagascar: A qualitative study on disease perception, health impairment and social impact.","Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected manifestation of urogenital schistosomiasis caused by S. haematobium. The disease presents with symptoms such as pelvic pain, vaginal discharge and bleeding and menstruation disorders, and might lead to infertility and pregnancy complications. The perspectives of women with FGS have not been studied systematically. The aim of the study was to understand knowledge, experiences, and practices of women with FGS. We performed a qualitative study with seventy-six women diagnosed of having FGS, in the Ambanja district in Northwest Madagascar. Data collection was either through focus group discussion (N = 60) or in an individual semi-structured interview (N = 16). FGS was diagnosed by colposcopy. The data was analysed using Mayring´s qualitative content analysis. Knowledge on how the disease is acquired varied and ideas on prevention remained vague. Patients suffered from vaginal discharge and pelvic complaints. Some women expressed unbearable pain during sexual intercourse and compared their pain to an open wound being touched. FGS considerably impaired women´s daily activities and their quality of life. Infertility led to resignation and despair, conflicts with the partner and to social exclusion from the community. Women fearing to sexually transmit FGS refrained from partnership and sexual relations. Many women with FGS reported stigmatisation. A coping strategy was to share strain with other women having similar complaints. However, concealing FGS was a common behaviour which led to social isolation and delayed health care seeking. Our study underlines that FGS has an important impact on the sexual health of women and on their social life in the community. Our results highlight the importance of providing adequate health education and structural interventions, such as the supply of water and the provision of sanitation measures. Further, correct diagnosis and treatment of FGS in adolescent girls and women should be available in all S. haematobium-endemic areas. The qualitative study was embedded in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which two doses of praziquantel were compared (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04115072).",['Schuster A; Randrianasolo BS; Rabozakandraina OO; Ramarokoto CE; Brønnum D; Feldmeier H'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36342912,"female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected manifestation of urogenital schistosomiasis caused by S. haematobium. the disease presents with symptoms such as pelvic pain, vaginal discharge and bleeding and menstruation disorders."
A GnRH neuronal population in the olfactory bulb translates socially relevant odors into reproductive behavior in male mice.,"Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons regulate fertility and integrate hormonal status with environmental cues to ensure reproductive success. Here we show that GnRH neurons in the olfactory bulb (GnRH<sup>OB</sup>) of adult mice can mediate social recognition. Specifically, we show that GnRH<sup>OB</sup> neurons extend neurites into the vomeronasal organ and olfactory epithelium and project to the median eminence. GnRH<sup>OB</sup> neurons in males express vomeronasal and olfactory receptors, are activated by female odors and mediate gonadotropin release in response to female urine. Male preference for female odors required the presence and activation of GnRH<sup>OB</sup> neurons, was impaired after genetic inhibition or ablation of these cells and relied on GnRH signaling in the posterodorsal medial amygdala. GnRH receptor expression in amygdala kisspeptin neurons appear to be required for GnRH<sup>OB</sup> neurons' actions on male mounting behavior.

"Infertility-Related Stress, and Dyadic Coping as Predictors of Quality of Life: Gender Differences Among Couples with Infertility Issues.","The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between infertility-related stress and dyadic coping with quality of life (QoL) in couples with infertility issues, and verify gender differences and dyadic interactions in the associations between them. This cross-sectional study included 340 couples who were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Lanzhou University between March 2022 and November 2022. The Fertility Problem Inventory, Dyadic Coping Inventory and FertiQoL were used to measure infertility-related stress, dyadic coping and QoL. The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model was used to analyze the effects of infertility-related stress and dyadic coping on the couple's own QoL (actor effect) as well as on their partner's QoL (partner effect). Female patients perceived significantly lower levels of QoL and dyadic coping than those of husbands. There was no statistically significant difference in the infertility-related stress between wives and husbands. Husbands' infertility-related stress had actor and partner effects on their own and their wives' QoL, while wives' infertility-related stress only had an actor effect on their own QoL. Husbands' dyadic coping had both actor effect and partner effects on their own and their wives' QoL, meanwhile wives' dyadic coping had both actor effect and partner effects on their own and their husbands' QoL. Husbands' QoL was impacted by their own infertility-related stress, dyadic coping and their wives' dyadic coping. Whereas wives' QoL was influenced by infertility-related stress and dyadic coping from both their own and their spouses. Therefore, elevating the level of dyadic coping may contribute to improving QoL for both husbands and wives. Moreover, enhancing the ability to cope with infertility-related stress might be useful for husbands and indirectly contribute to wives' QoL.",['Tang N; Pei M; Liu H; Chen J; Wang Y; Xie L; Hu J; Wang J; Gao Y'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39081285,infertility-related stress and dyadic coping with quality of life were used. the study was to examine the relationship between infertility-related stress and dyadic coping with quality of life.
Menstrual Cycle and Situational Match Variables: Effects on Well-Being in Professional Female Soccer Players.,"<b>Purpose:</b> We examined whether the situational match factors (location, result, and opposition quality), as well as playing position and menstrual cycle phase, influenced self-reported well-being in female soccer players. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-two professional players (25 ± 5 years) from a squad in the Women's Super League in England self-reported their menstrual cycle phase via an online survey, and their soreness, sleep, stress, mood, and fatigue on a 1 (positive) to 5 (negative) scale on the morning of match day (MD) and for the next 3 days (referred to as MD + 1, MD + 2, MD + 3, respectively). Data was collected for 26 matches across the 2021-2022 season. Session rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) and total distance covered (measured with GPS) were measured on match and training days. <b>Results:</b> Menstrual cycle phase and the situational match factors had no influence on distance covered during matches and sRPE (<i>p</i> > .05). Sleep was worse on MD + 1 (<i>p</i> < .001; <i>g</i> = 1.59) and MD + 2 (<i>p</i> = .005; <i>g</i> = 0.98) after away matches. Stress and mood were > 28% worse after playing top vs. mid and bottom table opposition at MD + 1, and significantly worse when losing compared to winning and drawing (<i>p</i> > .05). Playing position and menstrual cycle phase has no influence on self-reported well-being (<i>p</i> > .05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Sleep quality was worse after away matches and losing matches negatively affects stress and mood for 2 days post-match, but menstrual cycle phase does not influence post-match well-being.",['Abbott W; Exall Z; Walsh L; Clifford T'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38306676,"twenty-two professional players self-reported their menstrual cycle phase. they self-reported their soreness, sleep, stress, mood, and fatigue. a study was carried out on a 1 (positive) to 5 (negative) scale."
Menstrual Cycle Characteristics and Vulvodynia.,"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The menstrual cycle may influence vulvodynia through hormonal pathways or vulvar irritation due to menstruation or menstrual hygiene. We assessed menstrual cycle characteristics in those with and without clinically confirmed vulvodynia. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Participants were recruited from the administrative database of a health care network serving ∼27% of Minneapolis-Saint Paul residents. For 220 clinically confirmed cases and 224 controls, menstrual cycle characteristics were retrospectively assessed at three time points: before age 18, the year before onset of vulvar pain, and 3 months before study participation. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between menstrual characteristics at all three time points and vulvodynia. Models adjusted for prespecified confounders were evaluated against crude effect estimates. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Women with heavier menstrual flows had higher odds of vulvodynia compared with women with lighter menstrual flows during their adolescent years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.91-2.86), the year before onset of vulvar pain (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.10-4.02), and during the 3 months before study participation (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.91-3.06). Women with more severe cramps also had higher odds of vulvodynia compared with women with no or mild cramps during their adolescent years (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.45-4.15), the year before onset of vulvar pain (OR = 3.30, 95% CI 1.67-6.51), and during the 3 months before study participation (OR = 4.96, 95% CI 1.99-12.36). Women with specific premenstrual symptoms also reported higher odds of vulvodynia. Among those with vulvodynia, half reported a change in vulvar pain across the menstrual cycle, with 60% of these reporting greater pain just before and during menstruation. Furthermore, we observe a trend of decreased tampon use and increased use of sanitary pads as women with vulvodynia moved closer to their date of diagnosis. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Menstrual cycle characteristics were associated with vulvodynia, and associations were consistent across different phases of the reproductive life cycle.",['Estibeiro V; Juntunen A; Bond JC; Harlow BL'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35041490,menstrual cycle characteristics were retrospectively assessed at three time points. women with heavier menstrual flows had higher odds of vulvodynia compared with women with lighter menstrual flows.
Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment and Psychosocial Management of Dysmenorrhea.,"Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is a common cause of acute pelvic pain that affects approximately two-thirds of women who are postmenarchal in the United States. Dysmenorrhea pain is frequently severe enough to disrupt daily activities and often accompanied by other symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Primary dysmenorrhea is likely due to an excess of prostaglandins and is traditionally treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal therapy. Secondary dysmenorrhea can have multiple origins and requires targeted therapy. Currently, musculoskeletal dysfunction and psychosocial factors are not listed as causes of secondary dysmenorrhea. The authors present a case in which the cause of secondary dysmenorrhea was thought to be related to both musculoskeletal dysfunction and emotional stress. Osteopathic manipulative treatment and lifestyle changes helped resolve secondary dysmenorrhea.",['Matsushita S; Wong B; Kanumalla R; Goldstein L'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32598462,dysmenorrhea is a common cause of acute pelvic pain. it affects approximately two-thirds of women postmenarchal in the united states. primary dysmenorrhea is likely due to an excess of prostaglandins.
Does reproductive stage impact cardiovascular disease risk factors? Results from a population-based cohort in Lausanne (CoLaus study).,"Menopause has been associated with adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile, yet it is unclear whether the changes in CVD risk factors differ by reproductive stage independently of underlying ageing trajectories. The CoLaus study is a prospective population-based cohort study in Lausanne, Switzerland. We used data from women at baseline and follow-up (mean: 5.6 ± 0.5 years) from 2003 to 2012 who did not use hormone therapy. We classified women into (i) premenopausal, (ii) menopausal transition, (iii) early (≤5 years) and (iv) late (&gt;5 years) postmenopausal by comparing their menstruation status at baseline and follow-up. We measured fasting lipids, glucose and cardiovascular inflammatory markers. We used repeated measures (linear mixed models) for longitudinal analysis, using premenopausal women as a reference category. We adjusted analyses for age, medications and lifestyle factors. We used the data from 1710 women aged 35-75 years. Longitudinal analysis showed that the changes in CVD risk factors were not different in the other three menopausal categories compared to premenopausal women. When age was used as a predictor variable and adjusted for menopause status, most CVD risk factors increased, while interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β decreased with advancing age. The current study suggests that women have a worsening cardiovascular risk profile as they age, and although menopausal women may have higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors compared to premenopausal women at any given time, the 5-year changes in cardiovascular risk factors may not depend on the reproductive stage.",['Raguindin PF; Cardona I; Muka T; Lambrinoudaki I; Gebhard C; Franco OH; Marques-Vidal P; Glisic M'],2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377481,"women aged 35-75 years were classified into premenopausal, early and late postmenopausal. women were compared to premenopausal women."
The effect of perceived stress on menstrual complaints in university students.,"Studies have examined the effect of stress on dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome. For this reason in this study, it was aimed to determine the impact of stress on menstrual symptoms (adverse effects, abdominal pain, and coping methods). This descriptive and correlational study was conducted with 351 university students in Turkey by sharing the link to the questionnaire on online social media platforms. It was determined that those whose income was equal to their expenses had lower menstrual symptoms, having a chronic disease and smoking increased menstrual symptoms (F = 3.19/<i>p</i> = .04; <i>t</i> = 2.33/<i>p</i> = .02; <i>t</i> = 3.96/p = .00). The study identified that there was a positive low-level correlation (r: 0.25, <i>p</i> < .01) between the Perceived Stress Scale-14 and the Menstruation Symptom Questionnaire, and the 6.5 percent change in menstrual symptoms was explained by perceived stress. In the study, it is thought that stress affects the experience of menstrual symptoms. Therefore, it is believed that by providing training on stress and effective coping methods by midwives and nurses, menstrual symptoms can be reduced, contributing to women's health. For future studies, it is recommended to examine the effects of stress coping methods training on stress and menstrual complaints.",['Yaşar Ö'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38556786,study was conducted with 351 university students in turkey. it was determined that those whose income was equal to their expenses had lower menstrual symptoms.

[A structural equation modeling on premenstrual syndrome in adolescent girls].,"The aims of this study were to construct a hypothetical structural model which explains the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescent girls and to test the fitness with collected data. The participants were 1,087 adolescent girls from 3 high schools and 5 middle schools in B city. Data were collected from July 3 to October 15, 2012 using self-reported questionnaires and were analyzed using PASW 18.0 and AMOS 16.0 programs. The overall fitness indices of hypothetical model were good (χ² =1555, p<.001), χ²/df=4.40, SRMR=.04, GFI=.91, RMSEA=.05, NFI=.90, TLI=.91, CFI=.92, AIC=1717). Out of 16 paths, 12 were statistically significant. Daily hassles had the greatest impact on PMS in the adolescent girls in this model. In addition, PMS in adolescent girls was directly affected by menarche age, Body Mass Index (BMI), amount of menstruation, test anxiety, social support, menstrual attitude and femininity but not by academic stress. This model explained 27% of the variance in PMS in adolescent girls. The findings from this study suggest that nursing interventions to reduce PMS in adolescent girls should address their daily hassles, test anxiety, menstrual attitude and BMI. Also, social support from their parents, friends, and teachers needs to be increased.",['Jeon JH; Hwang SK'],2014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25608544,"participants were 1,087 adolescent girls from 3 high schools and 5 middle schools in B city. the participants were 1,087 adolescent girls from 3 high schools and 5 middle schools."
Assessing the effectiveness of a comprehensive menstrual health intervention program in Ugandan schools (MENISCUS): process evaluation of a pilot intervention study.,"Poor menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a globally recognised public health challenge. A pilot study of an MHH intervention was conducted in two secondary schools in Entebbe, Uganda, over 9 months. The intervention included five components delivered by the implementing partner (WoMena Uganda) and the research team: (i) training teachers to implement government guidelines for puberty education, (ii) a drama skit to reduce stigma about menstruation, (iii) training in use of a menstrual kit (including re-usable pads), (iv) guidance on pain relief methods including provision of analgesics and (v) improvements to school water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. The aim of the process evaluation was to examine implementation, context and possible causal pathways. We collected information on fidelity, dose, reach, acceptability, context and mechanisms of impact using (i) quantitative survey data collected from female and male students in year 2 of secondary school (ages 13-21; 450 at the baseline and 369 at endline); (ii) qualitative data from 40 in-depth interviews with parents, teachers and female students, and four focus group discussions with students, stratified by gender; (iii) data from unannounced visits checking on WASH facilities throughout the study; and (iv) routine data collected as part of the implementation. Quantitative data were used primarily to assess fidelity, dose and reach. Qualitative data were used primarily to assess acceptability, context and possible mechanisms. Both schools received all intervention elements that were delivered by the research team and implementing partner. The drama skit, menstrual kit and pain management intervention components were delivered with fidelity. Intervention components that relied on school ownership (puberty education training and WASH improvements) were not fully delivered. Overall, the intervention was acceptable to participants. Multilevel contextual factors including schools' social and physical environment, and family, cultural and social factors influenced the acceptability of the intervention in the school setting. The intervention components reinforced one another, as suggested in our theoretical framework. The intervention was feasible to deliver and acceptable to the schools and students. We propose a full-scale cluster-randomised trial to evaluate the intervention, adding a school-based MHH leadership group to address issues with school ownership. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04064736.

The effect of level of anxiety about climate change on the use of feminine hygiene products.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between women's menstrual hygiene product use and their level of concern around climate change as well as to identify the variables influencing this relationship. In all, 978 women between the ages of 18 and 49 who were of reproductive age participated in this descriptive cross-sectional study. The CHERRIES criteria were followed in conducting the online survey. Data were gathered using the ""personal information form"" and the Climate Change Anxiety Scale for Women's Health The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression. Women were more prone to using throwaway goods than eco-friendly, sanitary goods when their climate change worry level was lower. Age, education level, region of residence, and the intensity of menstrual bleeding have an impact on the hygiene products used during the menstrual cycle, whereas environmental pollution in the area of residence and a woman's allergy status have an impact on the level of climate change anxiety concerning a woman's health. Women who are worried about how climate change will affect their health prefer to purchase sustainable/eco-friendly items. Starting in adolescence, women can receive advice about the use of sustainable products from health experts who are primarily responsible for women's health.",['Hamlaci Baskaya Y; Unlu Bidik N; Yolcu B'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38189102,"women were more prone to using throwaway goods than eco-friendly, sanitary goods. environmental pollution in the area of residence and a woman's allergy status have an impact on the level of climate change anxiety."

Development of American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy standards for training in advanced endoscopy within dedicated advanced endoscopy fellowship programs.,"Training in interventional endoscopy is offered by nonaccredited advanced endoscopy fellowship programs (AEFPs). The number of these programs has increased dramatically with a concurrent increase in the breadth and complexity of interventional endoscopy procedures. Accreditation is governed by competency-based education, yet what constitutes a ""high-quality"" nonaccredited AEFP has not been defined. Using an evidence-based consensus process, we aimed to establish standards for AEFPs. The RAND UCLA appropriateness method, a well-described modified Delphi process to develop quality indicators, was used. A task force established by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy drafted potential quality indicators (structure, process, and outcome) in 6 categories: activity preceding training; structure of AEFPs; training in ERCP, EUS, and EMR; and luminal stent placement. Three rounds of iterative feedback from 20 experts were conducted. Round 0 involved discussion of project details. In round 1, experts independently ranked proposed quality indicators on a 9-point interval scale ranging from highly inappropriate (1) to highly appropriate (9). Next, proposed quality indicators were discussed and reworded in a group meeting followed by round 2, in which experts independently reranked proposed quality indicators and provided benchmarks (when applicable). The median score for each quality indicator was calculated. Mean absolute deviation from the median was calculated, and appropriateness of potential quality indicators was assessed using the BIOMED concerted action on appropriateness definition, P value method, and interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry definition. A quality indicator was deemed appropriate if the median score was ≥7 and met criteria for appropriateness using all 3 defined statistical methods. Of 89 proposed quality indicators, 37 statements met criteria as appropriate for a quality indicator (activity preceding training, 2; structure of AEFPs, 10; training in ERCP, 7; training in EUS, 8; training in EMR, 7; luminal stent placement, 3). Minimum thresholds were defined for 19 relevant quality indicators for number of trainers, procedures during fellowship, and procedures before assessment of competence. Among the final appropriate quality indicators were that all trainees should undergo qualitative and quantitative competence assessments using validated tools at least quarterly with documented feedback throughout the training period and that trainees should track outcomes and relevant quality metrics for specific procedures. This consensus process using validated methodology established standards for an AEFP in an effort to ensure adequate training in the most commonly taught interventional endoscopic procedures (ERCP, EUS, EMR, and luminal stent placement) during fellowship. An important component of an AEFP is the use of competency-based assessments that are compliant with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's Next Accreditation System, with the goal of ensuring that trainees achieve specific milestones in their progression to achieving cognitive and technical competency.","[""Wani S; Cote GA; Keswani RN; Yadlapati RH; Hall M; O'Hara J; Berzin TM; Burbridge RA; Chahal P; Cohen J; Coyle WJ; Early D; Guda NM; Inamdar S; Khanna L; Kulkarni A; Rosenkranz L; Sharma N; Shin EJ; Siddiqui UD; Sinha J; Vanderveldt H; Draganov PV""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38935016,the number of programs offered in interventional endoscopy has increased dramatically. the number of these programs has increased dramatically. the AEFPs are governed by competency-based education.
Menstrual health and period poverty among young people who menstruate in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain): protocol of a mixed-methods study.,"The importance of menstrual health has been historically neglected, mostly due to taboos and misconceptions around menstruation and androcentrism within health knowledge and health systems around the world. There has also been a lack of attention on 'period poverty', which refers to the financial, social, cultural and political barriers to access menstrual products and education. The main aim of this research is to explore menstrual health and experiences of period poverty among young people who menstruate (YPM). This is a convergent mixed-methods study, which will combine a quantitative transversal study to identify the prevalence of period poverty among YPM (11-16 years old), and a qualitative study that will focus on exploring menstruation-related experiences of YPM and other groups (young people who do not menstruate (YNM); primary healthcare professionals; educators and policy-makers). The study will be conducted in the Barcelona metropolitan area between 2020 and 2021. Eighteen schools and 871 YPM will be recruited for the quantitative study. Sixty-five YPM will participate in the qualitative study. Forty-five YNM and 12 professionals will also be recruited to take part in the qualitative study. Socioeconomic and cultural diversity will be main vectors for recruitment, to ensure the findings are representative to the social and cultural context. Descriptive statistics will be performed for each variable to identify asymmetric distributions and differences among groups will be evaluated. Thematic analysis will be used for qualitative data analyses ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Several ethical issues have been considered, especially as this study includes the participation of underage participants. The study has received ethical approval by the IDIAPJGol Research Ethics Committee (19/178 P).

Blunted Cortisol Response to Acute Psychosocial Stress in Women With Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.,"Despite being considered a stress-related condition, it is not known whether the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is dysfunctional in response to acute psychosocial stress in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This is problematic because many women with PMDD report that they are not able to control their stress levels, and a blunted cortisol output has been identified in women with related psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression. The present study is a part of the Premenstrual Hormonal and Affective State Evaluation (PHASE) project, and it aimed to characterize the cortisol trajectory in response to an acute psychosocial stress challenge. Women with PMDD and healthy controls with confirmed ovulatory cycles underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) procedure in the mid-late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, throughout which we collected serum samples of cortisol that we analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The linear mixed model analysis indicated a significant time*diagnosis interaction (P = .008) such that women with PMDD displayed significantly lower serum cortisol levels at +40 through +90 minutes from the time of stress induction. This is the first study to show that women with PMDD have a blunted cortisol response to psychosocial stress. Combined with our earlier finding showing a greater parasympathetic nervous system withdrawal on heart oscillations in PMDD during acute stress, these and other results show that the dysregulated processing of stress in PMDD may be captured using objective study measures.",['Hamidovic A; Davis J; Soumare F'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38451747,"hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is dysfunctional in response to acute psychosocial stress in premenstrual dysphoric disorder. this is problematic because many women with PMDD report that they are not able to control their stress levels. a blunted cortisol output has been identified in women with related psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression."
"A qualitative assessment of the impact of a community-embedded intervention on beneficiaries' attitudes and beliefs about adolescent sexual reproductive health in Ebonyi State, Southeast, Nigeria.","Adolescents and their communities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria have poor attitudes and beliefs towards adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH). This paper reports on the effects of a community-embedded intervention that focused on creating positive changes in the attitudes and beliefs of adolescents and community members to enhance adolescents' access to SRH information and services. This study adopted the Qualitative Impact Assessment approach to evaluate the changes in attitudes and beliefs about the SRH of adolescents from the perspectives of the beneficiaries of a community-embedded intervention namely, adolescents, parents, school teachers, and community leaders. The intervention was implemented in six local government areas in Ebonyi State, southeast Nigeria and the evaluation was undertaken four months after the implementation of the interventions commenced. Eighteen (18) interviews were conducted with 82 intervention beneficiaries including: (i) six in-depth interviews with school teachers; (ii) two sex-disaggregated FGDs with parents; (iii) two sex-disaggregated FGDs with community leaders; and (iv) eight sex-disaggregated FGDs with in school and out of school adolescents. A thematic analysis of data was performed with the aid of NVivo software, version 12. The community-embedded intervention led to changes in individual attitudes and beliefs, as well as changes in community norms and values concerning adolescent SRH. Adolescents reported that following the community-embedded SRH intervention, they have become more comfortable discussing openly SRH issues with their peers, and they could more easily approach their parents and initiate SRH discussions. The parents of adolescents reported that following the intervention, they have become more willing to discuss sensitive SRH issues with adolescents, and frequently make out time to do so. It was also reported that parents no longer use euphemisms to describe sexual body parts, and community leaders now believe that it is all right to discuss SRH with adolescents. Hence, initiating or having SRH discussions with adolescents is no longer misconceived as encouraging sex, and menstruation in unmarried adolescents is no longer viewed as a sign of promiscuity. Respondents also highlighted changes in community norms of, (i) gendered parental communication of SRH matters, as both mothers and fathers have started discussing SRH issues with their adolescent boys and girls; and (ii) public shaming and discipline of pregnant teenage girls are on the decline. The community-based intervention had a positive impact on individual attitudes and beliefs, as well as community and societal values and norms about adolescent SRH. Interventions that take into account community norms and values regarding adolescent SRH should be prioritized to enable the achievement of the SRH-related target of SDG 3.",['Agu CI; Agu IC; Mbachu CO; Ezumah N; Onwujekwe O'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38212841,"a community-embedded intervention focused on creating positive changes in attitudes and beliefs about adolescent sexual and reproductive health. the intervention was implemented in six local government areas in Ebonyi State, southeast Nigeria. the evaluation was undertaken four months after the implementation of the interventions commenced."
"Multiplicity of stigma: the experiences, fears and knowledge of young trafficked women in Nepal.","We undertook a reproductive health study on young formerly trafficked women in Nepal using a new research method - the Clay Embodiment Research Method - designed with their vulnerability and the cultural context in mind. Following a two-month period of participant observation, six formerly trafficked women participated in a series of seven themed (clay embodiment/three-dimensional body mapping) workshops and, afterward, a group interview using photoethnography. We discovered that these women are subject to cultural stigmas other than those related to sex trafficking, such as menstrual stigma, stigma related to pre-marital sex, stigma related to pregnancy before marriage and stigma for having a female child. These can have a deep impact across the entire reproductive lives of women. As a cultural force, the stigmatisation is generated by both men and women, and has roots that lie in Hinduism and the patriarchal value system in Nepal. Nepal is attempting to address some of these issues and we recommend a public health campaign to eliminate the practice of the menstruation and other stigmatising traditions.",['Ong T; Mellor D; Chettri S'],2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31722649,clay Embodiment research method was developed to address stigma in Nepal. six formerly trafficked women participated in seven themed workshops and group interview. they are subject to cultural stigmas other than those related to sex trafficking.
Modern menstruation: Is it abnormal and unhealthy?,The menstrual cycle appears to have evolved in humans and some other species to improve reproductive efficiency by enabling progesterone production without the presence of the fetus. This phenomenon is termed spontaneous decidualization. Repeated menstruation is produced in modern women because of better general health and having fewer pregnancies later in life and limiting breast feeding. The repeated breakdown of a progesterone primed endometrium releases an inflammatory cascade which appears to have short and long term adverse consequences. Repetitive modern menstruation is no longer a sign of good general and reproductive health but a harbinger of possible future health problems. Cyclical menstruation has no intrinsic biological value or necessity in modern life. Spontaneous decidualization can be prevented by using estrogen-progestin combinations or progestins on their own. Newer and safer hormonal products are now available and should become even safer in the future. Hormonal suppression of spontaneous decidualization should be encouraged in adolescent and young women as a health promotional option.,['Goldstuck ND'],2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32526510,spontaneous decidualization is a phenomenon that has evolved in humans and others. repeated menstruation is produced in modern women because of better general health.
Unusual Manifestation of Membranous Dysmenorrhea: Case Report.,"BACKGROUND In the 18th century, Morgagni described membranous dysmenorrhea as the sudden and complete detachment of the decidua during menstruation. This causes intense and painful contractions of the myometrium, aggravated by the expulsion of tissues produced by the decidualization of the endometrium. It is a rare pathology associated with oral contraceptives, ectopic pregnancies, abortions, and natural cycles, with consequent thickening and endometrial decidualization with molding of the tissue of the uterine cavity of membranous appearance. The definitive diagnosis is made by histopathological examination. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old female patient came for urgent consultation for an acute picture of severe pain in the lower abdomen, radiating to the genital area with transvaginal bleeding of 2 h of evolution. She had no significant past medical history. A transvaginal ultrasound was performed and showed an unchanged endometrial cavity. A vaginal examination revealed a foreign body of soft consistency; therefore, a speculum examination was performed, which showed tissue of endometrial origin located in the cervical canal of a reddish spongy texture. The tissue was removed, thus improving the symptomatology, and was sent to the pathological anatomy service for histopathologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Membranous dysmenorrhea is a rare gynecologic disorder with only a few documented cases. According to other case reports, our patient's case, at age 43 years, was an atypical presentation. The clinical features and association with this pathology allowed the diagnosis and its confirmation by histopathological examination.",['Luna-López BL; Zatarain-Mendívil JP; Peña-Borrego J; Cortez-Hernández J; Favela-Heredia C; Murillo-Llanes J; Canizalez-Roman A; Leon-Sicairos N; Barajas-Olivas MF; Morgan-Ortíz F; Magaña-Ordorica D; Castro-Apodaca F'],2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38111179,"membranous dysmenorrhea causes intense and painful contractions of the myometrium. it is a rare pathology associated with oral contraceptives, ectopic pregnancies, abortions, and natural cycles. the definitive diagnosis is made by histopathological examination."
Efficacy and Pain Tolerance of Alexandrite Laser Hair Removal at Different Stages of the Menstrual Cycle.,"Several different parameters play a role in the transition of hair follicles to the anagen phase, with the role of androgens, progesterone, and estrogen hormones and receptors being significant. The effectiveness of laser hair removal (LHR) and pain tolerance during procedure were investigated during 3 different phases of the menstrual cycle. Forty-eight axillae were randomly divided into 3 groups: menstruation, ovulation, and luteal. Three laser sessions were performed on each axilla at a 1-month interval. Blood hormone levels were measured in the patients. An alexandrite laser was applied during LHR sessions. Before each LHR session and 1 month after the third session, hair follicles in 4-cm2 areas in the center of the axillae were counted. Patients self-assessed the pain they felt during the laser application in each session with a visual pain scale. The average values for hair counting in the groups were as follows (M, menstruation; O, ovulation; L, luteinization): M0 = 47.6, M1 = 27.4, M2 = 16.1, M3 = 9.9; O0 = 41.8, O1 = 21.1, O2 = 13.8, O3 = 8.6; and L0 = 49.4, L1 = 27.1, L2 = 15.1, L3 = 9.8. The average values on the visual analog scale scores in the groups were: M1 = 3.94, M2 = 3.06, M3 = 1.94; O1 = 3.50, O2 = 3.06, O3 = 1.69; and L1 = 3.63, L2 = 2.50, L3 = 1.56. Statistical analysis was conducted with Tukey post hoc analysis after analysis of variance. The results of LHR are not affected by changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle in females. Although not statistically significant, it has been observed that pain tolerance during laser application is lower during the menstruation cycle.",['Karanfil E; Görgü M'],2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38394336,"the effectiveness of laser hair removal (LHR) and pain tolerance during procedure were investigated during 3 different phases of the menstrual cycle. four-eight axillae were randomly divided into 3 groups: menstruation, ovulation, and luteal."
Assessment of urinary cotinine levels in women with gynecological complaints at a tertiary care hospital: A pilot study.,"Gynecological effects due to smokeless tobacco exposure are not well studied. This cross-sectional study was undertaken with the objective to evaluate the urinary cotinine levels in women of reproductive age with gynecological complaints. The study was conducted in 2015 at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. A total of 192 consecutive women presenting with gynecological complaints (pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and menstrual abnormality) were recruited. Their demographic details and tobacco exposure were recorded. All of them denied exposure to any form of tobacco. Urinary cotinine level of each participant was measured. The mean urinary cotinine level was 23.60 ± 12.00 ng/ml. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels compared to those with menstrual complaints and infertility: 24.9548 (±12.259) ng/ml versus 20.2042 (±10.9248) ng/ml.

Menstrual cycles and the impact upon performance in elite British track and field athletes: a longitudinal study.,"To assess the prevalence of menstrual disorders and the perceived effect of menstrual cycles upon performance in elite athletes. A longitudinal survey in the form of a questionnaire was sent to female track and field athletes at British Athletics every 6 months, over a five-year period between 1st October 2014 and 1st October 2019 in the United Kingdom (UK). 128 athletes completed an average of 4.2 ± 2.9 questionnaires across the study period. The mean age of menarche was 14.2 ± 1.4 years, 13.4 ± 1.3 years and 12.8 ± 1.4 years in endurance, power, and thrower athletes respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Two-thirds (66%; <i>n</i> = 82) reported consistently regular cycles, 30% (<i>n</i> = 37) irregular at some point during the period of observation and 4% (<i>n</i> = 5) were amenorrhoeic. 87 athletes (68%) reported dysmenorrhoea and 40 (31%) menorrhagia. More than three quarters (76.8%; <i>n</i> = 96) described their cycle negatively affected performance. Amongst those who reported when the negative impact occurred (<i>n</i> = 91), 40% (<i>n </i>= 36) reported this in the late luteal phase and 35% (<i>n</i> = 32) during the early follicular phase. 79% (<i>n</i> = 100) of athletes reported at least one cyclical symptom, of which bloating, lower back and pelvic pain were most frequently experienced. This data highlights the complex interrelationship between women's health and elite athletic performance. Athletes perceive a negative impact from their menstrual cycles upon performance with a desire to manage these more effectively, particularly during competition. Female reproductive health expertise in the multi-disciplinary management of elite athletes is required.","[""Jones BP; L'Heveder A; Bishop C; Kasaven L; Saso S; Davies S; Chakraverty R; Brown J; Pollock N""]",2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38445211,"longitudinal survey sent to female track and field athletes every 6 months. 128 athletes completed an average of 4.2  2.9 questionnaires. menarche was 14.2  1.4 years, 13.4  1.3 years and 12.8  1.4 years respectively."
