This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Affiliations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 662,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Women & health\",\n          \"Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine\",\n          \"Annals of translational medicine\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017\",\n          \"2012\",\n          \"2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This article reviews the current scientific literature regarding marijuana use and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis regulation, ovarian hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility. Evidence suggests that marijuana can reduce female fertility by disrupting hypothalamic release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to reduced estrogen and progesterone production and anovulatory menstrual cycles. Tolerance to these effects has been shown in rhesus monkeys, but the effects of chronic marijuana use on human female reproduction are largely unknown. Marijuana-induced analgesia, drug reinforcement properties, tolerance, and dependence are influenced by ovarian hormones, with estrogen generally increasing and progesterone decreasing sensitivity to marijuana. Carefully controlled regulation of the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is required for successful reproduction, and the exogenous cannabinoids in marijuana may disrupt the delicate balance of the ECS in the female reproductive system.\",\n          \"A total of 254 pelvic sonograms were performed on 40 volunteers in order to determine a cyclic pattern, if any, of free fluid in the pelvis in asymptomatic premenopausal women.

The highest percentage of positive\\u2010for\\u2010fluid sonograms was observed within 5 days preceding onset of menses in both oral contraceptive users and non\\u2010oral contraceptive users. The second highest percentage was observed between days 13 and 21 in non\\u2010oral contraceptive users.\",\n          \"INTRODUCTION\\nSome of the physiological factors and athletic performance might show variation along the phases of menstrual cycle. The alterations seen in these physiological parameters of various systems relating to oscillations in hormonal levels do affect the autonomic nervous system and metabolic functions. Former studies heave inconclusively about the influence of hormones on exercise performance, predominantly muscle strength and rate of fatigue during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Studies regarding influence of these variations during bleeding phase were not done.\\n\\n\\nAIM\\nTo evaluate the muscle strength variations and also the rate of fatigue during various phases of the menstrual cycle in young adults.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThis was a prospective study conducted among 100 healthy adult female volunteers aged 18-24 years, with normal regular menstrual cycles persistent between 26- 32 days (average of 28 days), for a minimum of last 6 months. Muscle strength was assessed by calculating the work done and fatigue rate using Mosso's ergograph and by handgrip dynamometer strength. Each subject was evaluated consecutively for two menstrual cycles in all three phases which were classified as Phase 1- Menstrual phase, Phase 2- Follicular phase and Phase 3- Luteal phase. The data obtained was analysed by statistical tool One-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukeys test. A p-value of \\u2264 0.05 was considered significant.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe amount of work done and handgrip strength was significantly higher in phase 2 (p<0.001) and relatively reduced in phase 1 and 3 (p<0.001) of menstrual cycle. In terms of fatigue rate percentage, phase 2 showed significantly lesser values (p<0.001) as compared to phase 1 and 3 of menstrual cycle.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe conclude that the cyclical variation in endogenous reproductive hormones increases the muscle strength in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Thus provide support for the influence of these hormones in regulation of these parameters in the premenopausal age group.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 904,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23281470\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2137132\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21311577\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 13.701847234753302,\n        \"min\": 1936.0,\n        \"max\": 2023.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1968.0,\n          1966.0,\n          2017.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'name': 'The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism', 'pages': '\\\\n          668-72\\\\n        ', 'volume': '45 4'}\",\n          \"{'name': 'International Journal of Neuroscience', 'pages': '1549 - 1563', 'volume': '116'}\",\n          \"{'name': 'International journal of sport nutrition', 'pages': '\\\\n          299-308\\\\n        ', 'volume': '4 3'}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Affiliations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1153,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; SOAS, University of London, London, UK.; Applied Technologies for Learning in the Arts and Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA.; Said Business School, University of Oxford, Oxford UK.; Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']\",\n          \"[\\\"Department of Reproductive Genetics, Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China. jinfan@zju.edu.cn.\\\"]\",\n          \"['Department of Family Medicine, Health Science University, Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.; Department of Radiology, Health Science University, Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 875,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['industrialization;pollution;populational health;public health;tooth chemistry']\",\n          \"['Community pharmacy;interventions;menopause;systematic review']\",\n          \"['Multiple sclerosis;data collection;data measurements;digital tools;disease management;mixed methods research;self-tracking']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 662,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Women & health\",\n          \"Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine\",\n          \"Annals of translational medicine\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017\",\n          \"2012\",\n          \"2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38109054\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014\",\n          \"1995\",\n          \"2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014\",\n          \"1995\",\n          \"2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title + Abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1177,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Early versus late follicular phase ovarian stimulation: a randomized controlled trial.

In this open label, phase 3, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial using a two-arm design with a 1:1 allocation ratio, 84 oocyte donors were allocated to the early follicular start group (control group, n\\u202f=\\u202f41) or the late follicular start group (study group, n\\u202f=\\u202f43). In the control group, women followed a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol with recombinant FSH (r-FSH) 225 IU. In the study group, r-FSH 225 IU was initiated in the late follicular phase. The primary outcome was the number of oocytes. The secondary outcomes were the number of mature oocytes, consumption of gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonist, and cost of medication. The number of oocytes did not differ between the control group and the study group (intent-to-treat analysis 15.5 \\u00b1 11.0 versus 14.0 \\u00b1 10.7, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.52; per-protocol analysis 18.2 \\u00b1 9.7 versus 18.8 \\u00b1 7.8, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.62).

The initial physiological change in adolescent girls is the onset of menstruation. The most prevalent challenge they face regarding menstruation is primary dysmenorrhea, characterized by persistent or intermittent pelvic pain in the lower abdomen. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of stress levels and physical activities on primary dysmenorrhea. A cross-sectional was conducted in Cirebon, Indonesia, in 2023 included young women who had never given birth (nullipara), aged 17-25 years old, had menstruated, and had no history of smoking and alcohol. The data were collected using a set of questionnaires consisting of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to determine primary dysmenorrhea pain, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 42 (DASS 42) to determine the level of stress and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to determine physical activity. Pearson's correlation test was used to assess the correlation between the variables (stress levels, physical activity, and dysmenorrhea). A total of 150 young women were included in the study. Moderate stress levels (23.3%) and high physical activity (90.7%) were the most prevalent category observed among studied participants. Approximately 42% of them experienced mild dysmenorrhea pain. Our analysis indicated that stress levels and physical activities had strong positive and negative correlations with dysmenorrhea pain levels, with <i>r</i>=0.782 and <i>r</i>=-0.748, respectively, with both had <i>p</i><0.001. This highlights that controlling stress could be beneficial in preventing dysmenorrhea pain among young women.\",\n          \"The 3-year follow-up of a fully biodegradable implantable device closure for perimembranous ventricular septal defects in children using echocardiography. The aim of this study was to investigate the morphologic changes of a novel fully biodegradable implantable device after closing a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) and to evaluate the effect of the occluder on the myocardial function in patients during a 3-year follow-up period. One-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-ups were carried out after implantation with a total of 30 Pm-VSD patients who had successful closure by the fully biodegradable occluder. In total, 30 healthy children were enrolled as controls. At discharge and at every follow-up visit, the lengths of the left and right discs of the novel device were measured in the apical three- and four-chamber as well as short-axis views. At the end of the follow-up, using three-dimensional speckle-tracking conditions, the values of myocardial deformation, including global longitudinal strain, global circumferential strain, and global area strain, were acquired. The fully bioabsorbable double-disc occluder gradually decreased over time and was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning during the follow-up (<i>p\\u2009</i><\\u20090.05). At the end of the third year, there were no significant differences in the myocardial deformation parameters between the cases implanted with the novel devices and the controls; no significant differences were found between the basal segments of the ventricle septa and that of the left ventricle (LV) free wall among the patients who completed the Pm-VSD closure using the fully biodegradable occluder (<i>p\\u2009</i>>\\u20090.05). The novel fully biodegradable occluder is a safe, effective, and perfect alternative for the treatment of VSD. Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the follow-up of this new type of occluder implantation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014\",\n          \"1995\",\n          \"2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title + Abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1177,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Early versus late follicular phase ovarian stimulation: a randomized controlled trial. Is late follicular phase stimulation as efficient as early follicular phase stimulation in a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in oocyte donors in terms of the number of oocytes. In this open label, phase 3, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial using a two-arm design with a 1:1 allocation ratio, 84 oocyte donors were allocated to the early follicular start group (control group, n\\u202f=\\u202f41) or the late follicular start group (study group, n\\u202f=\\u202f43). In the control group, women followed a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol with recombinant FSH (r-FSH) 225 IU. In the study group, r-FSH 225 IU was initiated in the late follicular phase. The primary outcome was the number of oocytes. The secondary outcomes were the number of mature oocytes, consumption of gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonist, and cost of medication. The number of oocytes did not differ between the control group and the study group (intent-to-treat analysis 15.5 \\u00b1 11.0 versus 14.0 \\u00b1 10.7, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.52; per-protocol analysis 18.2 \\u00b1 9.7 versus 18.8 \\u00b1 7.8, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.62). In addition, the number of mature oocytes did not differ between the groups (14.1 \\u00b1 8.1 versus 12.7 \\u00b1 8.5, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.48). The duration of stimulation was shorter in the control group (10.0 \\u00b1 1.4 versus 10.9 \\u00b1 1.5 days, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.01). The total amount of r-FSH used was lower in the control group (2240.7 \\u00b1 313.9 IU versus 2453.9 \\u00b1 330.1 IU, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.008). A GnRH antagonist was used for approximately 6 days in the control group, while a GnRH antagonist was only prescribed for one woman in the study group (6.0 \\u00b1 1.4 days versus 0.13\\u00b10.7 days, P < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the cost of medication per cycle between the groups (1147.9 \\u00b1 182.8\\u20ac in control group versus 979.9 \\u00b1 129.0\\u20ac in study group, P < 0.001). Late follicular phase stimulation is as efficient as early follicular phase stimulation in terms of the number of oocytes.\",\n          \"Role of stress and physical activity on primary dysmenorrhea: A cross-sectional study. The initial physiological change in adolescent girls is the onset of menstruation. The most prevalent challenge they face regarding menstruation is primary dysmenorrhea, characterized by persistent or intermittent pelvic pain in the lower abdomen. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of stress levels and physical activities on primary dysmenorrhea. A cross-sectional was conducted in Cirebon, Indonesia, in 2023 included young women who had never given birth (nullipara), aged 17-25 years old, had menstruated, and had no history of smoking and alcohol. The data were collected using a set of questionnaires consisting of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to determine primary dysmenorrhea pain, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 42 (DASS 42) to determine the level of stress and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to determine physical activity. Pearson's correlation test was used to assess the correlation between the variables (stress levels, physical activity, and dysmenorrhea). A total of 150 young women were included in the study. Moderate stress levels (23.3%) and high physical activity (90.7%) were the most prevalent category observed among studied participants. Approximately 42% of them experienced mild dysmenorrhea pain. Our analysis indicated that stress levels and physical activities had strong positive and negative correlations with dysmenorrhea pain levels, with <i>r</i>=0.782 and <i>r</i>=-0.748, respectively, with both had <i>p</i><0.001. This highlights that controlling stress could be beneficial in preventing dysmenorrhea pain among young women.\",\n          \"The 3-year follow-up of a fully biodegradable implantable device closure for perimembranous ventricular septal defects in children using echocardiography. The aim of this study was to investigate the morphologic changes of a novel fully biodegradable implantable device after closing a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) and to evaluate the effect of the occluder on the myocardial function in patients during a 3-year follow-up period. One-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-ups were carried out after implantation with a total of 30 Pm-VSD patients who had successful closure by the fully biodegradable occluder. In total, 30 healthy children were enrolled as controls. At discharge and at every follow-up visit, the lengths of the left and right discs of the novel device were measured in the apical three- and four-chamber as well as short-axis views. At the end of the follow-up, using three-dimensional speckle-tracking conditions, the values of myocardial deformation, including global longitudinal strain, global circumferential strain, and global area strain, were acquired. The fully bioabsorbable double-disc occluder gradually decreased over time and was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning during the follow-up (<i>p\\u2009</i><\\u20090.05). At the end of the third year, there were no significant differences in the myocardial deformation parameters between the cases implanted with the novel devices and the controls; no significant differences were found between the basal segments of the ventricle septa and that of the left ventricle (LV) free wall among the patients who completed the Pm-VSD closure using the fully biodegradable occluder (<i>p\\u2009</i>>\\u20090.05). The novel fully biodegradable occluder is a safe, effective, and perfect alternative for the treatment of VSD. Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the follow-up of this new type of occluder implantation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summarized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1177,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"84 oocyte donors were allocated to early follicular start group or late follicular start group. r-FSH 225 IU was initiated in the late follicular phase. secondary outcomes were the number of mature oocytes.\",\n          \"study was conducted in Cirebon, Indonesia, in 2023. participants were enrolled in the study. a total of 150 young women were included in the study.\",\n          \"the study was carried out after a 3-year follow-up period with 30 patients. the occluder closed a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) the occluder was a fully biodegradable implantable device. the occluder was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
