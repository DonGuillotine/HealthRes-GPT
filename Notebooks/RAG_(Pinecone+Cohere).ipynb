This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017\",\n          \"2012\",\n          \"2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1176,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"84 oocyte donors were allocated to early follicular start group or late follicular start group. r-FSH 225 IU was initiated in the late follicular phase. secondary outcomes were the number of mature oocytes.\",\n          \"sub-saharan africa (SSA) is plagued by myriads of diseases, mostly infectious. but cancer disease burden is rising among non-communicable diseases. a total of 4,681 incident cancer cases from 2,770 females and 1,911 males were identified. median age at diagnosis for females was 45 years (range 1-95yrs), and 56 years (range 1-99yrs) for males.\",\n          \"the study was carried out after a 3-year follow-up period with 30 patients. the occluder closed a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Pm-VSD) the occluder was a fully biodegradable implantable device. the occluder was eventually invisible under echocardiographic scanning.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Damtew SA; Gidey MY; Fantaye FT; Atnafu NT; Kassa BA; Gebrekidan HG; Bekuma TT; Amogne A; Sene KM; Demissie TD']\",\n          \"['Javadpour S; Sharifi N; Mosallanezhad Z; Rasekhjahromi A; Jamali S']\",\n          \"[\\\"Dalbosco Dell'Aglio D; McMillan OW; Montgomery S\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017\",\n          \"2012\",\n          \"2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1191,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36105791\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19821295\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681554\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practices related to menstrual health and hygiene amongst females of 10-49 years of age; explore the experiences and challenges of women during menstruation; and identify the key predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. Using a cross-sectional study design, we adopted a mixed methods approach for data collection. For quantitative household survey, a total of 921 respondents were selected from three districts of Odisha. Qualitative findings through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews supplemented the survey findings and helped to identify the barriers affecting good menstrual practices. Epi data version 2.5 and R 4.2.2 was used for data entry and data analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate proportion, mean and standard deviation; Chi square test was used to measure the association between categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistics analyses were done to identify predictors of healthy menstrual health and hygiene. For qualitative data analysis, thematic analysis approach was adopted using software Atlas.ti 8. For 74.3% respondents, mothers were the primary source of information; about 61% respondents were using sanitary pad. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years and almost 46% of respondents did not receive any information about menstruation before menarche. Lower age and education up to higher secondary level or above had statistically significant associations with the knowledge about menstruation. Age, caste, respondent's education, mother's education, sanitation facility, availability of water, accessibility and affordability for sanitary pads were found to be strongly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. Traditional beliefs regarding menstruation still persists at the community level. Educating mothers, increasing awareness about safe menstrual hygiene, providing adequate water and sanitation facilities and ensuring proper disposal of menstruation products need priority attention.\",\n          \"All species shed DNA during life or in death, providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via environmental DNA (eDNA). In recent years, combining eDNA, high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and increasingly complete sequence databases has promised a non-invasive and non-destructive environmental monitoring tool. Modern agricultural systems are often large monocultures and so are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is key for efficient and early disease prevention, lower pesticide use, and better food security. Although the air is rich in biodiversity, it has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet is the route for windborne spread of many damaging crop pathogens. Our work suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Here, we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, shotgun sequenced, and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. We show that by monitoring a field growing key crops we can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5\\u00a0months, often correlating with weather variables. We add to the evidence that aerial eDNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, specifically highlighting agriculturally relevant species and how pathogen levels correlate with weather conditions. Our ability to detect dynamically changing levels of species and strains highlights the value of airborne eDNA in agriculture, monitoring biodiversity changes, and tracking taxa of interest.\",\n          \"This paper revisits the concept of medicalisation and considers its value as a framework for understanding the ongoing development of new reproductive technologies, and their impact on women's reproductive decision-making. This evaluation is drawn from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public debate about the first extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) to suppress menstruation in the United States of America in 2003/2004, and subsequent interviews with women living in Australia who had already extended their cycles without it being medically approved for widespread practice. Firstly, the debates about menstrual suppression are couched within a discussion of the ongoing usefulness of medicalisation as an analytical tool. It is posited that medicalisation occurs in a particular social and cultural moment, and is a dynamic process where dominant social relations can be both reproduced and challenged. Secondly, qualitative interviews with women about practices of menstrual suppression are used to explore the productive nature of agency in this particular medicalisation contest. Specifically, the ways in which these women engage with the discourses of 'risk', 'choice' and 'nature', as canvassed by menstrual suppression advocates, reveal accommodation and modification as much as resistance and contradiction. This paper suggests that if the concept of medicalisation is to have ongoing traction as a frame of analysis, such a critique must incorporate a generative discussion of agency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1162,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Moqbel MS; Alhaider AK; Almathen F; Amor NNB; Al-Ramadan SY']\",\n          \"['Rapp K; Wei S; Roberts M; Yao S; Fei SS; Gao L; Ray K; Wang A; Godiah R; Han L']\",\n          \"['Ding W; Ye D; Chen H; Lin Y; Li Z; Tu C']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Publication Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017\",\n          \"2003\",\n          \"2020\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39080311\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26818273\",\n          \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38646704\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

            "Migraine and epilepsy are two episodic disorders that share common pathophysiological mechanisms. The aim of our research was to assess the possible shared etiopathogenesis by analyzing the relations of headache, and seizure triggers, based on information obtained from a national cohort surveying the headache characteristics of 809 patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic/genetic epilepsy. Our study utilized data from a multi-center, nationwide investigation of headaches in 809 patients with idiopathic/genetic epilepsy. Out of these, 508 patients reported complaints related to any type of headache (333 Migraines, 175 Headaches of other types). In the initial phase of the study encompassing the entire sample of 809 epilepsy patients, differences in seizure triggers were assessed between the migraine group (n = 333) and the non-migraine group (n = 476). Additionally, the subsequent part of the study pertains to a subgroup of the entire patient group, namely those affected by all types of headaches (n = 508), and differences in headache triggers were assessed among migraine patients (n = 333) and those with other types of headaches (n = 175). Similar differences were observed between epilepsy patients with and without a family history of epilepsy. The most frequently reported seizure triggers in all I/GE group (n = 809) were stress (23%), sleep deprivation (22%) and fatigue (18%), respectively. The most frequently reported headache triggers in migraine patients were stress (31%), sleep deprivation (28%), and noise (26%). The occurrence of menstruation-triggered seizures in individuals with migraine and I/GE was found to be considerably higher than those without migraine. The most common triggers for seizure and headache among the individuals with a positive family history of epilepsy were determined to be light stimuli and sleep deprivation. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the overlapping triggers including sleep patterns, stress levels, and menstrual cycles, etc. and potential shared etiology of migraine and I/GE. Recognizing these connections may facilitate the development of more precise therapeutic strategies and underscore the significance of adopting a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to the management of these intricate neurological conditions. Further research is essential to explore in greater depth the shared mechanisms underpinning these associations and their implications for clinical practice.\n",
            "Research has shown that there is a decrease in physical activity levels during early adolescence, especially for girls. Previous studies have shown that the social physique anxiety (SPA) may be a controlling factor influencing exercise motivation and engagement in this behavior; however, the potential role that puberty plays in this decrease has not been considered until now. The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of pubertal timing and pubertal tempo on SPA and exercise motivation and behavior. Data from 328 early adolescent girls, aged between 9 and 12 at the time of joining the study, were collected in 3 waves over a 2-year period. Using structural equation modeling techniques, different 3-time-point growth models were estimated to examine if earlier maturing and compressed maturing in girls had differential effects on SPA and exercise motivation and behavior. The results from growth analyses suggest that early maturing (according to all the pubertal indicators considered, except menstruation) tends to translate into (1) an increase in SPA levels and (2) a decrease in exercise - in the latter case, by reducing self-determined motivation. However, no differential effects from any of the pubertal indicators were found for compressed maturing in girls. These results highlight the need for increased efforts toward developing programs aimed at helping early maturing girls to cope with the challenges of puberty with a particular focus on SPA experiences and exercise motivation and behavior.\n",
            "Serial serum hormone measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are reliable measures to predict ovulation. These measures are inconvenient and expensive therefore, basal body temperature charting (BBT) and urine ovulation predictor kits (OPK) for luteinizing hormone are often used to determine the 6-day fertile window. However, BBT does not clearly change until 1-2 days after ovulation. Additionally, while OPK can indicate positivity prior to ovulation, false readings are common. A novel alternative approach involves measuring electrolyte trends in cervical mucus using electrical impedance spectroscopy. Cervical mucus electrolyte measurements are associated with hormone level changes during the menstrual cycle. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cervical mucus electrical impedance and basal body temperature. We sought to determine if cervical mucus electrolyte measurements provided improved detection of the ovulation day and therefore, improve fertility timing for women. 14 healthy women between 18 and 44 years of age with normal menstrual cycles were enrolled in the Observational Study. Participants measured BBT and cervical mucus electrical impedance daily for 3 menstrual cycles using Kegg (Lady Technologies Inc. San Francisco, California, USA). Ovulation date for each cycle was confirmed by measuring hormone levels in urine and serum, and by vaginal ultrasound. Electrical impedance was significantly different between the follicular phase versus ovulatory date (p = 0.007) and between the luteal phase versus the ovulatory date (p = 0.007). A significant difference in the rate of change of cervical impedance measurements in the pre-ovulatory follicular phase was found compared to BBT (p = 0.0225). The sensitivity (+ 7.14%), specificity (+ 20.35%), and accuracy (+ 17.59) to determine the 1-day fertility window was significantly higher using cervical mucus impedance compared to BBT. BBT is considered unreliable for evaluating ovulatory function. Cervical mucus electrical impedance offers a novel measure of electrolyte changes associated with hormone levels. We report that pre-ovulatory electrical impedance patterns demonstrated higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for determining the fertility window when compared to BBT. These findings suggest that changes in electrical impedance may provide an accurate method for predicting ovulation and for measuring ovulatory function.\n",
            "To understand possible predictors of the onset of menses after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment cessation in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP). This exploratory post hoc analysis of a phase 3 and 4 trial of girls with CPP treated with once-monthly intramuscular leuprolide acetate examined onset of menses after treatment completion using a time-to-event analysis. Pretreatment and end-of-treatment chronologic age (CA), bone age (BA)/CA ratio, and Tanner breast stage; pretreatment menses status; and end-of-treatment BA and body mass index (BMI) were studied as potential factors influencing the onset of menses. Median time to first menses after stopping treatment was 18.3 months among 35 girls (mean age at onset of treatment, 6.8 years) examined. Of 26 girls experiencing menses, 11 (42 %) menstruated at 16-21 months after stopping treatment. Most girls with pretreatment BA/CA≥1.4 started menstruating very close to 18 months after stopping treatment; those with less advanced BA/CA experienced menses at 9-18 months. End-of-treatment BA/CA≥1.2 was associated with a quicker onset of menses (14.5 vs. 18.5 months for BA/CA<1.2, p=0.006). End-of-treatment BA≥12 years predicted longer time to menses. No relationship with time to menses was observed for pretreatment menarche status, pretreatment or end-of-treatment Tanner breast stage (<3/≥3) or CA (<6/≥6 or ≤11/>11), or end-of-treatment BMI percentiles (<85.6/≥85.6 and <92.6/≥92.6). Pretreatment menarche status or CA do not appear to predict onset of menses, but pre- and end-of-treatment BA/CA may be helpful in anticipating time to first menses after stopping treatment.\n",
            "This study aimed to explore how natural menstrual cycle phases and dosage of oral hormonal contraceptives (OC) influence the diurnal rhythm of distal skin temperature (DST) under real-life conditions. Participants were 41 healthy females (23.9 ± 2.48 y), comprising 27 females taking monophasic hormonal oral contraceptives (OC users) and 14 females with menstrual cycles (non-OC users). Wrist DST was continuously recorded and averaged over two consecutive 24-hour days during (pseudo)follicular and (pseudo)luteal menstrual phases. Diurnal rhythm characteristics, i.e. acrophase and amplitude, describing timing and strength of the DST rhythm, respectively, were calculated using cosinor analysis. Results show that non-OC users experienced earlier diurnal DST maximum (acrophase, <i>p</i> = 0.019) and larger amplitude (<i>p</i> = 0.016) during the luteal phase than during the follicular phase. This was observed in most (71.4%) but not all individuals. The OC users showed no differences in acrophase or amplitude between pseudoluteal and pseudofollicular phases. OC users taking a higher dosage of progestin displayed a larger amplitude for DST rhythm during the pseudoluteal phase (<i>p</i> = 0.009), while estrogen dosage had no effect. In conclusion, monophasic OC cause changes in diurnal DST rhythm, similar to those observed in the luteal phase of females with menstrual cycles, suggesting that synthetic progestins act in a similar manner on skin thermoregulation as progesterone does.\n"

            "0.92: Women are considered to have an irregular menstrual cycle if their cycle length is less than 21 days or more than 35 days, accompanied by less or very severe blood flow. The prevalence of menstrual cycle irregularities varies across countries. Irregular periods can occur due to changes in the body's levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones, which disrupt the normal pattern of the period. Menstrual irregularity has been found to be associated with various diseases and medical conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Anemia, osteoporosis, psychological problems, impaired quality of life, and infertility have also been recorded. Moreover, a significant correlation between irregular periods and the risk of developing pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, as well as an increased risk of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, has been proven. Therefore, irregular menstruation is considered an important health indicator among women. Physical, mental, social, psychological, and reproductive problems are often associated with menstrual irregularities. Thus, evaluating the factors associated with irregular menstruation is necessary to determine appropriate preventive and treatment strategies and to decrease the associated health problems. The aim of this review was to define normal and irregular menstruation, their types, and prevalence, to recognize the risk factors and causes of irregular menstruation, and to understand their impact on women's health.\n",

            "0.92: Menstruation serves as an indicator of women's reproductive well-being and plays a pivotal role in their fertility; nevertheless, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the epidemiological evidence linking menstrual characteristics as well as fertility. To explore the correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane libraries to identify research articles published up until February 9, 2024. We included all studies in which the relationship between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy rates among women of reproductive age was investigated. We excluded studies involving the administration of oral contraceptives, the application of assisted reproductive technologies, and individuals with a documented history of infertility or partners with a known history of infertility. Clinical pregnancy and miscarriage. This meta-analysis was composed of nine studies involving a total of 399,966 women, and the evidential quality derived from these studies was deemed to be high with a low risk of bias. Compared with a normal menstrual cycle length (25-32 days), the impact of a short (<25 days) or long (>32 days) menstrual cycle on a woman's pregnancy was relatively insignificant ([odds ratio {OR}, 0.81; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65-1.01; I<sup>2</sup>, 68%]; [OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.06; I<sup>2</sup>, 60%], respectively); however, a change in cycle length may increase the risk of miscarriage ([relative risk, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.15; I<sup>2</sup>, 0]; [relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.57; I<sup>2</sup>, 43%], respectively). In comparison to women experiencing menarche at a typical age (12-14 years), those with a late age at menarche (>14 years) exhibited a decreased likelihood of pregnancy (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.91-0.93; I<sup>2</sup>, 0%); and compared with women experiencing a normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4-7 days), those with a short duration of menstrual bleeding (<4 days) exhibited reduced fertility potential (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.88; I<sup>2</sup>, 29%). Short and long menstrual cycle lengths may elevate women's susceptibility to spontaneous abortion, whereas late age at menarche as well as short duration of menstrual bleeding appear to be linked to diminished fertility among women of reproductive age.

            "0.91: Despite the importance of menstruation and the menstrual cycle to health, human rights, and sociocultural and economic wellbeing, the study of menstrual health suffers from a lack of funding, and research remains fractured across many disciplines. We sought to systematically review validated approaches to measure four aspects of changes to the menstrual cycle-bleeding, blood, pain, and perceptions-caused by any source and used within any field. We then evaluated the measure quality and utility for clinical trials of the identified instruments. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and four instrument databases and included peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2023 that reported on the development or validation of instruments assessing menstrual changes using quantitative or mixed-methods methodology. From a total of 8,490 articles, 8,316 were excluded, yielding 174 articles reporting on 94 instruments. Almost half of articles were from the United States or United Kingdom and over half of instruments were only in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese. Most instruments measured bleeding parameters, uterine pain, or perceptions, but few assessed characteristics of blood. Nearly 60% of instruments were developed for populations with menstrual or gynecologic disorders or symptoms. Most instruments had fair or good measure quality or clinical trial utility; however, most instruments lacked evidence on responsiveness, question sensitivity and/or transferability, and only three instruments had good scores of both quality and utility. Although we took a novel, transdisciplinary approach, our systematic review found important gaps in the literature and instrument landscape, pointing towards a need to examine the menstrual cycle in a more comprehensive, inclusive, and standardized way. Our findings can inform the development of new or modified instruments, which-if used across the many fields that study menstrual health and within clinical trials-can contribute to a more systemic and holistic understanding of menstruation and the menstrual cycle.\n",

            "0.91: The literature has extensively investigated potential factors influencing women's performance, including the menstrual cycle and the circadian rhythm. However, review articles exploring the combined influence of both factors remain lacking in the literature. The study aimed to systematically review the literature on the relationship between the circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on physical performance in women. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The search was performed on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar databases. Of the 1205 records identified, four articles met the inclusion criteria. From four articles, two studies found a significant interaction between the time of day and phase of the menstrual cycle with physical performance. The isometric strength increased in the afternoon in the mid-luteal phase (<i>versus</i> the morning in the mid-luteal phase, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and the maximum cycling power was higher in the afternoon in the mid-follicular phase (<i>versus</i> the morning in the mid-follicular phase, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Our findings suggest that the time of day and the menstrual cycle phase affect physical performance, with the daytime potentially having a more significant influence. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited studies and diverse methodologies used to monitor the menstrual cycle phase. This review reinforces the need for further investigation to understand better the combined effects of the circadian rhythm and menstrual cycle on women's physical performance. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=380965, identifier CRD42022380965.\n",

            "0.91: The ovarian cycle has a well-established circa-monthly rhythm, but the mechanisms involved in its regularity are unknown. Is the rhythmicity driven by an endogenous clock-like timer or by other internal or external processes? Here, using two large epidemiological datasets (26,912 cycles from 2303 European women and 4786 cycles from 721 North American women), analyzed with time series and circular statistics, we find evidence that the rhythmic characteristics of the menstrual cycle are more likely to be explained by an endogenous clock-like driving mechanism than by any other internal or external process. We also show that the menstrual cycle is weakly but significantly influenced by the 29.5-day lunar cycle and that the phase alignment between the two cycles differs between the European and the North American populations. Given the need to find efficient treatments of subfertility in women, our results should be confirmed in larger populations, and chronobiological approaches to optimize the ovulatory cycle should be evaluated.\n",

            "0.90: Menstrual health is an important public health concern where it is still considered a taboo, and adolescent girls often lack knowledge about menstrual health, face limited access to sanitation facilities, and struggle with the affordability of sanitary materials. Every year numerous articles are published; however, only a few of them would be influential in the evolution of a particular field. The number of citations received by an article serves as a quality factor for the impact of the article in a particular field. Citation analysis analyses the relationship between citations received by articles. From the literature search, no citation analysis was conducted on menstrual health. Hence the objective of the study was to identify the articles which received hundred or more citations and also to identify the leading countries, journals, study designs, and departments conducting research on menstrual health. Citation analysis was done with search terms pertaining to adolescent and menstrual health using Google Scholar as a database in Publish or Perish software. The articles retrieved were exported to Microsoft Excel. Articles that received a hundred or more citations were screened for the type of article, department, and country where the study was conducted. A descriptive analysis of the hundred or more cited articles was done in Microsoft Excel. A total of 982 articles pertaining to menstrual health among adolescent girls were retrieved. There were hundred articles with hundred and more citations pertaining to the menstrual health of adolescent girls. Cross-sectional study design, Obstetrics and Gynaecology department, India and USA countries, and PLOS ONE journal had the most citations in research on menstrual health among adolescent girls. The top ten articles were on menorrhagia, menstrual hygiene practices, Water, Sanitation and hygiene (WASH), stigma on menstruation, and education on menstrual health. The hundred cited articles on menstrual health among adolescent girls were mainly from high-income countries and were of more observational in nature than interventional. Thus, highlighting the need to strengthen experimental studies on the menstrual health of adolescent girls in Lower-middle-income countries.\n",

            "0.90: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.\n",

            "0.90: The menstrual cycle appears to have evolved in humans and some other species to improve reproductive efficiency by enabling progesterone production without the presence of the fetus. This phenomenon is termed spontaneous decidualization. Repeated menstruation is produced in modern women because of better general health and having fewer pregnancies later in life and limiting breast feeding. The repeated breakdown of a progesterone primed endometrium releases an inflammatory cascade which appears to have short and long term adverse consequences. Repetitive modern menstruation is no longer a sign of good general and reproductive health but a harbinger of possible future health problems. Cyclical menstruation has no intrinsic biological value or necessity in modern life. Spontaneous decidualization can be prevented by using estrogen-progestin combinations or progestins on their own. Newer and safer hormonal products are now available and should become even safer in the future. Hormonal suppression of spontaneous decidualization should be encouraged in adolescent and young women as a health promotional option.\n",

We will also explore associated reproductive tract abnormalities that impact or are impacted by the menstrual cycle. Between menarche and menopause, women and people who menstruate living in high-income countries can expect to experience ∼450 menstrual cycles. The primary function of the menstrual cycle is to prepare the reproductive system for pregnancy in the event of fertilization. In the absence of pregnancy, ovarian hormone levels fall, triggering the end of the menstrual cycle and onset of menstruation. We have chosen to exclude the ovaries and focus on the other structures that make up the reproductive tract: uterine tubes, endometrium, myometrium, and cervix, which also functionally change in response to fluctuations in ovarian hormone production across the menstrual cycle. This inaugural paper for the 2023 MHR special collection will discuss our current understanding of the normal physiological processes involved in uterine cyclicity (limited specifically to the uterine tubes, endometrium, myometrium, and cervix) in humans, and other mammals where relevant. We will emphasize where knowledge gaps exist and highlight the impact that reproductive tract and uterine cycle perturbations have on health and fertility.\n",

            "0.90: The menstrual cycle and its impact on training and performance are of growing interest. However, evidence is lacking whether periodized exercise based on the menstrual cycle is beneficial. The primary purpose of this proposed randomized, controlled trial, the IMPACT study, is to evaluate the effect of exercise periodization during different phases of the menstrual cycle, i.e., comparing follicular phase-based and luteal phase-based training with regular training during the menstrual cycle on physical performance in well-trained women. Healthy, well-trained, eumenorrheic women between 18 and 35 years (n = 120) will be recruited and first assessed for physical performance during a run-in menstrual cycle at different cycle phases and then randomized to three different interventions: follicular phase-based training, luteal phase-based training, or regular training during three menstrual cycles. The training intervention will consist of high-intensity spinning classes followed by strength training. The menstrual cycle phases will be determined by serum hormone analysis throughout the intervention period. Assessment of aerobic performance (primary outcome) and muscle strength, body composition, and blood markers will be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. With a robust methodology, this study has the potential to provide evidence of the differential effects of exercise periodization during different phases of the menstrual cycle in female athletes.
